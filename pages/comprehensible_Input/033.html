					Have you ever wanted to insult somebody in English?
					You are, I don't know what you are, but you are that.
					Or maybe you just want to understand and know if somebody is insulting you.
					Well, today I've got you covered.
					Today we are going to break down the most common, important and funny insults in English.
					Let's go.
					Hello, everybody.
					I am Kyle.
					and here on the channel Pensando Ingl√©s.
					I bring you the realest English on the internet.
					Spoken by a native speaker.
					Native English speaker.
					In a way that you can understand.
					So today.
					Today we are going to talk about something that is very important because it is very common.
					Okay. Insults.
					We have losers.
					We have losers. The losers.
					They're just losers.
					We have very stupid people.
					Now these are going to be insults like you guys used in Spanish.
					Bobo. Tonto.
					Don't you want to know how to say these things in English?
					So in this video, I will teach you ten very common insults.
					What they mean and how to use them.
					So the next time somebody is mean to you in English, you will be ready to defend yourself like a
					professional.
					Oh, this is going to be fun.
					Number one airhead.
					And airhead.
					As a person who is not very intelligent.
					They forget things often.
					And the word airhead is used because it's like saying that instead of brains, they do not have
					brains in their head.
					It's full of air.
					Just there.
					No brains.
					Insult number two dork.
					You're a dork. Quit being a dork. Dork.
					Okay, guys.
					Dork is kind of an immature insult.
					Okay, you don't want to call another adult a dork, but it is something that children say to each
					other.
					Or an adult might say to a child, This is something similar to a nerd or somebody who is not very
					cool.
					Somebody who is awkward and kind of does weird things.
					Okay. Someone who is popular out of.
					So sometimes when my son is being goofy, he's being silly.
					He's being weird.
					Like kids like to do.
					I say, quit being a dork.
					And then my wife, who is grumpy and she says, what does that mean?
					So next time you see a kid being silly, being goofy, being weird, you can call them a dork.
					Number three. A creep.
					Okay, is this one is really important, actually, because it almost has to do with safety.
					Okay.
					Because if somebody is a creep, you do not want to be around them.
					You do not want your children around them.
					You do not want your your wife or your husband around a creep.
					Okay.
					So you stay away.
					Stay away from a creep.
					So what is a creep?
					You are.
					You are just kidding. Just kidding.
					A creep is somebody who makes other people uncomfortable.
					And they say things that nobody should say.
					They look at you for too long.
					That was creepy.
					That was creepy, guys. That was creepy.
					Maybe they touch people when they should not touch people.
					Creeps might be lurking in your window.
					Okay, that's a creep.
					A weird person, but weird.
					And an almost scare free way.
					Like they are invading your privacy.
					Okay? Nobody likes a creep.
					Sometimes dorks are cute.
					Creepy in a dark creeps.
					Nobody wants to be by a creep.
					So my friends now say as creep.
					Number four.
					Deadbeat. You're a deadbeat.
					You are a deadbeat.
					Deadbeat.
					A deadbeat is a lazy or irresponsible person.
					Here in the US, we often use the word deadbeat to describe a father who does not take care of his
					children.
					Okay, because unfortunately, there are a lot of families here in the US that do not have a father in
					the home.
					The mother is raising the children.
					The father is off somewhere else because he's a deadbeat.
					When we say that he's a deadbeat dad, which we say a deadbeat dad.
					It means that he does not care about his children.
					He does not buy their food.
					He does not make sure that they are okay.
					He does not help because he is a lazy, no good, rotten deadbeat.
					Don't be a deadbeat guys.
					Five. Snob.
					What is a snob?
					I have more money than you do, so I am better.
					I have a nicer car than you do, so I am better.
					A snob is somebody who thinks that they are better.
					Major thinks that they are better than everybody else because they are good looking or they are
					rich.
					They have a good job.
					Whatever the case may be, a snob is somebody who looks down on others and thinks that they are
					better because of something that they have.
					Number six. Weirdo. Weirdo.
					Guys, this is a basic insult that you must know.
					You have to know. Weirdo. Guys.
					A weirdo is somebody who behaves strangely or very differently from everybody else.
					Somebody who says or does things that nobody else says or does.
					Now, guys, weirdo can be very mean, or it can be playful, but it depends on the way that you use it.
					If my wife says something silly funny, I've had it.
					Stop being a weirdo.
					Stop being a weirdo, baby.
					That's a playful way to use weirdo.
					If there's a guy at work and he's being a creep.
					He says things that nobody wants to hear.
					He, talks about strange things that nobody wants to talk about.
					You can use the word a little bit more mean and be like, that guy's a weirdo.
					Don't go talk to him.
					He's a weirdo.
					Number seven. Moron.
					Moron. Moron.
					A moron is somebody who is stupid or an idiot.
					getting bullied by a Polito And in fact, the reason that I chose the word moron is because you guys
					already know idiot, idiot and stupid stupid are.
					So I wanted to give you guys another word.
					That is not like the words you already have.
					Because if somebody calls you stupid.
					Hey, you're stupid.
					And even if you're just starting out with English, you will know if he call me a stupid or idiot.
					Call me idiot. That.
					But moron is important to know because it means the same thing.
					You are more. Don't.
					Very slow. You're not smart. Moron!
					That's kind of.
					I mean, when guys, you can't really play around with moron.
					Number eight. Jerk, jerk.
					That guy is a jerk.
					He's always insulting people.
					A jerk is somebody who is rude, selfish.
					They only think about themselves.
					They are not kind to other people.
					They are not polite.
					Maybe they are very mean to people.
					They all the people they bully.
					Other people. That's what a jerk is.
					The guy with big muscles who's mean to everybody else.
					That's a jerk.
					Don't be a jerk, guys.
					Be kind. Number nine. Scumbag.
					Scum bag. Scumbag.
					A scumbag is just a bad person.
					It's somebody who you cannot trust.
					You would not want them in your house because you think they would steal something. Roberta. Algo.
					Okay.
					A scumbag is somebody who you can't trust for anything.
					They lie, they steal.
					That's a scumbag.
					They're not a jerk because a jerk will beat you up in your face.
					A scumbag will try and steal things behind your back without you knowing.
					Scumbag is like a sneaky coward.
					Jerk.
					Okay.
					Sneaky coward. Jerk is a scumbag.
					So, please, my friends, don't be a scumbag.
					And if somebody calls you a scumbag, that's a bad insult.
					Okay, guys, I saved this next one for last number ten because it is my favorite out of the list.
					I think it's a really good insult.
					Mouth breather.
					Mouth breather.
					Oh, breathing out of your mouth instead of your nose.
					So this is a nose breather.
					A mouth breather does this.
					now, maybe you can imagine by looking at my face when I do this.
					What is a mouth breather?
					A mouth breather as somebody who is not very smart, not very intelligent, not very self-aware.
					Okay.
					Because if you're sitting around breathing like this, most people will think, oh, let me close my
					mouth.
					I look dumb.
					I don't want to breathe like that.
					But somebody who is not very smart might just sit there all day.
					And mouth breather way.
					calling somebody a mouth breather is a funny way to call them Tonto.
					Bobo.
					Dumb. Okay.
					Airhead. Now it's mean.
					It's not nice, guys.
					So don't ever say this to somebody who is actually has mental problems.
					You know, who is actually really slow in their brain because that would just be mean.
					butt, whenever one of your friends, one of your friends is doing something dumb, say, dude, you're
					acting like a mouth breather right now.
					You're acting like a mouth breather.
					That's a good insult.
					Okay, my friends, I hope that you enjoyed broadening your vocabulary in English, learning new words
					that you can use to Periyar in English.
					Yeah. Caterpillar. Hope you enjoyed it, guys.
					It was fun for me.
