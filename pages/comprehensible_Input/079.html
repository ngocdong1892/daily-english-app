					hello my friends hello again and welcome back to pensano Eng this will be another intermediate level
					English video so if you do not know who I am my name is Kyle my name is Kyle and here on my channel
					I bring you real English real English that you can understand that's the mission here on pan engl so
					today I'm going to speak in a nice slow easy intermediate English about a topic that is near and
					dear to my heart okay today I am going to talk about why I love Spanish why I love to speak Spanish
					to listen to things in Spanish to consume Spanish why I love the Spanish language all right let's
					get going so there are many reasons why I love Spanish but one of the reasons is because it makes
					your world your world bigger so much bigger makes your world so much bigger what do I mean by that
					well there are 21 different countries in the world where Spanish is the official language 21 okay so
					if you know how to speak Chinese you can go to China okay that's one country if you know how to
					speak let's see H German you could go to Germany okay if you know how to how to speak Thai you can
					go to Taiwan but if you know how to speak Spanish you can go to 21 different countries okay that is
					21 different countries to visit to explore 21 different cultures to immerse yourself in 21 different
					places that have different food different Customs different music and to me that's an incredible
					thing that sounds like an incredible Adventure okay so by just learning one language you have a
					ticket to 21 different countries okay 21 different countries that's a lot of culture that's a lot of
					opportunities to see new places okay to me that is an incredible thing because it makes the options
					that you have of places to explore cultures to learn about it makes your options so much bigger you
					have so many more options that's the first thing the second way that Spanish makes your world bigger
					there are 500 million 500 million native Spanish speakers okay 500 million so that means that by
					learning Spanish I am able to have an incredible conversation with 500 million people that I
					couldn't have a conversation with if I just spoke English that's pretty awesome that is a lot of
					potential friendships relationships business Partnerships okay quick conversations at the store that
					is a lot of opportunities for human connection and that's probably my favorite thing about learning
					a language in general but Spanish gives you the opportunity to be able to connect with so many
					people okay so many different people from so many different places and when you're able to connect
					with all these extra people all these different people you learn so much about the world guys my
					view of the world has gotten so much bigger okay I I follow a little bit about what's going on in
					South American politics okay I know who people like na bu Javier are because I speak Spanish I
					consume content from these countries okay and it opens a whole new world to me that is not available
					to somebody who only speaks English and that's another thing that I love about Spanish okay it's
					like you have a key to a whole new part of the world a whole new part of the internet even okay so
					many YouTube videos I watch are in Spanish and I'm learning about Latin America or Spain and I would
					have never been able to to consume this content if I didn't speak Spanish so that's another thing
					that I absolutely love because I consume probably about 50% of the content that I consume is in
					Spanish so that is a ton a ton of information that I receive every day in my brain is in Spanish and
					it has to do with these different countries different parts of the world different interesting
					people I just love it guys absolutely love it okay another thing that I love about Spanish but that
					is just in general a bonus of learning Spanish New Opportunities okay now the old saying [Music] is
					English opens doors right that's what they said sorry guys I'm speaking in English and I couldn't
					think in Spanish for a minute sometimes when I'm speaking Spanish it's hard to uh think in English
					and vice versa so there are a lot of opportunities from Spanish here in the United States now
					everybody always used to say that English opens doors and of course it does guys if you are a Latino
					and you are in the US or coming to the US you've got to learn your English okay the truth is you can
					survive here which is Spanish there's so many Latino if you go to a big city you're going to be able
					to eat go to a grocery store with just Spanish okay there's parts of Chicago I've went into a
					grocery store in Chicago and I was the only white person I was the only person with skin skin like
					mine okay so you don't have to learn English but trust me guys there will be so many more
					opportunities for jobs friendships just consuming content social media if you are here in the US
					your life will be much better if you speak English but let me tell you that I think there are a ton
					of opportunities for somebody like me to learn Spanish okay if I by speaking Spanish I have a lot of
					opportunities for jobs uh opportunities to go to events to meet new people but even for careers guys
					because of the numbers of Latinos here now it is more and more of a valuable tool to speak Spanish
					and even at my job where I work now it has came in handy several times being able to speak Spanish
					so and some of the things that I want to do in the future I really think that my Spanish is going to
					be a huge advantage and a huge tool for me so it gives you a lot of new opportunities okay one other
					reason why I absolutely love Spanish is because the spanishs speaking Community the Latinos have
					been so kind to me in my Spanish speaking Journey even when I could barely speak Spanish when I
					could only say a couple words I didn't understand anything you guys were so kind to me okay I've
					been to parties where I was the only native English speaker okay and I tried my best to speak
					Spanish but it was terrible and they were so happy to see me trying they were so nice to me they
					encouraged me and welcomed me with open arms okay and I appreciate that very much I love L Latina
					really guys I love the Latino community and it's been a special special journey and a lot of special
					connections that I've made with the Latino Community friends and one very very special connection
					that I've made brings me to my next point and probably the most important reason why I love Spanish
					because without Spanish I would not have met the most wonderful woman in the world my wife my wife
					is Colombian as my loyal subscribers know but maybe this is your first time watching me and if you
					do not know my wife is Colombian and the first 6 months of our relationship was just in Spanish okay
					when I met my wife she did not speak English yet she knew a little bit of English but we only spoke
					Spanish for about 6 months and let me tell you guys this was the coolest experience of my life was
					getting to know falling in love with and just having an incredible time with my wife or with the
					woman who at that time I did not know was going to be my wife but as I got to know her we became
					closer and closer I knew very soon that she was going to be my wife even if she did not know it yet
					so that is probably the biggest reason that Spanish has such a huge place in my heart because I fell
					in love with my wife in Spanish and that was just such a incredible experience that I never thought
					I would have when I was a kid growing up here in the United States I never thought that I would
					learn Spanish but I definitely did not think that the woman I would one day marry I would meet her
					speaking Spanish I would get to know her speaking Spanish I would fall in love with her in Spanish
					and build a beautiful beautiful relationship with her now our relationship is about half English
					half Spanish but because of our time that we spent speaking just Spanish Spanish will always hold a
					huge huge place in my heart so guys those are the reasons why I love the Spanish language and why I
					try my best to give back to the Spanish speaking Community because you guys welcomed me with open
					arms so I will always be here with open arms for you guys to help you with your English to give life
					advice when I can to share the things that I've been through and just to make content that makes
					learning more fun all right guys that's my mission here that's what I try and do three times a week
					to share my journey and bring you guys up with me so we can grow together okay as you guys are are
					learning I'm learning vice versa everybody wins all right my friends I hope you enjoy this video
