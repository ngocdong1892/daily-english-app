					learning
					experience today communication is very important to every project I’d even argue that it’s the most
					important tool in making sure your project runs smoothly many times what contributes to the success
					or
					failure of a project team comes down to whether or not everyone understands what’s happening and how
					their tasks contribute to the Project’s goals as project manager you play a big part in making sure
					everyone knows what their roles and tasks are you’re also the person that team members come to when
					they’re just in need of a quick answer so being able to communicate clearly and effectively is key
					it’s
					important to remember that without effective communication the project is at risk of missing
					important
					opportunities or even failing altogether during a project I recently worked on my stakeholders
					allocated
					a few design Specialists to work with me in the first week of the project I noticed that one
					specialist
					wasn’t attending any of the project meetings I decided to approach the individual about their
					absence
					when asked they stated that they were well overc capacity with the current workload and were unable
					to
					commit to the short deadlines I had been assigning there were a couple of breakdowns in
					communication
					here first between a specialist and their manager and second between a specialist and me the project
					manager ideally The Specialist and their manager would have have communicated better with each other
					about the specialist’s ability to take on the workload if I had not communicated with the specialist
					their continued absence at meetings could have resulted in lots of lost time the project being
					delayed
					or not being able to deliver the project in a satisfactory way as it turned out we only ended up
					losing
					a week of work due to the lack of communication however since I followed up quickly we were able to
					Pivot and assign another specialist to the project so we know communication is very important but
					what
					is communication exactly to put it simply communication is the flow of information it includes
					everything that’s shared how it’s shared and with whom good effective communication is always clear
					honest relevant and frequent but not too frequent there is such a thing as information overload
					effect
					effective communication makes it possible for your project to run on time and up to the expectations
					outlined in the project plan so take full advantage of tools like meetings emails phone calls
					written
					documents and formal presentations and make sure they are accessible by everyone it’s also important
					to
					remember that communication is not a one-time event or a one-way route it needs to happen throughout
					the
					entire life cycle of the project from the project team and stakeholders as well as from you so be
					sure
					to clarify goals and client expectations follow up on action items and communicate delays as the
					project
					progresses this will help you avoid issues and setbacks as the project manager you’re responsible
					for
					creating a consistent flow of communication throughout the project setting the tone for team
					communication and working to make sure everyone’s on the same page every step of the way gives your
					project the best chance to succeed okay hopefully it’s clear that communication is incredibly
					important
					to manage a project coming up I’ll show you how to make a communication plan that will help you
					manage
					all important communication see you in a bit so far you’ve learned some common ways of communicating
					during a project let’s take that a step further by learning how to create a communication plan that
					will
					help you manage all the different kinds of communication that will happen during a project trust me
					there’s going to be a lot of communication so you’ll need a plan to help you stay aware of it all
					and to
					use as a tool for communicating effectively a communication plan organizes and documents the process
					types and expectations of communication for the project the size and complexity of your
					communication
					plan will be different for every project but it is always good to have one especially when multiple
					stakeholders different phrases and change management are involved it will really help you your
					project
					and the stakeholders just like other plans related to the project your communication plan needs to
					address these questions what needs to be communicated who needs to communicate when communication
					needs
					to happen why and how to communicate and where the information communicated is stored let’s break
					down
					each question with a sample communication plan that I’ve created for a plant po project first off
					your
					communication plan should include what you’re communicating on or in other words the type of
					communication this could include things like status updates issues feedback from users daily
					check-ins
					and other types of project meetings then you need to identify who you’ll communicate with these are
					the
					recipients of the information like key stakeholders and the core project team for each type of
					communication record when to communicate this includes the frequency which is how often you’ll
					communicate and key dates like deadlines or major meetings one thing to keep in mind is that not
					everyone needs to receive the same amount of information at the same time generally speaking your
					key
					stakeholders will get their information less often like in a monthly high level summary email or
					project
					review meeting but your core project team could receive more detailed info through daily email
					updates
					or quick virtual check-ins next include how you’ll communicate or what delivery method you’ll use
					this
					could be email in-person or virtual meetings or a formal presentation your plan also needs to
					include
					the goal of communicating this is your why so ask yourself why are you communicating is it to give a
					progress update identify a risk and address barriers or perhaps you need to figure out next steps
					detail
					preparation plans and reflect on Lessons Learned the goal of communication could be a combination of
					any
					of these or some other reason alog together in either case there must be a purpose for communicating
					otherwise you risk wasting valuable time finally include where communication resources are located
					along
					with any other notes I’ll talk more about best practices for storing information in a next video but
					for
					now try to remember that relevant information should be easily accessible so that you your
					stakeholders
					and your team can quickly find the resources they need to make decisions work on tasks get caught up
					or
					provide updates one more benefit to an effective communication plan is that it allows for continuity
					of
					the Project’s operations if a new project manager comes onto the project and sees the plan they
					should
					be able to quickly access past meeting notes and documentation as well as current and upcoming
					communication the communication plan also helps with effective change management the process of
					delivering your final project and getting it successfully implemented when others have access to the
					communication plan after you leave the project they’ll be able to fix any problems that might come
					up
					make decisions or apply similar processes to a new project hopefully by now you’re feeling more
					familiar
					with the ways a communication plan can lead your project to success uccess keep in mind this is just
					a
					basic plan and there are lots of other ways to structure one it all depends on what kind of project
					you’re working on up next I’ll take you through the details of a communication plan and show you how
					to
					use it to manage project Communications effectively and efficiently now that you know what a
					communication plan is and the basic categories that go in it the next next step is filling in your
					plan
					in this video you’ll learn how to set up a communication plan that works best for all the different
					people involved with your project and what kind of information to include in your plan things like
					who
					needs to be involved in the project communication what’s the best way to communicate why are you
					communicating and how often should you communicate there are a few key benefits to to planning your
					Communications upfront creating a communication plan helps improve the overall effectiveness of
					communication keeps people engaged and motivated throughout the project and gets stakeholders
					involved
					in effective conversations let’s try building a sample communication plan so you can see how it
					helps
					with managing the different aspects of project communication we’ll continue with the office green
					plant
					P project here’s an example of a basic communication plan using a spreadsheet before anything else
					think
					about what types of communication you’ll be using throughout your project feel free to refer back to
					your racy chart and stakeholder map which are tools that will help you figure out what type of
					communication might work best for each person group or role in this example let’s say the
					stakeholders
					are busy senior Executives who may not need day-to-day details so instead of daily meetings it’s
					better
					to send a newsletter that summarizes key milestones and project progress to date let’s type that in
					the
					core team on the other hand May benefit from a daily standup which is a daily meeting designed to
					bring
					everyone up to date on key information here each team member briefly describes any completed work
					and
					any barriers that stand in their way this is common in agile project management as it helps the team
					stay coordinated and move quickly throughout the project so we will go ahead and enter daily
					stand-ups
					in this row but sometimes daily meetings aren’t possible for given time zone restrictions or other
					obligations don’t worry there are other ways to keep communication flowing for example the project
					team
					that created this program had daily email status updates for the whole team to report which action
					items
					were being worked on for the day they also used a project tracker for tasks and Milestones to make
					sure
					everyone’s on the same page next up think about who needs to receive information about your project
					these are the communication recipients it helps to look back to the stakeholder map and racy chart
					again
					ask yourself who needs to be heavily involved in the details who who has high interest in the
					project
					who needs only to be informed of major Milestones I already mentioned that key stakeholders would be
					receiving a monthly newsletter so I’ll type that in now also we know that the core team will be
					participating in Daily standups so I’ll add that in as well excellent we’re moving right along next
					up
					up in recipients are the project subgroups for marketing procurement and product development let’s
					add
					separate meetings in for each of those groups in addition to the core team meetings since those
					subgroups are not part of the core team you might only want to meet with them weekly instead of
					every
					day let’s add weekly check-in to each of these great another best practice ractice is to list
					contact
					information and time zones in your communication plan that way you know when people are available
					for
					communicating let’s add that in feel free to hide this column since it contains sensitive
					information
					about people involved in your project there are other ways to list contact information privately and
					Link it for easy reference I’ll teach you how to do that in another video if you’re having trouble
					deciding which type of of communication to use one way to help you choose is by thinking about the
					frequency as I mentioned earlier a senior stakeholder probably won’t be able to attend daily
					meetings
					and they don’t need every piece of information instead you can communicate with a senior stakeholder
					on
					a weekly or monthly basis and you can focus on High level status updates like overall progress
					recent
					winds or Milestones reached and current metrics in this case let’s send out the project newsletter
					once
					a month if you’re unsure it’s always great to ask senior stakeholders which method of communication
					works best for them when you work with your core team on a project you need to get into more of the
					day-to-day details check in regularly and ask how everything is going how they’re doing on tasks and
					do
					they need your help with anything adding a daily meeting for your core team and a weekly meeting for
					the
					subgroups let’s make that happen great meeting more frequently can help unblock issues and keep the
					project on the right track this leads us to key dates listing key dates and times are important for
					coordination for example if you’re launching a product or new process or giving a presentation you
					should list the key dates keep in mind not every type of communication needs a specific key date
					listed
					for example with daily or weekly Communications you might not need to specify the actual date every
					week
					you could just list every Monday or something like that let’s add in key dates to our plan for the
					monthly newsletter let’s send that on the first Monday of every month let’s schedule the daily
					standups
					at noon and the weekly check-ins are on Wednesdays at 2 3 and 4:00 wonderful now let’s talk about
					delivery methods like email in-person and virtual meetings a shared document that gets updated
					regularly
					or a progress report that gets presented deciding the best way to communicate is a skill one thing I
					continuously need to adapt and work to improve in my role as project manager is communicating among
					different teams and levels of authority a director or executive may only have five minutes so I need
					to
					be concise and know exactly what I need from them likewise I might be used to communicating via
					instant
					message and video chat with my core team however one of the subgroups on the project might respond
					better to emails and in document comments let me add in these methods for our communication plan
					starting with email emails are a very common way to get people in sync but write too much and you
					may
					lose your audience after all no one really wants to read a two-page email one way to get around this
					is
					by adding a note at the top of your email this will alert readers that some details of a long email
					may
					not be relevant to them with this kind of email lead with key points and action items limited to two
					to
					three sentences then include a longer section at the bottom for those who want or need additional
					details the goal of communicating is getting your point across effectively so think carefully about
					what
					you need to accomplish with each type of communication for high level stakeholders ERS in particular
					I’m
					constantly trying to answer so what why should they care about my project the same goes for my core
					team
					what information is going to help make sure they complete tasks on time and stay motivated thinking
					about these questions helps me focus on the most important bits of information to share so let’s
					fill
					this in in the communication plan the goal of the monthly newsletter for stakeholders is to give a
					status update overview great and goals for the daily standups with the core team would be to report
					progress updates blockers and determining next steps so let’s add those in as well all set next you
					need
					to make sure you’re able to reach everyone you need to communicate with so it helps if communication
					is
					a team effort especially on more complex projects you shouldn’t be the only one communicating you
					want
					to enable other team members to be involved in Communications based on their expertise in the
					project
					I’ll add a column for sender and owner to indicate who is responsible for each communication then
					I’ll
					add the sender or owner for each of these communication types starting with the project manager as
					the
					sender for the newsletter great and we are all done keep in mind it’s always a good idea to check in
					with everyone to make sure Communications meet their needs everyone absorbs information differently
					what
					works best for you doesn’t always work best for others some people are more Visual and want to see
					charts and graphs some people might prefer to listen to information through a presentation or a
					meeting
					some people may want to review and analyze information on their own first and then speak with
					someone
					about what they’ve read so if you’re only presenting information in just one or two ways you risk
					engaging some people but not others your goal as project manager is to optimize and streamline
					Communications a great way to optimize your Communications for everyone on the team is by sending a
					brief email or survey that asks three questions what is working in how we communicate with you about
					the
					project what is not working or is not effective in our Communications where can we improve our
					Communications with you this will give you plenty of useful information on how you can adapt the
					communication style to cater to each team member communication plans contain a lot of important
					information and there are so many different ways to set one up depending on the size of your team
					and
					the needs of your project whichever system you choose to use the most important thing is to make
					sure
					your communication plan clearly identifies who needs to be involved in Project communication what
					methods are being used to communicate why are you communicating and how often you are communicating
					so
					that wraps up our discussion on how to effectively fill in a communication plan in the next video
					I’ll
					share with you some best practices for documenting all the information you and your team will be
					communicating throughout the project see you in a bit  now that you’re here let’s talk about
					the
					importance of documentation and how it serves as a form of communication for others to reference and
					contribute to I’ll share an example with you once I worked on a project that involved several teams
					from
					quality insurance testing design partner engineering and program managers each team was responsible
					for
					their own set of deliverables to keep all teams on the same page it was important for everyone to
					store
					their plans and reports in one centralized place this allowed any team member to quickly find the
					documents they needed documentation storage and sharing is very important having plans in one place
					makes communication quicker easier and more streamlined because everyone knows where to find any
					information they need and just as important is making sure your files are stored with clear labels
					or
					organized into folders for example on my team we have certain reports stored in one central place
					this
					makes it easier for teams in different countries to find and share their research with each other
					which
					optimizes workflow and reduces duplicate work documenting and organizing plans also provides
					visibility
					and accountability your project plan is a great great example of this each task has an owner and a
					due
					date this creates visibility for the members of the project team and accountability for the task
					owner
					it’s common for members of the team and Senior stakeholders to reference your project plan and
					Associated documents when they need a refresher on timelines or Milestones so having up-to-date
					plans
					will help ensure there’s no room for misinterpretation or miscommunication once you’ve created a
					centralized location for your documents it’s time to think about managing permissions of your files
					and
					folders if someone isn’t a core part of the project team you might not want them to have full access
					to
					all of the meeting notes instead summarize the relevant information into a status report for those
					who
					need to stay informed of final outcomes but don’t need all background information there’s another
					big
					benefit to setting up your project plans and centralizing them in one place continuity as the
					project
					manager there could be times when you need to suddenly leave the project say you got sick
					transferred to
					another project or needed to take a leave of absence another project manager may need to step in and
					if
					all the project information is scattered across unorganized personal notes it’s not very helpful but
					if
					you docu mented all the plans in one place the new project manager can find everything they need and
					pick up right where you left off so it’s always useful to store guides manuals meeting notes plans
					and
					processes all in a centralized place and clearly labeled you’ll also want to make sure the people in
					relevant roles are granted access to those documents so even if you’re not present the project can
					carry
					on as project manager it’s your job to ensure that project data can be accessed in the future by
					others
					documenting your plans and making them available is part of a project management best practice
					called
					Knowledge Management if someone needs to review this project for making decisions or planning
					similar
					projects they should be able to easily access the information they need it also helps set the tone
					for
					future projects and future project managers which can be incredibly helpful if you happen to be the
					one
					jumping onto a new project for example if an architect is working on a kitchen remodel and they want
					to
					make a decision about the design they can look at the old project plans to understand why the
					decision
					was made to put the sync in a certain location or if a new architect comes in halfway through the
					remodel they might want to know why the other architect designed the plumbing a certain way by
					looking
					at the old plans they can go back and get the information and context they need to move forward with
					more informed decisions it’s also important to determine what kind of information to share with whom
					and
					when focus on the key information related to what specific individuals need to know think about this
					scenario a project manager who’s working with all the VPS at their company decides to send out daily
					updates from a communication standpoint what could be the potential impact of the project manager’s
					decision well since VPS get lots of emails they’re not likely to read the updates that ends up being
					a
					waste of time for you also when you send a lot of unnecessary information then it’s hard to tell
					what’s
					really important figuring out the right information to share is even more important when you’re
					working
					on projects that have sensitive data in those cases you need to be very careful of how you share
					information about your project with stakeholders who do not have permissions to view sensitive data
					for
					example financial data or user survey results are often highly sensitive and should never be made
					available to unauthorized viewers here’s another scenario let’s say your team is working on a
					high-profile launch of a brand new product say an electric car most people don’t need to know all of
					the
					thinking behind the project or see all the draft versions but they do need to know what the final
					design
					will look like the project is legally sensitive and you want to avoid leaks and oversharing
					classified
					data if you share the entire project folder with everyone who needs to know only the end result you
					risk
					doing just that revealing highly sensitive and classified data if this information gets leaked to
					the
					wrong people project plans and Company data could be made public ruining the big launch of the
					electric
					car you also risk violating company policy and damaging your reputation as a trustworthy and
					responsible
					project manager only share information on a need to know basis it’s your job to present the right
					information at the right time to the right people now let me show you an example in this sample
					communication plan one of the resources is user feedback surveys this resource contains raw data
					collected from surveys submitted by plant Pal’s test users which means it has personally
					identifiable
					information or pii pii is anything that possibly reveals someone’s identity like a screen name
					password
					phone number email address first or last name anything like that for that reason only share that
					resource with the members of the project team who are approved to access this level of information
					then
					if anyone else tries to open the document they will be alerted that they need to request permission
					to
					access it if you need to share results of these surveys those can be presented in a graph chart or
					summarized in a report without any pii included then you can share that information with the broader
					team now you have a better understanding of how important documentation is to project management
					coming
					up next we’ll learn the best way to put your plan together and stay organized see you later so far
					in
					this course you’ve filled in or created some different project planning resources like the project
					plan
					budget racy chart risk management plan and now a Communications plan we also discussed the
					importance of
					organizing your Communications and having easy and appropriate access to project plans now I’ll show
					you
					one way you can organize all your project information in one centralized place you’ll be able to
					apply
					these same general techniques to almost any type of project management style or system organizing
					your
					project plans makes everyone’s job easier and eliminates opportunity for confusion as a project
					manager
					your goal is to have all of your project resources documented and linked in a way to where you or
					anyone
					on the project can access what they need quickly a couple of Handy ways to get organized are using a
					shared file drive like Google Drive and creating one resource like a document or spreadsheet that
					links
					all of the files and resources that your project uses here’s an example of how to organize your
					files in
					Google Google drive but it doesn’t matter which shared system your project team uses you can use the
					same process for pretty much all of them first create a new folder and label it with the name of
					your
					project use this folder to store all your project files you can even create subfolders and store
					them in
					the main project folder done you can also stay organized by creating a centralized planning document
					that links everything together this can serve as a quick reference guide that you can use to find
					all
					your frequently accessed files in one place here’s an office Green example that’s already been
					started
					one at a time select a resource name then link it now you can access the file directly from the
					centralized document if your project uses multiple spreadsheets and you want to avoid having to open
					lots of separate files you can group them within one sheet like this this sheet has tabs for all the
					other sheets that contain project information you can add a new sheet at any time it’s helpful to
					include an overview sheet and Link any non-s spreadsheet files this is also a good place to provide
					a
					brief description of the project instructions for how to use the sheet or communication expectations
					in
					this example the overview sheet is called the dashboard which is the same thing you can decide
					decide
					how to label yours there you have it now you’re organized and ready to show everyone what an awesome
					project manager you are you’ve done a lot of work so far let’s take a moment to review all you
					learned
					in this course first you learned the key components of the planning phase and explored how proper
					planning ensures that milestones and tasks are completed next you learned why it is necessary to
					create
					and manage a project plan how to utilize time estimation methods to prevent project failure how to
					get
					viable estimates using soft skills and which tools you can use to build a project plan then you
					learned
					what the components of a project budget are how the budget process works and the concepts behind
					estimating and tracking a project budget and we we discussed how the procurement process flows to
					manage
					paperwork bids proposals and performance you also learned about risk management and how it helps
					prevent
					project failure you learned how to identify risks and measure their impact on a project and how to
					communicate and monitor potential risks once they’re identified finally you learned how important it
					is
					to document plans you learned how to organize plans to provide visibility and accountability and
					what
					elements of a simple communication plan are vital to project success in the next course you’ll
					continue
					on to executing and closing a project where my colleague Alita will be your guide she’s going to
					teach
					you all about tracking and measuring project progress risk management using data to make decisions
					and
					effective project communication I had a Wonder full time sharing my project management experience of
					you
