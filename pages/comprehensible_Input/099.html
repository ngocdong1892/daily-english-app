					an important part of life have having people to share the good times with to help you out in the bad
					times just to talk with uh to get things off your chest to get something off your chest guys this is
					your chest to get something off your chest means to express it to talk about it okay that's a good
					expression in English maybe you're having a fight with your husband or wife you call your friend hey
					can I talk with you I really got to get this off my chest that means you're upset about something
					and you really need to talk about it to get it off your chest but a friend is a person who will be
					there for you when you're upset and you need to get something off your chest so guys this video is
					going to be like some of my original videos I used to make I haven't made any like this in a while
					where I talk about my experiences with a certain topic guys I used to do that all the time my old
					videos always used to be Miss Miss experiencias con Miss experiencias con okay so in this video I'm
					going to talk about my experiences with different friends in my life okay and this is just a
					conversation between friends okay just like you would have with a friend who speaks English so guys
					I'm I've always been a bit of a loner okay a loner is what we call somebody who is not very loud
					loud loud okay they don't talk talk very much I talk a lot more now than I used to in the past but
					I'm somebody who likes to be alone I find Peace by myself I like to go for walks by myself I like to
					make my videos I like to go to the gym and exercise by myself I go to restaurants and eat by myself
					okay some people do not like to be alone me I do like to be alone I like to have good friends and
					see them and spend time with them but I also like to be with myself so that's the kind of person I
					am I've never been somebody who has a lot a ton of friends okay I prefer to have a couple of really
					good friends and then also have my alone time so let's talk about some of the friendships I've had
					in my life what we've done together how the friendship was and uh maybe we'll talk about the
					importance of friendship and things like that so let's see my very first friend his name was Pete
					Petey okay and he is my mom's best friend her son so we grew up together uh you know we would always
					see each other when our moms came to hang out to be together so he and I were best friends ever
					since we were born up until maybe 12 13 14 years old and then we kind of grew apart but uh I would
					go stay the night at his house we would hang out watch movies go play outside little kid stuff okay
					but uh I haven't talked to him in years and years and years something really weird guys that
					happened with pety uh when years ago my dad before he passed away he got a job working at at a
					factory and pety also worked at this Factory and pety and my dad became close friends isn't that
					weird that's pretty weird I think so my best friend from childhood eventually became close friends
					with my dad and it's strange because my dad and I did not have a relationship at that time so it's
					weird but it happened so pety was uh one of my my best friends growing up I also spent a lot of time
					with a cousin of mine uh Mark he and I were like brothers we were like brothers and at the time when
					pety and I started to grow apart I started spending my time more with my cousin Mark uh I would go
					stay at his house every weekend pretty much and his parents were divorced so one weekend he would be
					with his mom the next with his dad so so it was like every weekend we spent together I would go to
					his dad's house one weekend the next weekend I would go to his mom's back and forth back and forth
					because we were like brothers we were always together um and probably from the time I was like 10 11
					12 to the time up until I was probably like 16 we were spending pretty much every weekend together
					hanging out we would uh when we were at his mom's house she had a pool so we would swim play outside
					do stuff like that go on walks outside he had a little sister so we would hang out with her too uh
					when we were at his dad's house his dad's house was way in uh the country we say you guys would say
					Campo so there was like Forest like BOS all around so what we would do there is we would go play in
					the woods we would uh dig holes I don't know weird stuff guys make fires uh try and climb up trees
					and sometimes we would play video games he had video games I've never liked video games guys but uh
					he had them so we would do that we watch movies a lot and we were just there for each other guys so
					once I got to be about 17 we started to go our separate ways you know he started making friends in
					his school I started making friends in my school and we just slowly started spending less and less
					time together and now we we only talk when we see each other maybe once or twice a year at family
					events you know it it I I would like to be closer with him because we were brothers growing up but
					that's life guys he lives a few hours away from me in the capital of my state of Indiana
					Indianapolis so we don't get to see each other much uh who knows maybe one day something will bring
					us together and we'll be close again you never know so after that when I was about 17 I met a friend
					named Nick and we became pretty close we were hanging out hanging out is to spend time together we
					were hanging out pretty much every day after school uh we would play video games talk about girls
					and stuff uh Nick and I would do some dumb stuff too guys some stuff I'm not proud of like we would
					go buy eggs Wes we would buy eggs and then we would drive around and find people to throw them at
					Don't Judge Me guys please I know it was not nice it was not nice and uh just dumb stuff like that
					guys we weren't hurting anybody but we were doing dumb and mean things you know stupid things that
					kids do some funny things we did together but anyway uh I hung out with Nick probably from when I
					was 17 to when I was 18 we were pretty close friends but guys he was a a negative guy he he was not
					never trying to better himself so we grew apart we grew apart and my senior year the last year of
					high school I joined um the bowling team bowling I joined the bowling team at my high school because
					some friends some friends of mine told me to join because they needed an extra player and there is
					where I met the best friend I ever had whose name is Will okay uh I still talk with will every now
					and then but we grew apart also because he has like six kids you know I have my kid he's married I'm
					married and uh you know we just we grew apart guys so let me tell you a little bit about the
					relationship I had with Will and why he was the best friend I ever had so we would do bowling a
					couple times a week and then after that we would just always hang out guys we would always be
					together at that time we were we were always going through some stuff you know he was having
					problems with girl friends uh my family was going through a rough time uh things with my dad and
					stuff and we were just always there for each other guys and you know when something was going wrong
					I always knew I could count on him I I can't tell you guys how many times I ate dinner at his house
					his grandma I call her grandma when I see her hey Grandma because guys she always fed me she would
					give me a big plate of food and it was just nice guys because things were going on with my dad at my
					house and stuff you know things were not going so good but I always had like a second home with will
					you know and uh his his family was always there for me and he was always there for me no matter what
					guys if I was in trouble I would call Will and he would be there and you know I would be there for
					him as well so will and I we knew each other ever since we were like 14 and we were friends in
					school and stuff but we didn't spend a lot of time together but in that year in my senior year when
					we started bowling together we were like Inseparable guys and our relationship lasted from that time
					up until now so we've been friends for 14 15 16 17 years almost guys and uh yeah I still consider
					him a friend but we don't spend time together really so we've done a lot of crazy things guys he
					used to have a girlfriend in Wisconsin which is like 4our Drive 4 hours driving from here and we
					would drive there spend time with her guys we've we've been on so many adventures together we've
					been through so many things uh he got married a couple years ago and I was the the minister the
					person who said do you will take this person to be your wife do you take him to be your husband I
					did that for will uh because he wanted me to have a special place in his his wedding so that was
					pretty cool so yeah trying to think of there's a lot of things I can't tell you guys about here
					about uh some crazy stuff I did with will maybe I'll make a video on the the membership page so if
					you guys want to join the membership and uh get some exclusive content super deep and personal
					content there's a link down below it's $3 a month but there's a lot of good content on there guys so
					yeah will and I were like brothers you know I would watch out for him he would watch out for me
					Will's a very kind-hearted person I have never met somebody with a bigger heart than will and uh
					that can hurt him sometimes because sometimes mean women would take advantage of him and have him
					bring them things and buy them things so his grandma always used to tell me Kyle watch out for your
					brother don't let those girls take advantage of him and I say you know Grandma I will I will and he
					would watch out for me too no matter what no matter what I was going through I always had my brother
					will you know uh my son Connor calls him Uncle will his kids call me Uncle Kyle and uh you know
					we're brothers even if we don't talk as much so I'm very grateful very grateful for the relationship
					I had with Will and he was my best friend up until my mid 20s when I was probably 25 26 I was
					working at this uh this little steel factory fa Deo and I met a guy named Julian and Julian was my
					best friend for couple years Julian is a police officer now he's a really cool guy he has tattoos
					all over himself and he's a police officer but he looks like a like a pandero he looks like a gang
					member but he's actually a police officer and he's a really good guy he's a family man I have not
					spoke with Julian in years guys I hope he's doing great he has a beautiful family and I hope he's so
					happy he just had a son recently uh he has three daughters guys he always always wanted a son he
					finally had his son like a year ago so I'm very happy for him for that uh Julian and I we were
					friends in a time when I was drinking a lot so on the weekends we would have parties and drink a
					bunch of beer at his house we would have a big fire in the backyard and uh it was just some super
					fun times guys and we had a really tight relationship we were really good friends and uh we were it
					started out guys as gym Partners okay going to the gym together and working out together uh I don't
					know we you know you talk with people at work so we were talking and we we were started talking
					about how we're both trying to get in better shape and go to the gym and then one day we were
					getting off work at the same time and we were like hey man I know you're a member at my gym want to
					go work out and that's how it started so we would start working out we had a common goal together we
					would talk and talk and talk as we uh we lifted weights and then you know we would worked together
					the next day and we became very close I had a lot of good times hanging out with Julian working out
					together he was a good dude I got tight with his family and uh you know it's kind of sad that we
					don't hang out anymore but that's the way life goes guys our paths just went in different directions
					I wish him all the best and I'm sure if we we hung out today it would we'd be close again but just
					the way life goes so after Julian I had one last friend you know one last best friend I still have a
					couple friends now that are awesome we hang out every now and then but not all the time but let me
					tell you about the next person who I would spend all my time with that best friend who's always
					there Ernie okay the members of who have been subscribers here for a long time and have watched all
					my videos you guys know about Ernie Ernie was a brother to me as well we met at the same place I met
					Julian so Julian got a different job eventually and then I started hanging out more with Ernie and
					guys Ernie was an incredible person who had a lot of bad traits okay Ernie drank a lot sometimes he
					did drugs okay but I knew the deeper Ernie the you know who he really was and who he really was was
					the kindest most caring person most giving person if Ernie had no money he had only $5 and I needed
					$5 he would give me that $5 and he would go hungry uh anytime I had to move like if I was going to a
					different house to live and I had to move all my things I would call Ernie Ernie would be there
					every time so me and Ernie would drink together a lot but then I stopped drinking and uh we would go
					fishing together guys Ernie died probably year and a half ago now uh and I have not went fishing
					since fishing pasc because that was what I did with Ernie and it just would not feel right guys it
					would not feel right to go fishing without my brother Ernie and guys Ernie you know even when we
					were not once I quit drinking we still were friends because we had a real Bond so you know we would
					go fishing we would just hang out go get something to eat that was something we would always do you
					know I'd call him hey man you want to go get some grub grub is a a word that we sometimes use for
					food want to get some grub yeah man let's go come get me so I would go to his house pick him up then
					we would go eat and you know just talk he would talk about things that were bothering him I would
					talk about things that were bothering me you know stuff like that but uh Ernie and I were friends
					for probably around 8 years before he died so that was a tough one guys when he died it was
					difficult for me because we had been so close and uh you know I don't think anybody on Earth knew
					the real Ernie but me and guys you know like I said he drank a lot and he would do drugs and things
					but it was not because he was a bad person trying to do bad things it was because he was hurting
					inside you know he grew up with his family telling him he's stupid he can never do anything good you
					know he will never uh succeed and that hurt him a lot guys so he had no self-esteem and you know he
					was trying to kill himself with the alcohol and the drugs because he hated himself on the inside you
					know I think he hated that he was an alcoholic but because he hated himself he kept on drinking you
					know and guys you know I don't like to be around people who do drugs and drink but I knew the real
					Ernie so I couldn't abandon him just because he was having problems and stuff you know so I would
					rather be around people who are trying to get better but there was something about Ernie we just had
					a bond and you know I I couldn't uh couldn't stop hanging out with him just because he had problems
					you know part part of me who said you shouldn't hang out with this guy because you know he's he's a
					bad influence because of the things he does but then part of me was like that's your brother you
					can't just abandon him because he's going through hard times so Ernie was a soul a tortured Soul you
					know he had a lot going on inside but I remember he he texted me one time and he basically told told
					me that he appreciated me being there for him and you know he said like everybody needs somebody you
					know that friend who you could just be yourself with and who you know is there for you he texted me
					that and he said you know you're that person for me so yeah guys it's uh it's been weird without
					Ernie you know cuz ever since Ernie died I haven't really had a best friend I you know I like I
					mentioned earlier I have a couple of good friends still but we don't see each other that often so
					you know ever since Ernie was gone I haven't had that person who I talked to you know several times
					a week who we just go to lunch and uh you know talk about what's going on our issues our problems so
					it's been strange without Ernie losing that that person but anyway those were the friendships of my
					life guys now I would say I have two friends mainly two you know friends who I enjoy hanging out
					with and passing time with my buddy Carl he lives in Chicago and we don't see each other all the
					time guys maybe maybe once a month every other month but when we do get together it's really cool I
					really enjoy hanging out with him and I have another buddy named Carlos uh probably about the same
					guys you know once a month every other month we'll we'll meet up get some food hang out actually
					this coming oh next Monday uh Carlos and I are going to meet up and get some lunch so that's nice
					but yeah guys you know I hope one day I'll find another friend who I can confide in and you know
					have that close relationship with because I think it's important to have have friendships like that
					and I haven't had one in quite some time and you know I just hope that it's somebody who I can learn
					from who I could teach who we could both you know get better together because in this point in my
					life I need people that elevate me you know that push my life further in a direction of either you
					know happiness spiritual growth success something I want to be around people who make me a better
					person and you know maybe I could teach that that person some some important lessons too so all
					right guys friendship you got to have somebody to to share the good times with and the bad and
					that's why we have friends someone who will be there for you someone who will come and help you move
					your things someone who you could talk to when you're hurting inside someone who will just get a
					meal with you laugh have a good time that's a friend okay me Amigos Kos graci
