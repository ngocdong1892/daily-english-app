					hello my friends, hello again. im Kyle and here in our channel Pensando Ingles, the mission is to
					bring you real English. real English that you can understand you guys know that I read a lot, I read
					a lot of books I read books about success ,happiness, positivity I read a lot of books about those
					things because I want to be happy I want to be positive I want to be successful. I read about those
					things so I can learn about those something that I noticed when I read these books is that they all
					say one thing. and that is, that we need to be thankful, we need to be grateful why?why do we need
					to be grateful?it has been proven in studies, that gratitude. gratitude is proven to improve your
					immune system your mental health, your relationships and your optimism. optimism is when you see the
					good in things. you don't look at something and say "oh that's bad" you look at it and say "oh
					that's OK, that's good" so I read a quote. and it says....
					riches does not only mean money, its not only money. riches are happiness, love, and peace of mind
					these things are riches. so I think it is very important to be grateful and to show our gratitude
					and to tell the people that we are grateful for "hey thank you so much for all that you do for me I
					appreciate you" but really guys its important to be grateful and tell the people around us that we
					appreciate them so im going to tell you about 3 things in my life that people might think are bad
					things but im going to tell you why I am grateful for them the first one my job. now my job can be
					difficult I can get very very dirty its very hot and I have to work 12 hour shifts and sometimes its
					at night time so I work from 7am to 7pm and sometimes the work is very hard and its not fun its
					dirty and im sweating. it doesn't sound that good right? but we are positive here in this channel so
					let me tell you the good things about it that I am grateful for. im very grateful because my job
					pays me, pays me money that I use to have a home and buy food for me for my son it buys our
					clothings so my job it pays me to live im grateful for that because I have money to have a home,
					have a car, to buy my books and sometimes I have time at work free time at work sometimes ill have 2
					hours a night to read awesome books or practice my languages so I am lucky. I really appreciate my
					job even though sometimes it can be hard I get dirty and sweaty and im tired a lot of the time
					because I work so much. im also grateful for the good things my job brings me the second thing I
					want to tell you guys about that I am grateful for is all of the hard times in my past.all of the
					hard times and the hard things that I have been through why am I grateful for the hard times?im
					grateful for all the times that I cried that my heart was broken, that somebody betrayed me im
					grateful for those times im grateful for the times that I lost money, for the times that I lost
					jiu-jitsu. for the times that I have failed. why?because those things, those failures, those bad
					experiences have made me wise they made me wise they made me strongly I am ready now, I am grateful.
					now im ready for the future, im ready for the future because there were hard things in my past if
					something bad happens to you don't think "bad things are always happening to me oh no what am I
					going to do" think " ok this is a new experience, im going to get through this, its going to make me
					stronger its going to make me wiser" and in the future it will be a lesson that you learn from
					number 3 now this what im going to tell you about this is one of those hard times, this is one of
					the hard times that ive been through in the past the third thing that I am grateful for is being a
					single father. im grateful that im a single father and I went through some hard times to get to
					where I am with my son I fought a custody battle in court with a judge and lawyers, a custody battle
					is when there is a mom and a dad and they say "he should be with me" "no he should be with me" this
					is not a fast thing it takes a long time. it took me almost a year to get my son here with me, where
					he is safe. that was a hard time, there were times when I was very sad there were times when I was
					very angry but I learned and I grew from that, now I am a much wiser man because of it. Ive seen a
					lot of things and experienced a lot of things and now because of that hard time I have a very
					special relationship with my son. that I think a lot of parents don't have. me and my son are like
					this my son tells me 10 times a day "I love you dad, I love you" and I tell him how much I love him.
					we are grateful that we have each other because we have been through hard times in the past now we
					are like this im grateful that im a single father. most people think oh that's a bad situation. but
					I am happy because me and my son are so close, we have a tight relationship and we love each other
					very much and we always tell each other how much we love each other. and one last thing that I am
					very grateful for that I want to tell you guys that I am grateful for each and everyone of you, you
					guys who watch my videos. and who tells me I appreciate you guys so much. it is an honor for me, it
					is a pleasure for me, to be able to help you guys. I salute you. I appreciate you all very much I am
					so grateful for you guys you guys are one thing in my life that I am very very thankful for so now I
					have an assignment for you, I want you guys to write me. write me below 3 things that you, that you
					guys are thankful for. and I want you to do your best to tell me in English, if you have to use
					google translate that's ok. but write it in English so that your brain will get used to writing in
					English tell me what you guys are thankful for down below in the comments
