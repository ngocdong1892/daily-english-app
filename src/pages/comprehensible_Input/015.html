					Hello friends, today we are going to learn English with comprehensible input.<br>
					Now if you don't know, if you don't already know comprehensible input is where a native speaker, a
					native speaker like me, English is my native language.
					A native speaker speaks slowly and uses photos, videos, drawings so<br> that you can understand what I
					am saying. So today we are going to have fun. We're going to have fun and learn English. And I am
					going to tell to tell you three things.<br>
					Three things that are very very annoying. They are annoying. Okay. What does annoying mean? Well,
					mosquitoes are annoying. Ow. Get out of here. So annoying. Mosquitoes are annoying. When you are on
					a airplane and there is a baby crying, that's annoying. Shut up that baby. Shut that baby up. It's
					annoying me. Okay, that's a little mean. But babies crying on airplanes, that's annoying. So, today
					I'm going to tell you three things, three weird things that I find really, really annoying. Well,
					before I tell you the three super annoying things, let me tell you, my name is Kyle and here on my
					channel, Pensano English. For over 4 years, I have been making content like this to help English
					learners like you to learn and understand my native language. So, if you need more content like this
					in your life, give the video a like and subscribe because I bring you new content like this every
					week. And on my channel, there are already hundreds hundreds of videos with hours and hours of
					comprehensible English. So, subscribe to the channel if you haven't already.<br>
					All right, let's talk about some annoying things. So, first we will talk about something that annoys
					me and maybe you never never thought about it. It's a weird thing. And in fact, I just thought about
					it yesterday when I saw my wife. I saw my wife doing this. Let me show you what my wife did
					yesterday. That annoyed me so much.<br>
					Okay guys, now maybe you could not tell in that video what the annoying thing is, but let me show
					you and explain it to you. It really annoys me when people put on their shoes like this. They smash
					the back down. I'll try and find you a picture, a better picture. They smash the back down and just
					stick their foot on like that because they are too lazy.<br>
					Too lazy to put their shoe on the right way. They're too lazy to put their shoe on the right way.
					So, they just take their big stinky foot and smash and smash it down. They smash it down. I don't
					like that. I think that that is annoying. And I'll share a little story that really annoyed me when
					I was a teenager. When I was a teenager, I saved up my money by doing jobs like cutting grass and
					things like that. I saved up my money and I bought some nice shoes, some Michael Jordan shoes like
					this. I bought some Michael Jordan shoes like that. And my dad, he took his big stinky foot and he
					smashed the back of him and used my shoes. He did not ask me, "Hey, Kyle, can I use your shoes?" No,
					he just took his big stinky foot and smashed the back of my Michael Jordan shoes. How disrespectful
					and how annoying. Okay, the next the next thing that really annoys me, the next dumb thing that
					really annoys me, people who do not close close their mouths. People who walk around or they just
					sit down and keep their mouths like this. That annoys me. I think that that is so annoying. And when
					I see it, it makes me furious, angry. It makes me mad. And in the the video that I made about great
					insults in English, you might call these people mouth breathers. Wow, guys, a bird just flew right
					by my head. I hope that was caught on camera. That was pretty cool. Mouth breathers. So annoying.
					And guys, this is a weird one. And what made me think about this is that I saw an advertisement on
					TV. Okay, an advertisement. You know what an advertisement is? It's a commercial.<br>
					It's a small little video of a company trying to sell you something. But there was a comedian. A
					comedian. Now guys, I use the air quotes to say comedian because to me, this person is not funny at
					all. And I really kind of want to punch this guy. Punch him. I don't know why. Do you guys ever see
					somebody famous and just want to punch them? All right, guys. Tell me in the comments.
					Who is the one famous person that you would like to punch? Please tell me, guys. I can't wait to
					read your comments. So, anyway, the famous person that I would punch is this guy. This guy's name is
					Pete Davidson. He's a comedian, but he's not funny at all.<br>
					Maybe you're a Pete Davidson fan. I don't know. But something about this guy annoys me so much. So
					really, he could be somebody on my list of things that annoy me. This guy annoys me. But what he was
					doing in the commercial was leaving his mouth open when he wasn't talking. And it annoys me so much
					for some weird reason. Like, close your mouth. Why is your mouth open? Imagine I'm sitting here
					telling you guys about English, but every time that I stop talking, I just leave my mouth open like
					this. You guys would be giving me comments like, "Close your mouth. That's annoying." So that's what
					he was doing in the commercial. He was talking for a minute and then leaving his mouth open.
					And it annoyed me so much. And it reminded me why I don't like to watch TV. Anyway, that's my second
					really annoying thing. When people don't close their mouths when they're not talking, that's
					annoying. Okay, guys.<br>
					Now for the third and last third third and last thing that really annoys me.
					And guys, I saved this one for last because I think that it is the worst. It is the worst one. Well,
					maybe Pete Davidson with his open mouth is pretty bad, too. So, what is what is the third thing that
					really annoys me? Well, it is when middle-aged men middle-aged men sneeze.
					Au. Okay, hold on, guys. Let me explain.
					Let me explain a couple of things first.
					Okay, first, what does middleaged mean?<br>
					Middle-aged is somebody that is in between 40 and 60 years old. Okay, in between 40 and 60 years
					old, we call middle-aged. All right, now let me talk about the sneezing part. There's a lot of
					reasons people might sneeze, right?
					Maybe they're sick. H I don't feel good.
					I'm sick. I have a cold.<br>
					Okay. When you're sick, sometimes you sneeze. Maybe they are allergic to cats like I am. I'm
					allergic to cats. If I touch a cat and then touch my face, I will start to ache. Okay? So, sneezing
					is not annoying. It's natural. It's part of life. Everybody sneezes. But middle-aged men, men
					between the age of 40 and 60, when they sneeze, it makes me mad, guys.
					It makes me mad. Okay, a normal person sneezes. When I sneeze or you sneeze, it's like this. Aw. Oh,
					sorry, guys. Aw, right?<br>
					Sounds like that. Now guys, there's some older men, middle-aged men between 40 and 60 years old that
					I work with. And when these guys sneeze, it's like this. Why? Why? There is no reason to sneeze like
					this. Guys, I promise they do it like that. It's almost like their wives their wives do not give
					them any attention at home. So now they want to come to work and get attention or something. I don't
					know. But that's how they sneeze. And that makes me almost as mad as Pete Davidson's face does.
					Okay. An old man sneezing like this is almost as bad as Pete Davidson's face that I want to punch.
					Okay. So guys, if you sneeze like a middle-aged man, please calm calm down, okay? Please don't do
					that anymore because it is so annoying. And if you are a middle-aged man and you sneeze like that,
					tell me in the comments below why why do you do that? I am 33 years old. So, in 7 years, 7 years I
					will be 40 and I will be middle-aged. I really hope that on my 40th birthday I don't start to sneeze
					like this. I really hope not.
