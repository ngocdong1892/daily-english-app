					part of the job.<br />But being a great project manager is about more than simply leading a team to
					complete a project.<br />It’s about supporting the people on your team to do their best work and
					enabling people to build things they’re proud of.<br />In this video, we’ll define teamwork and
					explain
					why it’s important for successful project management.<br />The best leaders are able to get people
					to
					work together.<br />That’s why a project manager’s ability to develop and lead teams that work well
					together is so important.<br />But before we go further, let’s pause and consider, what exactly is a
					team?<br />Though there are many different definitions of the word “team,” here’s how we describe it
					here at Google.<br />A team is a group of people who plan, solve problems, make decisions, and
					review
					progress in service of a specific project or objective.<br />Team members rely on each other to get
					things done.<br />For example, a software engineering team might be tasked with creating one
					seamless
					software experience that meets users’ needs.<br />Beyond coordinating with the project manager,
					members
					of the software engineering team will also coordinate with one another as they work toward their
					shared
					goal.<br />Teams differ from work groups, which we define as being based on organizational or
					managerial
					hierarchy.<br />Though people within a work group might be working toward a common goal, their work
					is
					more likely to be coordinated, controlled, or assigned by a single person or entity.<br />For
					example, a
					work group focused on quality assurance testing might be tasked with running a set of test
					plans.<br />The group manager might split up that work and assign each quality assurance tester a
					plan
					to review.<br />But unlike a team, the testers will work independently of one another to complete
					their
					tasks and will coordinate mainly with the manager and the development team of the feature they’re
					testing.<br />Teams and work groups each have unique benefits within a larger organization.<br />But
					for
					the purpose of this program, we’ll focus on teams.<br />More specifically, we’ll discuss how project
					managers develop and lead effective teams by fostering a culture of teamwork.<br />Teamwork is an
					effective, collaborative way of working in which each person is committed to and heading toward a
					shared
					goal.<br />Teamwork maximizes the individual strengths of each team member to bring out the best in
					each
					person.<br />As you might imagine, teamwork is a crucial part of successful project
					management.<br />There are a few reasons for this.<br />For one, teamwork fosters creativity.<br />A
					team might leverage the diverse perspectives, skills, and experiences of their members to devise
					better
					solutions and build products that address more diverse user needs than they might have if they were
					working independently of each other.<br />Teamwork also encourages accountability.<br />The
					knowledge
					that the execution of your tasks directly impacts the tasks of the rest of the team can be a
					powerful
					motivator.<br />And most importantly, teamwork helps you get stuff done.<br />Big complex projects
					need
					smart, capable people to complete tasks and to reach milestones to meet the project goals.<br />As
					the
					project manager, it’s your job to encourage others to actively engage in working together as a team,
					to
					foster creativity, encourage accountability, and to get stuff done.<br />Teamwork is an effective,
					collaborative way of working, and when done right, it can positively impact both measurable team
					results
					and the team culture.<br />Teams are made up of individuals, and individuals are driven by different
					motivators, whether that’s serving their organization, supporting their family, or simply working on
					projects they think are cool.<br />You’ll need to learn about the people on your team in order to
					best
					determine how to motivate everyone at the same time.<br />A few years ago, researchers here at
					Google
					set out to identify the dynamics of effective teams.<br />And through this research, they identified
					five factors that have an impact on team effectiveness.<br />In order of importance, those five
					factors
					are psychological safety, dependability, structure and clarity, meaning, and impact.<br />Let’s
					break
					these down.<br />Let’s start with psychological safety, which is the number one factor that impacts
					team
					effectiveness.<br />Here’s how our researchers define it.<br />“Psychological safety” refers to an
					individual’s perception of the consequences of taking an interpersonal risk.<br />In other words,
					they
					believe it’s safe to take risks within their team, and they don’t risk being labeled as ignorant,
					incompetent, negative, or disruptive.<br />On teams with high psychological safety, teammates feel
					comfortable taking risks around fellow team members, seeking differing opinions, and resolving
					interpersonal conflict when it comes up.<br />For example, on my team at Google, we like to say “be
					direct and kind.” We’ve worked really hard to build a team culture in which we can hold one another
					accountable while maintaining a shared space that is safe, secure, and peaceful.<br />What I found
					is
					that when opportunities to take risks do arise, like pitching an out-of-the-box idea to my
					directors,
					for example, this culture of mutual respect has already laid the groundwork to get direct feedback
					without frustration or worrying that I might embarrass myself.<br />And that’s been invaluable in
					maintaining a high level of psychological safety for the team.<br />Next, we have
					dependability.<br />Google’s researchers explain it this way.<br />On dependable teams, members are
					reliable and complete their work on time.<br />Creating a dependable team requires a combination of
					setting, negotiating, and meeting expectations.<br />Yes, your team needs to meet the expectations
					set
					for them.<br />At the same time, you, as the project manager, need to establish a two-way
					relationship
					with your team.<br />You have to be able to clearly communicate expectations and ensure that the
					team
					feels comfortable negotiating with you when needed.<br />For example, it’s likely that a person on
					your
					team works on two or more projects with competing deadlines.<br />If they’re afraid to share their
					own
					constraints with you, then their work on both projects might suffer.<br />Alternatively, if they
					come to
					you with their concerns and open understanding, and negotiation around priorities could help ease
					their
					burden.<br />Next, we have structure and clarity.<br />Here’s how our researchers define
					it.<br />“Structure and clarity” refers to an individual’s understanding of job expectations,
					knowledge
					of how to meet those expectations, and the consequences of their performance.<br />Each team member
					has
					a clear sense of their individual role, plans, and goals, and they have a sense of how their work
					affects the group.<br />You, as the project manager, can help foster a sense of structure and
					clarity on
					the team.<br />For example, if a project’s structure and tracking are sloppy, unorganized, and
					incohesive, then the team’s output is likely to be sloppy, unorganized, and incohesive.<br />This
					can
					cause tension within the team.<br />Alternatively, if you diligently engage in project tracking,
					your
					team will have clarity, feel more united, and will be able to effectively collaborate.<br />Meaning
					also
					impacts team effectiveness.<br />Google’s researchers define “meaning” in this context as finding a
					sense of purpose either in the work itself or in the results of that work.<br />For example, your
					teammates might find meaning in supporting themselves financially, helping the team reach its goals,
					or
					wanting their products to reach a new community of users.<br />And finally, we have impact.<br />Our
					researchers define impact as the belief that the results of one’s work matters and creates
					change.<br />It can be challenging for people to notice how their work can shift an entire ecosystem
					forward.<br />Part of your role as the project manager is to help individual teammates identify how
					they
					drive impact, both within the team and beyond it.<br />Project tracking can be a helpful tool for
					visualizing progress and impact.<br />Meeting milestones, for example, demonstrates to the team how
					their individual tasks contribute to the larger project goals.<br />For example, my team focuses on
					routing within Google Maps.<br />The big idea is to focus on helping people to get to where they’re
					going on time.<br />So everything we do should make that experience incrementally better, and that’s
					how
					we add impact.<br />To recap, Google’s researchers identified psychological safety, dependability,
					structure and clarity, meaning, and impact as the top five factors that have an impact on team
					effectiveness.<br /></p>
