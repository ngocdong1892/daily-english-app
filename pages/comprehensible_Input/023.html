					Are you ready to learn some real life English with comprehensible input? Well, good, because today
					we are going to improve our English by listening to some facts. Some facts that are disgusting,
					weird, and some that are just interesting. Let's go. Hey guys, it is your English speaking friend
					Kyle. And today we're going to improve our English with comprehensible input. What is comprehensible
					input? Well, comprehensible input is when a native speaker like me speaks slowly and clearly so that
					you can understand. And today, guys, we're going to do a video that's a lot of talking, okay? I'm
					just going to be talking to you guys and telling you guys some interesting facts.
					Maybe you can hear in the background some bells. There's a church nearby and those are the bells at
					the church..<br>
					Today, guys, I'm going to tell you some facts. A fact is something that is true.
					Okay? It's not made up. It's something that is true. Today, I'm going to tell you some facts that
					are uh a little nasty, little disgusting. Some might be scary, and then some might just be
					interesting. We're out here walking around. Connor's with me. We're out here walking around and I'm
					trying out some new equipment. Okay. I got my microphone attached to my GoPro. So, I want to see if
					we could get good video quality like this. Let me know, guys. Does it look good? Does it sound good?
					All right. And we're going to learn these interesting facts, learn a whole lot of vocabulary, and
					maybe you'll think twice before you touch someone else's phone next time.
					Okay, guys. So, I said that about the phones. you maybe you'll think twice before you touch somebody
					else's phones because the first gross fact is that a phone can have 10 times more bacteria than a
					toilet because people like to scroll on their phones while they're using the bathroom and they never
					clean their phones. So phones could have poop on them, other disgusting things. So yeah, I thought
					about this the other day. Somebody at work was trying to show me a video and he passed me his phone.
					He said, "Here, look at my phone. Hold it." And I thought, I really don't want to hold it. Okay,
					guys. So, the next thing that can be quite disgusting that people touch all the time, money. Paper
					money. Okay, the bills. The paper bills like this. They could have fecal matter, which is another
					word for that. And they could even have trace amounts of drugs on them. So, think about that next
					time you're paying for something with paper money or what we call cash. Okay, guys.
					Next disgusting fact is H. Let's go this way, buddy. When you flush a toilet, to flush the toilet
					means when you pull the little lever and all the water goes down. When you flush the toilet, if you
					do it with the lid open, it shoots little pieces of everything that was inside the toilet up to six
					feet. So, think about that. What is it? What is within six feet or 2 mters of your toilet? Well,
					your toothbrush, the towels that you dry off with, many things, right? H sounds a little nasty.
					Okay, guys. Time to take a little pause from the facts. The reason that Connor and I Where's Connor
					at?.<br>
					Right here.
					Connor and I came to this place is because I saw somewhere online that there's secret tunnels here.
					A tunnel is something that's underground where you can go in like the catacombs in Paris.
					And I think we might have just found one.
					If we get Hopefully we don't get stuck down there.
					So, I'm going to go down there and see what there is. Time for an adventure.
					Can you hold this for a sec?.<br>
					Yeah. Just in case. Give me your phone so that I can call for help in case you get I'm not going to
					go far at all, but I need my phone for light.
					Well, can I go in?
					Well, let me go down and make sure it's safe.
					I'm recording you.
					Okay, good.
					Okay, Dad, you can do it.
					Uhhuh. Wow.
					Let me see if the camera will see it.
					Okay, guys. I don't know if you'll be able to see this.
					It's just a Come in.
					You want to come see?.<br>
					Yeah, sure.
					Okay, guys. So, that's pretty cool. We found one of the secret tunnels. That one is small, and I
					can't stand up in it. Connor could probably explore that one all by himself.
					No, I'm not going in there.
					So, we're going to look and see if we could find a a better one that I could actually stand up in.
					See if we can have a real adventure. Anyway, the next fact that may disgust you is it has to do with
					the toilet flushing fact and it is if you keep your toothbrush close to the toilet and you don't put
					a cover on your toothbrush and you don't close the lid when you flush, your toothbrush can collect
					many germs and bacteria. So, think about storing your toothbrush a little farther away and maybe
					getting a little cover for your toothbrush. That might be a good idea. Okay, guys. Next fact that
					could be a little bit disgusting. Humans shed. What does to shed mean? Shedding means that you lose,
					that something falls off of you. For example, dogs shed their hair. Humans shed their skin. Their
					skin. Okay. Every year, humans shed one and a half pounds.
					That's a little bit more than half of a kilo.
					And it falls off in tiny little pieces.
					And what it does, do you know what happens to it, Connor?.<br>
					What?
					It becomes the dust that you see in your house. A lot of the dust that you could see in an in a
					house where people don't clean very well can actually be dried up old human skin. All right, guys.
					So, we didn't find any other tunnels, but did find a couple cool things. Found these AirPods, and
					they work. These are pretty expensive, guys. So, I'm going to clean those up. And we have an extra
					pair of headphones. Let's walk a little bit this way, buddy. Uh, and see a feather.
					Oops..<br>
					Found a beautiful feather with some blue on it. It's a blue jay feather here, bud. I like finding
					beautiful bird feathers. So, guys, next fact. There is bacteria inside of every human stomach.
					And the amount of bacteria in your stomach is huge. There are pounds of bacteria in your stomach.
					Trillions, trillions of little microscopic organisms living inside of you. That's crazy, guys. You
					have a kilogram or more of tiny little creatures living in your stomach. But depending on if you eat
					good or bad, those bacteria can really help you. They could either really help you to digest your
					food, even improve your mood and your mental health, but if you eat bad, they could do bad things
					like make you crave more sugar and even feel depressed. All right, guys. We're going to head back
					now. It's super hot out here. And we didn't find our our tunnels. This is called train tracks, guys.
					Train tracks. All right, I'll we're going to get back to our car and then I'll tell you some more
					interesting facts. See you in a minute. Okay, guys..<br>
					So, we're back home. Connor's in there playing his game. Maybe you can hear him because he can talk
					to all his little buddies on the internet. So, he's in there having fun. I'm about to eat what might
					be the weirdest breakfast ever made. I'm going to tell you guys some more facts, but I figured I
					would just show you this weird breakfast. So, I have an egg that's got some cheese on it, piece of
					bread. That's normal breakfast. Okay. Have a glass of milk..<br>
					Normal. Completely normal to have these two things for your breakfast. But what I have here, guys,
					borch. I've got some borch. So, ever since we went camping and cooked some bors, guys, camera wife
					has been obsessed with it. She loves soups and she really loved this borch.
					So, last night I surprised her by cooking some borch. This got beef in it.
					Got some beef. Got the beets, the potatoes. Anyway, I like to make a big thing for dinner, a big
					meal for dinner..<br>
					That way, I could have leftovers.
					Leftovers is a word that we use often in English in the United States anyway. I don't know if they
					use it anywhere else, but here we say leftovers for when you have some extra, you still have some
					extra from something that you cooked before. So, an example is if I cook this big a big pot of
					borch, if I cook a big pot of borch, I will have leftovers to take with me for lunch at work or to
					eat the next day for breakfast. Delicious..<br>
					All right, guys. Let me eat my weird breakfast. Then we'll do some more weird facts. Okay, guys. I
					had my breakfast and now we're going to finish this video on a part of my house that I really like.
					I'm on my porch. A porch is a thing that's in front of your house.
					Now, not every house has a big one like this, but this is one of the things that we really like
					about this house. Our house, you see the front door there. We have this big space. We have our
					little furniture and then our front yard. It's a super cool place to come out here and just relax. I
					could sit out here and do my breathing, get some fresh air, and enjoy the nice weather when the
					weather is nice. So, let's finish up our video out here with some more interesting, let's say,
					facts. So, a sneeze. Ah, chew. Now, you guys remember from my other video how older men sneeze,
					right?.<br>
					Oh, that's one thing that annoys me.
					Anyway, a sneeze can spread germs. Means it can make other people sick. It can put your germs and
					bacteria on other people up to 26 feet away. That's really far, guys. And I think that those old men
					who sneeze like that, theirs can probably go about 50 ft.
					Okay? So, that's why it's important when you sneeze, achoo, do it like this in your hand, in your
					shirt, something like that. So, you don't shoot other people.
					shoot other people with your germs.
					Okay, guys, those were disgusting facts.
					I'm sorry if they were really nasty..<br>
					Yuck. Nasty. Now, I've got some that are just strange. Some that you've maybe never thought about,
					but are kind of interesting. Humans and giraffes have the same number of bones in their neck.
					We each have seven bones in our neck, but the seven bones in a giraffe are much, much longer. Second
					interesting fact that is not disgusting. Honey, the food honey is the only food that never goes bad.
					It never spoils. In fact, they found honey from, I think, thousands of years ago, a little container
					of honey, and it is still edible. You could still eat it. Edible means that you can eat something.
					So, honey never goes bad..<br>
					Next, there are more trees. You see my tree out there? There are more trees on Earth than there are
					stars in our galaxy. Now, I'm wondering if that's actually true because if you look up in the sky,
					there's so many stars. But then again, how many trees are there just in the rainforest of the Earth
					alone? So, probably is true. Next, a day on the planet Venus is longer than its year.
					Now, this is interesting because we just think of a day as one day from when we wake up to when we
					go to sleep. That's our day. And the year we think of as 365 days. But what really are these
					measurements of time? Well, a day is how long it takes the Earth to rotate, a full rotation, and a
					year is how long it takes the planet to go around the sun.
					So on Venus, Venus goes around the sun faster, then it spins and makes a whole rotation. That one's
					pretty interesting..<br>
					See, now you guys are smarter just by watching this video. You know more English and you know an
					interesting fact about Venus. Next time you're at a party, guys, you could say, "Hey, guess what? A
					day on Venus is longer than a year." And everybody's going to be like, "Whoa, you speak English and
					know about planets. It's incredible." And another interesting fact, there are more fake flamingos on
					this planet than there are real ones. That's a flamingo. It's a beautiful bird. But people like to
					buy fake ones made out of plastic or out of steel and put them as decorations for their house to
					make outside of their house look pretty. So, I guess there's not a lot of flamingos in the world
					because there's more fake ones, plastic and metal ones, than there are living, breathing flamingos.
					Okay, guys. And here are some funny ones. These ones are funny, nice, cute. Okay, no more weird, no
					more disgusting, just some fun facts..<br>
					Kangaroos cannot walk backwards. I guess it's because their tail gets in the way and they can only
					hop forward. They can only go forward. They cannot go back.
					Okay guys, talking about a giraffe again. We already talked about their neck. But something else
					about a giraffe is very long. Do you know what it is?.<br>
					Their tongue. Their tongue is so long that they can use it to clean their own ears. What? They can
					clean their own ears with their tongue. Okay, maybe that one is disgusting, but it's also kind of
					funny. All right, guys. And the last one. It is impossible to hum while you hold your nose. Okay,
					humming is this..<br>
					 It is impossible to do that while you hold your nose. Don't believe me? Try it. Cannot be
					done, guys. All right, friends. Thank you for joining me on this video, the little adventure that
					Connor and I had earlier, and for spending your valuable time learning English with me. I really
					hope that this video looks okay and sounds okay. Like I said, I'm testing out new equipment every
					day. I'm trying to make the quality better here to keep bringing you guys better and better videos..<br>
					All right, my friends. See you in the next video.
