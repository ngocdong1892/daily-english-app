					today we are going to continue we are going to continue segir reading the Curious incident of the
					dog in the night time okay if you have not already seen Parts one two and three check out down in
					the description and I will put links so that you can watch the first three parts and catch up on the
					story okay we're getting a lot a lot of good vocabulary and a whole lot of good input okay here we
					go I said that I wasn't clever I was just noticing how things were and that wasn't clever that was
					just being observant being clever was when you looked at how things were and used the evidence to
					work out something new like the universe expanding or who committed a murder or if you see someone's
					name and you give each letter of value from 1 to 26 where a equals one and b equals two Etc and you
					add the numbers up in your head and you find that it makes a prime number like Jesus Christ which
					makes 151 or Scooby-Doo 113 or Sherlock Holmes 163 or Dr Watson 167.
					all right guys I realize that's a lot and it's complicated but once again that's just showing that
					this kid is always thinking doing math in his head really having some some deep and wild thoughts
					okay it's just once again that look inside the mind of an autistic kid and pretty interesting Mr
					jeevans asked me whether this made me feel safe having things always in a nice order and I said that
					it did then he asked if I didn't like things changing and I said I wouldn't mind things changing if
					I became an astronaut for example which is one of the biggest changes you can imagine apart from
					becoming a girl or dying he asked whether I wanted to become an astronaut and I said I did he said
					that it was very difficult to become an astronaut and I said I knew that you had to become an
					officer in the Air Force and you had to take lots of orders and be prepared to kill other human
					beings and I couldn't take orders also I did not have 20 20 Vision which you needed to be a pilot
					but I said that you could still want something that is very unlikely to happen Terry who is the
					elder brother of Francis who is at the school said I would only ever get a job collecting
					Supermarket trolleys or cleaning out donkey at an animal sanctuary and they didn't let spazzers
					drive rockets that cost billions of pounds okay guys so Supermarket trolleys the supermarket is a
					store Tienda where you go to buy food super mercado now they say trolleys but we have to remember
					that this is uh in Britain okay and here in the U.S we would say shopping carts but apparently in
					Britain they say trolleys okay I uh when I told this to my father he said that Terry was jealous of
					me being more clever than him which was a stupid thing to think because we were not in a competition
					but Terry is stupid so quad erat and most random which is Latin for which is the thing that was
					going to be proved which means thus it is proved I'm not a spazzer which means not like Francis who
					is a spazzer and even though I probably won't become an astronaut I am going to go to university and
					study mathematics or physics or physics and Mathematics which is a joint honor School because I like
					mathematics and physics and I'm very good at them but Terry won't go to university father says Terry
					is most likely to end up in prison Terry has a tattoo on his arm of a heart shape with a knife
					through the middle of it but this is what is called a digression and now I am going to go back to
					the fact that it was a good day because it was a good day I decided that I would try and find out
					who killed Wellington because a good day is a day for projects and planning things when I said this
					to shelbon Siobhan is that weird name for the woman again Siobhan she said well we're meant to be
					writing stories today so why don't you write about finding Wellington and going to the police
					station and that is when I started writing this and Siobhan said that she would help with the
					spelling and the grammar and the footnotes mother died two weeks later I had not been into hospital
					to see her but father had taken in lots of food from Marks and Spencers which I believe is a super
					mercado he said that she had been looking okay and seemed to be getting better she had sent me lots
					of love and had my get well card on the table beside her bed father said that she liked it very much
					the card had pictures of cars on the front it looked like this I did it at school with Mrs Peters
					who does art and it was a Lino cut which is when you draw a picture on a piece of Lino and Miss
					Peters Cuts around the picture with a Stanley knife and then you put ink on the Lino and press it
					onto the paper which is why all the cars look the same because I did one car and pressed it onto the
					paper nine times and it was Mrs Peter's idea to do lots of cars which I liked and I colored all the
					cars in with red paint to make it a super super good day for mother father said that she died of a
					heart attack and it was not expected I said what kind of a heart attack because I was surprised
					mother was only 38 years old and heart attacks usually happen to older people and mother was very
					active and rode a bicycle and ate food which was healthy and high in fiber and low and saturated fat
					like chicken and vegetables and moistly I do not know what that word Weasley is or Wesley I'm not
					sure I haven't seen that before father said that he didn't know what kind of heart attack she had
					and now was not the moment to be asking questions like that I said it was probably an aneurysm
					hardest a heart attack is when some of the muscles in the heart stop getting blood and die there are
					two main types of heart attack the first is an embolism this is when a blood clot blocks one of the
					blood vessels taking blood to the muscles and the Heart and you can stop this from happening by
					taking aspirin and eating fish which is why Eskimos do not get this sort of heart attack because
					they eat fish and fish stops their blood from clotting but if they cut themselves badly they can
					bleed to death but an aneurysm is when a blood vessel breaks and the blood doesn't get to the heart
					muscles because it is leaking and some people get aneurysms just because there is a weak bit in
					their blood vessels like Mr Hardesty who lived at number 72 in our street who had a weak bit in the
					blood vessels in her neck and died just because she turned her head round to reverse her car into a
					parking space on the other hand it could have been an embolism because your blood clots much more
					easily when you are lying down for a long time like when you are in hospital father said I'm sorry
					Christopher I'm really sorry but it wasn't his fault the Mrs shears came over and cooked supper for
					us and she was wearing sandals and jeans and a t-shirt which had the words windsurf and Corfu and a
					picture of a Windsurfer on it and father was sitting down and she stood next to him and held his
					head against her bosoms and said come on Ed we're going to get you through this and then she made a
					spaghetti and tomato sauce and after dinner she played Scrabble with me and I beat her 247 points to
					134.
					I decided that I was going to find out who killed Wellington even though father had told me to stay
					out of other people's business and this is because I do not always do what I am told and this is
					because when people tell you what to do it is usually confusing and does not make sense for example
					people often say be quiet but they don't tell you how long to be quiet for or you see a sign which
					says keep off the grass but it should say keep off the grass around this sign or keep off all the
					grass in this park because there's a lot of grass that you are allowed to walk on also people break
					rules all the time for example father often drives at over 30 miles per hour and a 30 mile per hour
					Zone and sometimes he drives when he has been drinking and often he doesn't wear a seatbelt when he
					is driving in his van and in the Bible it says thou shall not kill but there were Crusades and two
					world wars and the Gulf War and there were Christians killing people and all of them also I don't
					know what father means when he says stay out of other people's business foreign stay out of other
					people's business because I do not know what he means by other other people's business because I do
					a lot of things with other people at school and in the shop and on the bus and his job is going into
					other people's houses and fixing their boilers and their Heating and all of these things are other
					people's business Siobhan understands when she tells me not to do something she tells me exactly
					what it is that I am not to do and I like this for example she once said you must never punch Sarah
					or hit her in any way Christopher even if she hits you first if she does hit you again move away
					from her and stand still and count from one to fifty then come and tell me what she has done or tell
					one of the other members of Staff what she has done or for example she once said if you want to go
					on the swings and there are already people on the swings you must never push them off you must ask
					them if you can have a go and then you must wait until they have finished okay here where it says
					ask them if you can have a go well you would say if you can have a turn okay if you can have a turn
					to play on the swings but here because the differences between British and American English if you
					can have a go on the swing but when other people tell you what you can't do they don't do it like
					this so I decided for myself what I am going to do and what I am not going to do that evening I went
					around to miss sheer's house and knocked on the door and waited for her to answer it when she opened
					the door she was holding a mug of tea and she was wearing sheepskin slippers and she had been
					watching a quiz program on the television because there was a television on and I could hear someone
					saying the capital city of Venezuela is a Maracas B Caracas C Bogota Bogota or D Georgetown and I
					knew that it was Caracas she said Christopher I really don't think I want to see you right now I
					said I didn't kill Wellington and she replied what are you doing here I said I wanted to come and
					tell you that I didn't kill Wellington and I also want to find out who killed him some of her tea
					spilled onto the carpet I said do you know who killed Wellington she didn't answer my question she
					just said goodbye Christopher and close the door then I decided to do some detective work I could
					see that she was watching me and waiting for me to leave because I could see her standing in her
					Hall on the other side of the frosted glass and her front door so I walked on the path and out of
					the garden then I turned around and saw that she wasn't standing in her Hall any longer I made sure
					that there was no one watching and climbed over the wall and walked down the side of the house into
					her back Garden to the shed where she kept all of her gardening tools the shed was locked with a
					padlock and I couldn't go inside so I walked around to the window in the side then I had some good
					luck when I looked through the window I could see a fork that looked exactly the same as the fork
					that it had been sticking out of Wellington it was lying by the bench by the window and it had been
					cleaned because there was no blood on the spikes I could see some other tools as well a spade and a
					rake and one of those lawn clippers people use for cutting branches which are too high to reach and
					they all had the same green plastic handles like the fork this meant that the fork belonged to Mrs
					shears either that or it was a red herring which is a clue which makes you come to the wrong
					conclusion or something which looks like a clue but is not I wondered if Mrs shears had killed
					Wellington herself but if she had killed Wellington herself why had she come out of the house
					shouting what in fox name have you done to my dog I thought that Mrs shears probably didn't kill
					Wellington but whoever had killed him had probably killed him with Mrs Shear's forks and the shed
					was locked this meant that it was someone who had the keys to Mrs Shear's shed or that she had left
					it unlocked or that she had left her fork lying around in the garden I heard a noise and turned
					around and saw Miss shears standing on the lawn looking at me I said I came to see if the fork was
					in the shed and she said if you don't go now I will call the police again so I went home when I got
					home I said hello to father and went upstairs and fed Toby my rat and felt happy because I was being
					a detective and finding things out alright guys we'll end it there for today I hope you guys enjoyed
					this next part in this series we're getting some good input guys foreign
