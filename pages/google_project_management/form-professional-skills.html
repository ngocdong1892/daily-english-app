				<p id="1cf468a0-53d4-81f5-a462-c54d5e9e06a9" class="">Now let’s define what a project manager is and
					describe how they add value to their teams and organizations.<br />Let’s start with a
					definition.<br />Project managers shepherd projects from start to finish and serve /sɜːrv/ as guides
					for
					their team using their impeccable /ɪmˈpekəbl/ organizational /ˌɔːrɡənəˈzeɪʃənl and interpersonal
					/ˌɪntərˈpɜːrsənl/ skills every step of the way.<br />As you learned earlier, project managers
					usually
					follow a process that involves planning and organizing, managing tasks, budgeting, and controlling
					costs
					so that the project can be completed within the approved time frame.<br />We’ll dig deeper into
					these
					topics throughout /θruːˈaʊt/ this program.<br />What you need to know right now is that project
					managers
					play a crucial role in their organizations.<br />Project managers add value to their teams and
					organizations in key ways that include prioritization /praɪˌɔːrətəˈzeɪʃn/, delegation /ˌdelɪˈɡeɪʃn/,
					and
					effective communication.<br />So let’s break these down.<br />First, we’ll discuss prioritization
					/praɪˌɔːrətəˈzeɪʃn/.<br />Project managers add value to their teams and organizations through
					effective
					prioritization /praɪˌɔːrətəˈzeɪʃn/ of tasks required to complete a project.<br />They’re experts at
					helping team members identify and break down large tasks into smaller steps.<br />There will be
					times
					when a project manager may not know which tasks to prioritize /praɪˈɔːrətaɪz/.<br />To determine
					/dɪˈtɜːrmɪn/ which ones are the most critical /ˈkrɪtɪkl/ to the success of the project, they’ll
					connect
					with their teams and with stakeholders to gather information and make a plan.<br />Stakeholders are
					people who are interested in and affected by the project’s completion and success, like the leader
					of an
					organization.<br />You’ve probably used prioritization to complete work in the past.<br />In any
					kind of
					project, personal or professional, there are tasks with different levels of priority.<br />For
					example,
					let’s imagine that you’ve decided to rent a house and plan to repaint /ˌriːˈpeɪnt/ the
					rooms.<br />You’ve picked out your paint, and you’re eager to get started.<br />While it may be
					tempting
					to start painting right away, you’ll need to prioritize tasks like laying out drop cloths to protect
					the
					floors and furniture, applying blue tape to the room’s edges, and much more.<br />Those preliminary
					/prɪˈlɪmɪneri/ steps are critical and need to come before painting /ˈpeɪntɪŋ/.<br />Other related
					steps
					like choosing new face plates for your light switches can come later in the process or be switched
					out
					of the project entirely /ɪnˈtaɪərli/ if you run out of time or money.<br />But when you choose to
					take
					care of these preliminary /prɪˈlɪmɪneri/ steps before wedging open the paint can, you’re
					prioritizing
					/praɪˈɔːrətaɪz/ the tasks or steps of your project.<br />You’re also increasing /ɪnˈkriːs/ the
					likelihood /ˈlaɪklihʊd/ that you’ll be satisfied /ˈsætɪsfaɪd/ with your newly painted
					rooms.<br />This
					process is similar for professional projects.<br />When you effectively prioritize /praɪˈɔːrətaɪz/
					important tasks, you set up your team and yourself for a better project outcome.<br />Now let’s
					discuss
					delegation /ˌdelɪˈɡeɪʃn/.<br />Project managers use delegation to add value to their teams and
					organizations by matching tasks to individuals who can best complete the work.<br />Let’s return to
					our
					house-painting example for a second here.<br />Painting multiple rooms can be a time-consuming
					/kənˈsuːmɪŋ/ project.<br />So it’s possible that you might enlist /ɪnˈlɪst/ a few friends to help
					you
					get it done.<br />Maybe one friend has professional painting experience.<br />Now, with that in
					mind,
					you might ask her to handle the more challenging /ˈtʃælɪndʒɪŋ/ aspects of the project like painting
					the
					ceiling /ˈsiːlɪŋ/ or the detailed molding /ˈməʊldɪŋ/.<br />You might also schedule her to paint the
					molding /ˈməʊldɪŋ/ before another friend paints the walls.<br />So by delegating this task to the
					person
					with the right skills to complete the work and ordering the tasks appropriately /əˈprəʊpriətli/,
					you’re
					applying knowledge of your team’s strengths to the planning of your project.<br />That makes sense,
					right?<br />Finally, let’s talk about effective communication.<br />Project managers deliver value
					through effective communication, both with their team and with key stakeholders.<br />This refers to
					being transparent /trænsˈpærənt/, which means being upfront /ˌʌpˈfrʌnt/ with plans and ideas and
					making
					information readily available.<br />Project managers keep in regular contact with their team about
					the
					progress of the work and help identify areas where a teammate /ˈtiːmmeɪt/ may need support.<br />In
					our
					house-painting example, this might involve checking in with your friends periodically
					/ˌpɪriˈɑːdɪkli/ to
					ask if they have enough paint or supplies left to complete their tasks.<br />Checking in regularly
					means
					you’ll know if you need to buy more paint before the can is empty, which ensures that the project
					stays
					on track.<br />In addition to keeping up with teammates /ˈtiːmmeɪt/, project managers keep in
					regular
					contact with people outside of the team, like company leaders who are invested /ɪnˈvest/ in the
					project
					outcomes.<br />For example, you might reach out to your landlord /ˈlændlɔːrd to get permission to
					paint
					and to share the days you’ll be working on this project.<br />Though your landlord /ˈlændlɔːrd isn’t
					directly involved in the project’s execution, the outcomes will affect her property.<br />And so
					it’s
					important to keep her informed.<br />Without your project management skills, you might run out of
					paint
					halfway through the project, your walls might get painted without drop cloths to protect the floors,
					and
					your landlord /ˈlændlɔːrd could be caught off guard /ɡɑːrd/ about your plans.<br />So it’s a good
					thing
					you’re here to keep the project running smoothly and efficiently /ɪˈfɪʃntli/.<br />Great, now you
					should
					be able to define what a project manager is and explain how they use prioritization
					/praɪˌɔːrətəˈzeɪʃn/,
					delegation /ˌdelɪˈɡeɪʃn/, and effective communication to deliver value to their
					organizations.<br />Coming up, you’ll hear about the career path of a real-life project manager at
					Google.<br />Their journey, to me, is fascinating /ˈfæsɪneɪtɪŋ/.<br />And we can’t wait to share it
					with
					you.<br /></p>

				<p id="1cf468a0-53d4-80ac-b190-defa1b056b4e" class="">You learned that project management is the
					application
					of knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to meet the project requirements and achieve the desired
					/dɪˈzaɪər/ outcome.<br />So how does that actually happen?<br />Well, that’s where you come
					in.<br />Project managers usually follow a process that involves planning and organizing, managing
					tasks, budgeting, and controlling costs, and other factors so that the project can be completed
					within
					the approved budget and time frame.<br />Let’s break these down into examples of responsibilities
					/rɪˌspɑːnsəˈbɪləti/ that you might find in a job listing for a project management role.<br />We’ll
					start
					with planning and organizing.<br />One responsibility /rɪˌspɑːnsəˈbɪləti/ that falls under the
					umbrella
					of planning and organizing is making use of productivity tools and creating processes
					/ˈprɑːses/.<br />During the planning and execution of a project, you might need to use certain tools
					and
					develop processes to improve information-sharing across the team.<br />You may also need to create
					plans, timelines, schedules, and other forms of documentation to track project completion.<br />And
					you’ll usually need to maintain those documents throughout the entirety /ɪnˈtaɪərəti/ of the
					project.<br />The next task is budgeting and controlling costs and other factors.<br />As the
					project is
					underway /ˌʌndərˈweɪ/, changes to the plan and budget are bound /baʊnd/ to come up, believe
					me.<br />This will require you to monitor and manage the budget, track issues, and risks as they
					arise
					/əˈraɪz/, and manage quality by mitigating /ˈmɪtɪɡeɪtɪŋ/ those issues and risks.<br />One way to do
					this
					is by removing unforeseen /ˌʌnfɔːrˈsiːn/ barriers that come up.<br />Now, by barriers /ˈbæriər/, we
					mean
					things that can get in the way of project progress.<br />For example, if your teammates /ˈtiːmmeɪt/
					lack
					the resources needed to complete a task, you might identify that issue or barrier up
					front.<br />Escalate /ˈeskəleɪt/ the issue to a stakeholder, and work to secure the resource so your
					team can move forward.<br />Another huge piece of the project manager’s role is managing
					tasks.<br />A
					project task is an activity that needs to be accomplished /əˈkɑːmplɪʃt/ within a set period of time
					by
					you, your team, or your stakeholders.<br />Keeping track of tasks is a great way to help manage the
					team’s workload and ensure that things are getting done.<br />Keeping track of tasks is also a great
					tool for demonstrating /ˈdemənstreɪt/ progress to people outside the immediate /ɪˈmiːdiət/ team like
					your stakeholders.<br />Back when I was a program manager in student development here at Google, one
					of
					our goals was to create pathways for students who identify with communities /kəˈmjuːnət̬iz/ that are
					underrepresented /ˌʌndər ˌreprɪˈzentɪd/ in the technology industry.<br />A large part of my
					day-to-day
					responsibilities /rɪˌspɑːnsəˈbɪləti/ involved working with two separate /ˈseprət/ engineering teams
					to
					create our technical curriculum /kəˈrɪkjələm/.<br />To manage the tasks associated /əˈsəʊʃieɪtɪd/
					with
					this project, I created separate project trackers for each team that outlined the vision for the
					curriculum /kəˈrɪkjələm/.<br />These trackers kept both teams in the loop about the timeline for
					delivery, the categories and subcategories for work, and the team members assigned to each
					task.<br />I
					also made sure to update our stakeholders every step of the way.<br />By actively managing tasks
					throughout the project lifecycle, I was able to keep tabs on everyone’s work and efficiently inform
					stakeholders, which allowed us to achieve our project goal with minimal issues.<br /><br /></p>
				<p id="1cf468a0-53d4-80a8-b0e2-c09053a20633" class="">Let’s discuss the role of the project manager and
					how
					that role relates to other roles within the project team.<br />It’s easier to hear the term manager
					and
					immediately think of your boss.<br />But a project manager is not often the direct manager of the
					people
					working on a project team.<br />Here, we’re discussing the project manager as someone who manages
					the
					tasks of a project.<br />But what does that really mean, right?<br />Well, although you might have a
					few
					teammates /ˈtiːmmeɪt/ working with you on a project, you’re probably not their day-to-day
					boss.<br />With the help of your team, you can get a lot more done together.<br />Everyone on your
					team
					will have their own set of roles and responsibilities /rɪˌspɑːnsəˈbɪləti/.<br />And you’ll come
					together
					to ensure that everyone is able to do their part to advance the project.<br />Each person will be an
					expert on their portion /ˈpɔːrʃn/ of the project, but no one will be an expert on every aspect
					/ˈæspekt/
					of the project.<br />And honestly, neither will you.<br />For instance /ˈɪnstəns/, the graphic
					designer
					will focus on graphic design but probably won’t be an expert on copyrighting.<br />Similarly, you’ll
					be
					an expert on project management but may not be an expert on marketing.<br />Here’s another way to
					think
					about it.<br />Imagine that you’re organizing a camping trip.<br />You might be the person in charge
					of
					planning the trip, but that doesn’t mean you have to be a camping expert.<br />Maybe you’ve never
					been
					camping before, but your partner grew up spending every summer by the campfire /ˈkæmpfaɪər/.<br />In
					that case, you might assign them the task of picking out the right number and style of tents for
					your
					group.<br />So in this example, you are planning the trip by giving your partner the job of finding
					the
					right number of tents and the right size tents to make sure everyone’s covered.<br />You aren’t
					doing
					the research or the task yourself.<br />But you’re making sure that things are getting
					done.<br />It’s
					similar in the workplace /ˈwɜːrkpleɪs/.<br />As the project manager, you won’t be an expert in every
					project role.<br />And that’s OK.<br />As we said, your job isn’t to be the expert on
					everything.<br />Instead, you’re responsible for guiding your team and making sure that they have
					the
					support that they need in order to complete the project.<br />So how does a project manager go about
					doing that?<br />Let’s discuss using a few more examples of the required responsibilities
					/rɪˌspɑːnsəˈbɪləti/ you might find in a job listing.<br />First, you’ll need to hold all team
					members
					accountable /əˈkaʊntəbl/ for their assigned tasks.<br />Managing tasks will help you hold your team
					members accountable /əˈkaʊntəbl/ by giving them ownership over specific pieces of the
					project.<br />Second, you’ll need to ensure that issues and risks are tracked and visible and be
					able to
					establish /ɪˈstæblɪʃ/ escalation /ˌeskəˈleɪʃn/ paths.<br />Now, by escalation /ˌeskəˈleɪʃn/ paths, I
					mean that you should know how you’ll communicate risks to the right people at the right
					time.<br />Third, you’ll need to understand and help teammates adopt the right workflows and project
					management styles.<br />As the project manager, you’ll likely have the best idea of which style is
					best
					for the work.<br />It’s your job to ensure that the team adheres /ədˈhɪr/ to that style and the
					other
					systems in place.<br />And fourth, you’ll need to collaborate /kəˈlæbəreɪt/ with other teams at the
					organization to meet the requirements based on project, scope, schedule, and budget.<br />In other
					words, a project may affect not only your team, but other teams at an organization, as well, let’s
					say,
					the marketing or the finance/ˈfaɪnæns/ team.<br />So you’ll need to work with those teams to ensure
					that
					everyone is happy with the project outcomes.<br />You’ll learn more about working with other
					stakeholders in a later course.<br />Catch all that?<br />Let’s recap.<br />You’ve learned that a
					project manager isn’t always the direct manager of each member of the project team.<br />Rather,
					they’re
					responsible for guiding those people and ensuring they have the support they need to complete the
					project.<br /><br /></p>
				<p id="1cf468a0-53d4-806c-b738-f1e6d6e00886" class="">While there are lots of different skills a project
					manager can bring to their role, there are four specific skill sets that we think can help a project
					manager be successful.<br />Those are enabling decision making, communicating and escalating
					/ˈeskəleɪt/, flexibility /ˌfleksəˈbɪləti/, and strong organizational skills.<br />First, let’s talk
					about enabling /ɪˈneɪblɪŋ/ decision making.<br />The ability to enable decision making on the team
					or
					gathering /ˈɡæðərɪŋ/ decisions from the appropriate /əˈprəʊpriət/ leader is crucial to keep projects
					on
					task and achieve their goals.<br />Lots of the day-to-day decisions within the project will likely
					fall
					to you and your teammates /ˈtiːmmeɪt/ to discuss and agree on.<br />You’ll ensure that projects stay
					on
					schedule by gathering information from teammates teammates and using those insights /ˈɪnsaɪt/ to
					help
					the team make informed decisions.<br />You’ll also make sure that those decisions are communicated
					to
					the necessary coworkers /ˈkəʊ wɜːrkər/, whether that’s the immediate /ɪˈmiːdiət/ team or company
					leaders.<br />For example, you might provide relevant /ˈreləvənt/ data or feedback to help your
					teammates make an informed decision between choice A and choice B. The second skill is communicating
					and
					escalating /ˈeskəleɪt/.<br />As a project manager, you’ll use your communication skills in just
					about
					everything you do.<br />This might look like documenting plans, sending emails about the status of
					the
					project, or holding a meeting to escalate /ˈeskəleɪt/ risks or issues to stakeholders.<br />The
					third
					skill is flexibility /ˌfleksəˈbɪləti/.<br />As a project manager, knowing how to be flexible
					/ˈfleksəbl/
					when changes are needed is key.<br />Plans definitively /dɪˈfɪnətɪvli/ will change, even with
					careful
					upfront /ˌʌpˈfrʌnt/ planning.<br />For example, maybe the goals of your company change.<br />Or
					maybe a
					member of your team unexpectedly /ˌʌnɪkˈspektɪdli/ takes a new position at another company.<br />A
					good
					project manager knows that unpredictable /ˌʌnprɪˈdɪktəbl/ moments like these are almost always
					guaranteed /ˌɡærənˈtiː/.<br />A quote we love here at Google is, “The only constant is change.” And
					that’s true.<br />By staying cool under pressure /ˈpreʃər/, you’ll be able to adjust while helping
					your
					team stay calm, too.<br />And finally, a successful project manager needs strong organizational
					skills.<br />As you learned earlier, the role of a project manager requires using a lot of different
					processes to keep the project on track.<br />Having strong organizational skills means having the
					ability to organize these processes and the core elements of a project to ensure nothing gets lost
					or
					overlooked /ˌəʊvərˈlʊk/, which, trust me, can and does happen.<br />To prevent this, you might
					decide to
					track daily tasks in a spreadsheet /ˈspredʃiːt/ or send frequent status updates or
					reminders.<br />There
					are many ways to stay organized and hone your organizational skills.<br />And we’ll talk more about
					them
					throughout the program.<br />To recap, decision making, communicating and escalating /ˈeskəleɪt/,
					flexibility /ˌfleksəˈbɪləti/, and strong organizational skills are four core skill sets that are
					essential /ɪˈsenʃl/ to successful project management.<br />You can continue to build on these skills
					by
					becoming familiar with industry knowledge that applies to most project management
					roles.<br />Knowledge
					of helpful tools and templates and familiarity /fəˌmɪliˈærəti/ with popular project management
					styles
					like waterfall and agile can help you organize and document the project throughout its
					lifecycle.<br />We’ll learn about these throughout this program.<br />Hopefully, you feel better
					equipped to explain the core skills a project manager should bring to the role.<br />These skills
					really
					help enforce /ɪnˈfɔːrs/ team morale and accountability /əˌkaʊntəˈbɪləti/ for the tasks of a
					project.<br />We’ll discuss this coming up.<br /><br />Earlier, you learned about the role of the
					project manager and the core skills you’ll need to be successful in that role.<br />You’ve also
					learned
					more about your role within the project team.<br />Now let’s discuss a few key skills that you’ll
					use to
					build relationships with your teammates /ˈtiːmmeɪt/ and stakeholders.<br />Using your interpersonal
					/ˌɪntərˈpɜːrsənl/ skills is key to building relationships with the people involved in your
					project.<br />By developing these relationships, you’ll learn about the needs and concerns of the
					team.<br />This will help you determine /dɪˈtɜːrmɪn/ the priorities of the project and motivate
					/ˈməʊtɪveɪt/ your team throughout the process.<br />Possessing strong interpersonal
					/ˌɪntərˈpɜːrsənl/
					skills is a huge part of good leadership.<br />Even if you’ve never held a formal leadership
					position,
					having these skills will help you when you need to guide a team.<br />This is called influencing
					/ˈɪnfluəns/ without authority /əˈθɔːrəti/, which refers to a project manager’s ability to guide
					teammates /ˈtiːmmeɪt/ to complete their assigned work without acting as their direct
					managers.<br />There’s a few key interpersonal /ˌɪntərˈpɜːrsənl/ skills that you can use to
					accomplish
					/əˈkɑːmplɪʃ/ this and guide the project outcomes, even without the authority /əˈθɔːrəti/ of being
					your
					teammates’ boss.<br />These skills include communication, negotiation /nɪˌɡəʊʃiˈeɪʃn/, conflict
					mediation /ˌmiːdiˈeɪʃn/, and understanding motivations.<br />So let’s break these down.<br />First
					up is
					a key skill we’ve mentioned /əˌbʌv ˈmenʃnd/ a few times now, communication.<br />In the context of
					leading a team, communication can include checking in with teammates /ˈtiːmmeɪt/ to understand how
					they’re progressing on a task and providing clear feedback on the quality of a teammate’s
					work.<br />Next is negotiation /nɪˌɡəʊʃiˈeɪʃn/.<br />Negotiation might include working with a
					teammate
					/ˈtiːmmeɪt/ to compromise /ˈkɑːmprəmaɪz/ on a new deadline when they tell you that they won’t be
					able to
					complete their work on time.<br />Now, trust me, I know this can be frustrating
					/ˈfrʌstreɪtɪŋ/.<br />But
					you’ll need to use your negotiation skills often with your teammates and stakeholders to balance
					their
					needs and what is best for the project.<br />Another important skill is conflict mediation
					/ˌmiːdiˈeɪʃn/.<br />As we mentioned /ˌmiːdiˈeɪʃn/, project plans can change and issues will arise
					/əˈraɪz/.<br />This can sometimes lead to tension and conflict within the team.<br />So conflict
					mediation /ˌmiːdiˈeɪʃn/ is a great skill to practice and develop to ensure the project does not
					suffer
					/ˈsʌfər/ as a result. This might involve setting up a meeting with two teammates who are struggling
					/ˈstrʌɡl/ to agree upon the best way to handle a shared task.<br />And finally, there’s
					understanding
					motivations.<br />This means getting to know your teammates and figuring /ˈfɪɡjər/ out what pushes
					/pʊʃ/
					them to do their best work.<br />Understanding motivations might also include learning how your
					teammates prefer to receive feedback and how they like to receive recognition /ˌrekəɡˈnɪʃn/ for
					doing a
					great job.<br />You would use that individualized /ˌɪndɪˈvɪdʒuəlaɪzd/ information to motivate and
					encourage /ɪnˈkɜːrɪdʒ/ each person on your team.<br />So to recap– communication, negotiation
					/nɪˌɡəʊʃiˈeɪʃn/, conflict mediation, and understanding motivations are all interpersonal
					/ˌɪntərˈpɜːrsənl/ skills that will help you influence /ˈɪnfluəns/ without authority
					/əˈθɔːrəti/.<br />
				</p>
				<p id="1cf468a0-53d4-80e4-bd67-d024019f2f8b" class=""><br />During job interviews for project management
					positions, you might be asked to discuss a time when you influenced /ˈɪnfluəns/ without authority
					/əˈθɔːrəti/.<br />And it’s possible that you’ve already noticed ways that you’ve used these skills
					in
					your personal life without even realizing it.<br />For example, let’s say you have a coworker /ˈkəʊ
					wɜːrkər/ who’s constantly /ˈkɑːnstəntli/ late to every meeting, and I mean every meeting.<br />While
					you
					can’t force them to arrive on time, it’s likely that you’ve thought about ways to motivate them to
					want
					to be on time.<br />In doing so, you might have also wondered how to change the way you communicate
					with
					your coworker to influence /ˈɪnfluəns/ them to be on time.<br />Maybe you’ve tried asking them to
					arrive
					15 minutes earlier than the rest of the group.<br />Or maybe you’ve told them how this behavior
					/bɪˈheɪvjər/ impacts the rest of the team.<br />Both of these strategies /ˈstrætədʒi/ are examples
					of
					influencing /ˈɪnfluəns/ without authority /əˈθɔːrəti/, and they serve to encourage /ɪnˈkɜːrɪdʒ/
					specific
					behavior.<br />Influencing /ˈɪnfluəns/ without authority /əˈθɔːrəti/ is one of the most critical
					/ˈkrɪtɪkl/ and one of the most challenging /ˈtʃælɪndʒɪŋ/ aspects of project management.<br />As
					you’ve
					just learned, you’ll need to leverage your interpersonal /ˌɪntərˈpɜːrsənl/ skills in order to do it
					effectively /ɪˈfektɪvli/.<br /><br />ROWENA: Congratulations /kənˌɡrætʃ·əˈleɪ·ʃənz/ on finishing
