					vocabulary he um so you go up in the end thank you so much bye bye okay Orlando thank you Orlando
					thank you muchas gracias thank you for sending me that video thank you for taking the time to film
					it for me I really appreciate that and I think I think it's great that you are learning English
					Orlando okay keep on going keep on going and one day you'll reach your goal thank you Orlando so
					today I am going to talk about what I think is one of the most important things that you can do in
					your life to make your life better okay one of the best investments in versions of time and money
					that you can do okay reading reading okay I think the reading is one of the most important things
					you could do to improve your life so today if you want to improve your life go to the library go to
					the bookstore okay and get three good books get three good books get three good books and read those
					and your life will be better your life will be better after you're done with them so books are very
					important okay when you read when you read you grow okay you grow your mind Grows All right you
					absorb new ideas all right you learn new words okay new opinions you can learn about how successful
					people Persona sexy tells us how they became successful okay and then you can start to use those
					things in your life so there's two different kinds of books okay there's fiction and non-fiction so
					non-fiction is a book about something that actually happened okay it's true it's a book about
					somebody's life it's a book about history it's a book about science okay those are non-fiction now
					fiction is just a good story okay it's a story that is not real all right so if you want to learn
					something you read non-fiction all right but fiction can be important too all right you can still
					learn a lot from fiction so with fiction you can have an adventure okay Ventura okay you have an
					adventure without even leaving your house and you could learn new words too because authors
					authorities they like to use big words so that they sound smart reading reading is like going to the
					gym I'm not sure for your brain so I am always reading okay I'm always reading a new book lately I
					have been reading a lot okay I've been reading about a book every week so I am learning so much new
					information okay every day I'm reading uh reading a book I'm learning new information I'm learning
					new ideas okay new ideas that I could use to make my life better I read in Spanish okay when I read
					in Spanish I'm improving my Spanish and I'm learning new interesting ideas so for you guys you guys
					who have a intermediate level of English I think that you guys should be reading in English Okay I
					think that you should be reading easy books in English all right because you will learn a lot of new
					words you'll learn a lot of new words and you'll be seeing how we use the language all right so for
					example the first book the first book that I ever read in Spanish was this one okay but in English
					it's called the Archer now this this is a really good book but it's also very easy okay there's
					there's drawings in it the Bluehost so you got drawings and then a little bit of reading drawing and
					some reading okay but this is really easy book to read okay it was really easy so maybe you guys
					could read the archer in English but once I started once I started to read in Spanish my Spanish
					really improved a lot okay because I was consuming consumiendo I was consuming the language so one
					of my favorite books ever that I want to talk about The Count of Monte Cristo okay the count of
					money Crystal this book is fiction but it's one of the great books in my opinion okay this is a book
					about revenge venganza okay this is a great book and one of my favorite books but it is not an easy
					book okay very hard I probably could not read this in Spanish the book that I am reading right now
					hombre maserico de Babylonia okay the richest man in Babylon this is a book about how to make money
					how to save money okay how to be better with your money I'm reading in Spanish and I am learning a
					lot of new vocabulary and I'm also learning a lot of great ideas a lot of great ideas about how I
					can be better with my money because that's something that I'm trying to improve in my life right now
					an author Uno tour that I have read a lot of in the past Dean Coons okay I think I've probably read
					like 40 corenta Dean Koons books okay now his books are kind of uh Supernatural okay but I think
					he's a really good author I like the way that he writes I learned a lot of new words in English Okay
					reading Dean Coons because he uses big words so I really like in well in the past I really liked to
					read Dean Koons but now I like to read non-fiction okay because I'm trying to grow trying to grow as
					a person and improve my life so I don't read a lot of fiction anymore now I want to tell you guys
					about the book that has been the most important in my life okay this book right here Think and Grow
					Rich this is an amazing book and if you have a goal in your life I think that you should read this
					book all right one day one day I'm gonna make a whole video about this book after I reach my goal
					okay but for right now I will say this is an amazing book it has changed a lot of lives and it can
					change your life too so I think that you guys should be reading every day alright and you should try
					to read a lot in English okay because when I started reading in Spanish my Spanish got so much
					better so I know it can help you guys too okay So reading is one of the best things that you can do
					to improve your life it is an investment of time and money that I think you guys should make in
