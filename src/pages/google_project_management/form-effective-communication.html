					who
					connects your team to the information they need.<br />Throughout the project, you’ll serve as the
					main
					resource for your team when it comes to communicating and clarifying goals, action items, progress,
					and
					updates.<br />It’s important to make sure that you’re carrying information forward consistently and
					coherently so that everyone understands what the current state of the project is and what happens
					next.<br />Teams communicate in a myriad of ways.<br />Though project managers are constantly
					communicating through check-ins and meetings, project documents, such as project plans, including
					schedules, trackers, or meeting notes, they’re also hubs for team communication.<br />It’s your
					responsibility to be clear about how those documents get used, who has access to those documents,
					and
					how often the documents get updated.<br />Of course, in addition to those responsibilities, you’ll
					also
					have to field emails, instant messages, and attend meetings.<br />All of these things are critical
					in
					driving a project forward.<br />As a project manager, you are the one who coordinates incoming and
					outgoing information.<br />You connect individuals to the necessary details and context, and track
					who
					needs to receive what information and when.<br />You’ll need to communicate certain information to
					your
					team multiple times and in various ways.<br />Some people learn by listening.<br />Some people learn
					by
					watching, and others learn by doing.<br />Communicating in various ways ensures that you’re sharing
					knowledge to your team in a format that’s digestible and easy for them to take in.<br />Your team
					will
					have a lot of tasks to focus on.<br />Be proactive and reinforce important information multiple
					times in
					multiple ways so that no one is left out of the loop.<br />There are many tools for communicating
					with
					your team to make it easy to keep in contact and be on the same page throughout the duration of the
					project.<br />Some of these include email and messaging, in-person meetings, video conferencing, and
					work management and collaboration tools.<br />Your organization might have some of these tools in
					place
					already, or you might have the opportunity to select some for a project.<br />In either case, it’s
					good
					to be familiar with what’s out there.<br />Let’s start with messaging and email.<br />Email is
					standard
					for business communications, so it’s important to streamline the number of emails that you send
					out.<br />At Google, I get tons of emails a day.<br />It’s a lot of work to figure out which ones I
					need
					to read immediately, which ones can wait, and which ones require a reply right away.<br />It’s
					important
					that you understand how to use email in a professional context.<br />A quick internet search will
					provide you with lots of tips and examples.<br />Here are some of my key tips for you to keep in
					mind–
					carefully select who you’re sending an email to, and most importantly, be conscious of why you’re
					sending it.<br />Make sure the subject field clearly states what the email is about.<br />If it’s
					urgent
					or requires a response, add that to the subject and the first line of the email.<br />Keep your
					messages
					as short as possible and stay on topic.<br />If there’s a lot of information to share, consider
					placing
					the information into a digital document you can link or attach to the email.<br />Then summarize
					what
					you want readers to focus on.<br />If there’s a specific action you need from the recipient, state
					it
					clearly so that they understand what’s expected of them and when.<br />Your language choices
					matter.<br />So avoid slang, acronyms, and shortcuts for words that might be more appropriate for
					texts.<br />Oh, and one more thing– write in an appropriate tone for the person receiving the
					email.<br />It’s generally best practice to be friendly, motivating, clear, and specific.<br />As I
					mentioned earlier, most people, especially other managers, directors, and executive get lots of
					emails.<br />With that in mind, you may want to consider instant messaging tools like Google Meet or
					Slack.<br />This can be an alternative to email when you just have a quick question or update, or as
					a
					way to alert someone to please check their inbox.<br />Instant messaging helps reduce back and forth
					emails or phone calls, and can quickly clear up miscommunications, or let you know if and when you
					should take an issue to a meeting.<br />Be mindful of when you decide to use instant
					messaging.<br />This kind of quick communication can lead to distraction and informality.<br />It
					can
					easily become an outlet to share non-work-related information or information that’s sensitive or
					confidential.<br />It can also be difficult to track instant messages.<br />Later on, if you need to
					reference information that you chatted about, you might not be able to easily find it with instant
					messaging.<br />It’s a good idea to ask people’s preferences on how they like to be communicated
					with.<br />Even if instant messaging is faster, the person might prefer to use email.<br />With
					experience, you’ll be able to determine the most effective ways to communicate with your
					team.<br />Next
					up, we’ll discuss some tools for remote meetings.<br />Virtual meeting tools like Google Meet and
					Zoom
					are great for communicating, especially as remote work becomes more standard.<br />Better yet, each
					of
					these tools are easy to access and easy to learn how to use.<br />Well-run online meetings can be
					extremely effective.<br />They allow you and your team to interact in real time, which can help
					boost
					morale and create a sense of team when it’s not possible to be together in person.<br />Virtual
					meetings
					can be highly engaging as attendees can access and share files during the meeting.<br />And then
					there
					are work management and collaboration tools like Google Drive, Asana, and SmartSheet.<br />These
					kinds
					of tools make it easier to share information among teams.<br />Even better, with work management and
					collaboration tools, information sharing goes both ways.<br />Team members can easily update their
					progress without the need for extra meetings or phone calls.<br />These tools can accomplish many
					different things, like tracking progress on tasks, deliverables, and milestones.<br />They can also
					help
					you to manage a budget, build helpful charts and diagrams, manage contracts and licenses, and keep
					stakeholders informed.<br />Work management and collaboration tools allow you to focus your
					communications within the context of specific tasks, project details, and timelines.<br />Rather
					than
					writing an email and linking to the relevant information, when you’re working and communicating in a
					tool, the information is already there in one place for easy reference and
					decision-making.<br />Another
					great aspect of these kinds of tools is that the work gets done in real time.<br />These tools allow
					remote teams to collaborate and communicate as though they’re physically working in the same office
					together.<br />Encouraging your teams to check in and update their progress regularly helps to
					maintain
					the real-time feel of interacting with coworkers.<br />There are many different types of work
					management
					software that automatically make project planning and tracking a lot easier.<br />And they are much
					more
					efficient than manual project tracking.<br />A quick word of caution before we move on– the use
					access
					or sharing of confidential or need-to-know information externally, including financial and business
					data, user data, and information about our products and services is likely prohibited unless you’re
					given explicit permission.<br />When using shared work management tools, just be mindful of who
					wants
					and needs access versus who doesn’t need access to do your part in keeping important data
					safe.<br />There are so many different ways to share information to your team, whether through
					meetings,
					emails, instant messages, spreadsheets, and trackers.<br />By becoming familiar with some of the
					more
					common communication tools, you can choose the right one for your project needs.<br />[MUSIC
