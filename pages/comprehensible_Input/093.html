					you to practice your English today yeah thanks me too okay so to start can you can you tell me a
					little bit about yourself how old you are where you're from well my name is Adrian Chavez and I am
					26 years old and I am from Venezuela but I moved to to Chile about six years ago and I'm living
					right now in a city in the suit of Chile called conception I'm living with a friend Miguel Luis
					Miguel and I moved here because of my girlfriend she is from from Chile and my family lives in
					Santiago Chile okay and uh how long have you been learning English well I learned in English about I
					started this journey about three years ago and I just started doing income input compressible even
					when I don't I don't have I don't really know what is that and I I was just seeing TV shows and I
					want to I wanted to to learn and I wanted to to know and you know to know what the actor said
					without subtitles and I started doing this with subtitles in English and I I realized that I can I I
					was able to understand so I was feeling very good and I started to do like a schedule and I and I
					delete that in four parts listening writing reading and and speaking and and I used to do it like
					three months but really focus um and I have to say that I learn a lot but I I I don't do that like a
					lot of time just for some months and then I I stopped to study okay okay well uh you're doing really
					well I think you obviously have a large vocabulary you understand well you know a lot of words just
					a little nervous when you speak still right yeah yeah yeah I I think that I have a lot of of passive
					vocabulary because I can understand a lot of words in English I I really can understand whatever
					that you say unless that is a topic that I I don't know but I can understand a lot but when I have
					to speak I don't feel able to do that I don't have enough confidence okay well maybe after today
					you'll feel a little bit better yeah yeah I think so so uh three years ago when you started learning
					English what was it that made you want to learn English why what is it in your life that you want to
					use your English for well I I have to say that I wasn't really good in English in school I was very
					bad and my father lives in the United States so he he teach me English but I don't I don't really
					learn nothing and I want to I want to make that goal just because I'm a little obsessed I'm a person
					that when have something in his mind I had to I have to do all the things that you know that I I
					achieved that goal when you have a goal there's nothing that's going to stop you right something
					like that yeah awesome okay your dad lives in the U.S so he speaks good English right yes yes he he
					was he was living in San Francisco I don't know how many years but then I I returned to to Venezuela
					have have you so you've been to the U.S no never no you haven't okay so when you come here they're
					gonna call you Adrian you know that right yeah yeah yeah okay would you like to visit the US one day
					yes yes of course I that was one of my dream but I I saying that dream because I'm a little if care
					if I visit that country and also like I am Venezuelan I don't I think that I I can visit that
					country because my passport I need other passport for for go to that country yeah it could be
					difficult it could be difficult to come from a South American country to the US I know there's a a
					lot of difficulties with the VISA process definitely okay so what do you like to do for fun in your
					free time well I I like to do a sport I I do calisthenics you hear about that yeah so like push-ups
					pull-ups things like that body weight exercises exactly there are exercises that you do with your
					own body with the weight of your body push-ups pull ups muscle ups handstand I do I do that about
					five years ago and I I am really good and I I like to I like to go with my girlfriend hiking read I
					like to read books I I really like to read books about self-improvement um and I like to learn
					things I I'm a person that really likes to to learn I like to play it says in my free time and I
					also work as a seller and in my free time I sell stink like toys um things that I know that the the
					People needs okay sound like a busy guy yes um I I like to work out as well I don't do a lot of
					calisthenics but um muscle ups are pretty hard man you could do muscle ups yes yes I can do dance
					okay all right later you have to send me some tips okay consejos of course yeah all right man cool
					so what are some things in your life that are you you are most grateful for well um I have to say
					that my my family because when my family is good I feel good if someone if someone that might like
					my people than my family don't have good health or doesn't feel good is sick I don't feel well I I
					can spend you know when I doing whatever thing I can think because my mind is in adult in another
					place I I can concentrate myself so I I am grateful for my family that's great it's great okay yeah
					and I I understand what you're saying too about uh you want to make sure your family's got
					everything they need right and if they have problems you want to help them exactly okay how old did
					you say you are I'm 26 year old okay no kids yet what you don't have children no no I don't have
					children yes my girlfriend and I and your girlfriend does she speak English as well no no she don't
					like English oh she doesn't want to No in fact I when she was in the University I spent time try to
					teach English but she's like she doesn't want to learn English but um about two weeks she started to
					do she download the app busu and she started to doing the lesson and I think that she really likes
					English but she don't feel confident just like me when I start doing this journey okay well you
					could help her a lot with her journey right you've learned a lot I'm sure I want to help her well
					good luck to your girlfriend I hope I hope she finds uh that she enjoys English and I hope that it
					goes well for her thank you okay this is one of my favorite questions that I ask in these videos
					what is your biggest fear what is my biggest fear well oh that's really complex question and I think
					that maybe my biggest fears is don't achieve my goals before my my moms and my dad dies I think that
					that's my my biggest fear and if that happens that is going to be there's going to be something
					really bad for me I don't want that I don't want that you want to become successful while your
					parents can see you be successful right yes exactly Okay so speaking of goals and success for you
					what does it mean to be successful what will it mean for you to be a successful man that's a really
					good question and I think that depends for the person that you act ask him um for me um is is not
					about money is about yourself because you can you have to you have to you need to have some goals
					about money about self-improvement and successful is Achieve all that goals but also a difficult
					they see learn English pero is Como consider Jesus is coming is pero que tengo Pokemon Sun your
					services so what is the one thing about yourself that you are most proud of well the one thing and
					maybe muscle ups 10 muscle ups but um I am very discipline Aid I have I don't know how to say that
					in English but I have volunta because as you know every person have to have to work for the money
					and is band night night hours for day for work and I don't have really free time for for doing
					exercise and I have to I have to spend time with my girlfriend and some days I wake up really early
					for have time to to practice my exercise to to do exercise to do workout and and I think that most
					of the people don't do that most of the people really just spend time sleeping and even in winter
					when you are freezing outside you have to do it because if you don't do that um you're going to
					regret and I think that that's my okay come on me okay so you're a very disciplined person that's
					great I want to tell you the word you're looking for because I think it's going to be important for
					you because uh you seem like somebody who has a lot of it and you're gonna need to talk about topics
					like this in the future so willpower Force willpower you have a lot of willpower willpower right
					thank you no problem okay let's see do you think so I wrote these questions that I'm going to ask
					you now in Spanish but you're doing so good in English I want to keep going to let you practice your
					English okay thank you right okay so do you think that you're a happy person well sometimes I'm
					really happy sometimes when I visit my parents with my girlfriend I I feel like I have everything in
					life when I around of the people that love me I feel really happy but sometimes as you may know um I
					posted families yeah you know something that I have found that maybe you also noticed in your life
					is duh kamino the the path the road of a disciplined man can be lonely sometimes yeah that's true
					because as you say not every person is going to be with you in that path so sometimes I have to do
					that alone just for myself yeah I think that's part of being a man is being able to do the things
					you don't want to do or working on your goals even if you do feel depressed even if you feel sad you
					still have to get up and do it even if it's cold outside you still got to go do your exercise you
					still have to work on your goals you still have to study and uh that could be lonely because
					probably 90 percent of people are not like that so it's too motivate yourself and that isn't easy
					yeah but I think that discipline is more important than motivation because we're not always going to
					be motivated right right you're still going to get up you're still gonna wake up and you're still
					going to go do what you have to do exactly Okay so um what are some things that you think we could
					do to be happier in life well first of all you have to know how how what are the things that make
					you happy you have to know that because if you don't know that how you are going to to be happy you
					have to know what things makes you happy and I said is okay [Music] yeah it's so important to give
					to other people and that's one of the reasons I want to be successful and one of the reasons why I
					do want money because I want to be able to help as many people as I can and if you have a lot of
					money you can change a lot of people's lives you could really make a difference that's true okay so
					you're living in uh Chile Chile right now yes but you're from Venezuela yes I am from Venezuela I
					live there um 19 years and then I move here are you happier where you are now or do you ever Miss
					Venezuela well I I have to say that I miss my country because of my friends I don't have friends
					here I just have my family and my girlfriend but all my friends are around the world I have friends
					in the United States in Argentina and in Venezuela in Spain my my best friend is right now in Spain
					and and as I said I I don't have really friends I have some friends from my job but it's not the
					same it's not the same so I miss my country for that not not for the country but for my friends so
					for the people that are still there exactly for the people I you know I I don't know everything
					about Venezuela but I've heard some bad things about the government um inflation in the economy and
					things like that is it pretty bad there with the the government and uh exactly like that is is the
					you is Universidad is Avion is capacity obsession foreign functional okay much in Chile yeah yeah no
					seven years absolutely much all right well I'm I'm happy for you that you're in a better place now
					and at least now while you're working and working towards your goals you have the possibility to
					achieve them right if you work hard yes yes okay I have to accept yeah oh you will you will man
					don't worry about that you will so how long have you been with your girlfriend um three years from
					now yeah okay what do you think that it means to love somebody well that's a difficult question um I
					think I think that you love somebody when you when you even when you are angry with her you worry
					about her um Familia [Music] yeah give them a hand you're gonna be there for them help them right
					exactly okay it is uh very cool man I agree with you I agree I think uh like you said even if you're
					angry a sign that you really love somebody is that you forgive them and you don't hold on to that
					pain you'll you'll move past it and always be there for them exactly excellent all right those were
					the the questions that I had written for you uh you said you were going to make some questions for

					have learned while you've been learning English that you would like to share with the people who are
					watching any tip or advice about learning English from your experience well you have to be very
					consistent because there's a lot of people that start something and then just don't enter it and if
					you have a goal you have to go for it you have to achieve it and so you have to do like uh apart and
					and do a step for a step to go to that goal and you don't it's not good for for you if you say oh
					I'm going I I want to learn English so I stood it today and then tomorrow just forget you have to do

					understood me well well I think that I'm very good when I am thinking in English but when I have to
					speak I don't I don't feel able I I don't I don't feel that my pronunciation is good enough but
					that's just practice as everything in life I just have to practice I have a really good memory but
					like I said before I have a lot of passive vocabulary and I can I can speak I can I can say all the
					words that I know yeah exactly yeah that's that's the way it goes though we're always going to
					understand more than we could express yes okay uh Adriana it was it was really a pleasure and an
					honor for me to share your first conversation with a native speaker I hope you enjoyed yourself
