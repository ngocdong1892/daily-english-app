					Are you ready to learn some real life English with comprehensible input? Well, good because today we
					are going to talk about something that you have to know.<br>
					You must know how to talk about when you are having conversations in English, your hobbies. Let's
					go. Hey guys, it is me, your English-speaking friend, Kyle, and today we are going to improve our
					English with comprehensible input. What is comprehensible input? Comprehensible input is when a
					native speaker like me, I'm a native English speaker, speaks to you in a slow and clear way so that
					you can understand. So today we're going to learn with comprehensible input talking about something
					that is so important when you're having conversations and meeting people in a different language.
					that is how to talk about your hobbies, your pastimes, the things that you do in your free time. And
					today I'm going to show you my hobbies. So guys, the word hobby and the word pastime, they mean the
					same thing. They are things that you like to do when you are not busy, when you are not working,
					when you are not studying. The things you like to do with your free time for fun. Okay. So you can
					see I have my guitar with me. Now guys, this is a hobby that I have had on and off for probably 18
					years. No, maybe longer, maybe 20 years. I have been playing guitar on and off now. The phrase on
					and off means that I have not been playing guitar for 20 years. No, it means I played for a year,
					then I stopped for 2 years, then I played for 2 years, then I stopped for 5 years, on and off. Okay?
					And because I've done it on and off, I'm not that good, guys. I'm really not that good. But it is a
					cool hobby. I do enjoy making music, and I think it's fun. So, I'm going to play a little piece of a
					song, and I want you guys to tell me if you know which band this is, which famous rock band from a
					long time ago.<br>
					This is, like I said, guys, I'm not very good.
					 Not very good, but I do like to play guitar. So guys, one interesting thing, interesting
					piece of vocabulary about instruments. An instrument is anything that you use to make music.
					Guitars, pianos, drums, those are instruments.
					Okay? Now in English, if somebody uses an instrument to make music, we do not say I do the guitar, I
					use the guitar.<br>
					In Spanish they use the verb to touch to carar. I touch the guitar. No, in English we say play. I
					play the guitar.
					Play the guitar.
					Play the guitar. Okay. Just an interesting piece of vocabulary. So tell me guys, do you play any
					instruments?<br>
					Okay. The next hobby is one that I am very passionate about. Okay. And that is learning languages.
					Guys, learning languages has absolutely changed my life in so many ways. And guys, because I chose
					to learn Spanish four, 5 years ago, so many great things have came into my life. Okay? I met a
					beautiful Colombian woman and I was able to speak with her because I spoke and understood Spanish.
					She became my wife, guys. Without Spanish, I would have never met my wife. If I didn't learn Spanish
					and realize how fulfilling it is to learn a language, how much I enjoy it, I would have never
					started this channel and I would have missed the opportunity that I've had to meet and speak with so
					many incredible people from all around the world. So guys, the hobby of language learning has been a
					key in my life. It has been something that makes me happy. It has been something that has brought me
					a lot of success and it is something that I want to share with you guys. So let me tell you how
					today's sponsor italkie has played a huge role in one of my favorite hobbies of language learning
					and having conversations with incredible people in the language that I'm learning. I've been using
					italki for years now. I've taken over 200 lessons with more than 80 teachers in Spanish, French, and
					Portuguese. Italki is an online platform where you can take one-on-one language lessons with real
					nativeeaking teachers from all around the world. You choose your teacher, your schedule, and your
					focus, whether it's speaking, listening, grammar, or all of the above. What I love is how flexible
					it is. If you're looking for formal classes to work on grammar, you can do that.<br>
					>> Here you see the tense. Here you see the use for the tense. And here you see the structure. So
					yeah, would you like to read the example for me, please?<br>
					>> Okay. She wakes up at 700 a.m. every day.
					>> Or if you just want pure conversation practice to get more fluent, you could do that, too.
					>> So now, how long have you been studying Spanish? When did you start studying Spanish?
					>> Well, I was 28 years old when I started.<br>
					You're not just studying the language, you're actually using it in real conversations. that helps
					improve your listening, your speaking, and gives you real time feedback from teachers who know how
					to help you grow. There are teachers for just about every language, and it's a great way to
					experience different cultures and accents without needing to travel or live overseas. It's also
					affordable, flexible, and you always pay per lesson, so you're never locked into a subscription. I
					always say that comprehensible input is the best way to start understanding a language.
					But eventually the time comes to speak.<br>
					That's where it really helps. It gives you a safe space to practice, make mistakes, and improve
					faster. And now with italki's AI tools, you can move even quicker. And there's a free trial for 1

					wait too long. Okay, guys. So, something that started out as a hobby, but is growing and growing and
					growing, it's this channel. It's this channel. And this channel is something that I am constantly
					working on, guys. Okay. So, I say that it's still a hobby, but now it's also becoming more of a
					business and it's something I'm trying to grow and grow and grow and help more people and help
					myself and my family doing something that I love. But because I actually love it, I do not call it a
					job. It's still one of my hobbies. It's still one of my pastimes. It's still something that I do for
					fun and because I truly enjoy it. So guys, pretty much every day I'm doing something that has to do
					with this YouTube channel and I'm either recording videos, well the lovely camera wife is recording
					and I'm just talking and trying to entertain you guys and teach you some English. But the thing that
					I do that I spend a ton of time doing on this channel is editing the videos. All right, guys.
					Another important feature, I spend a ton of time editing, cutting the videos. So, I cut out the
					parts where I say something wrong or I cut out the parts where the light on the camera was not very
					good.<br>
					And I try to make the whole video fun and entertaining for you guys. Now, the thing is takes a lot
					of time to do, but I really enjoy it. So, this channel is probably the thing that I spend most of my
					free time on and I do it with much pleasure. Let's talk about another hobby. All right, guys. So,
					another thing that I spend a lot of my free time on, another hobby of mine or another pastime is
					reading good books. Now, I love to read because I always love to keep on learning, growing my view
					of the world. And I think that reading is one of the best things that you can do for your brain, for
					your mental health, for your life in general. Successful people read, guys. So I usually do not read
					books that are fiction. I like non-fiction. So the difference between fiction and non-fiction, a
					fiction book is a story. Okay? It's a story like Star Wars or Lord of the Rings. It's fantasy.
					Okay? It's not real. Non-fiction will be something about history or about a great person. And I
					prefer to read books that I can learn something from. So, let me tell you about the last two books I
					just bought. I just bought these books a couple of days ago, the last time that my son and I went to
					the bookstore. So, like I said, the channel's growing.<br>
					We're getting subscribers from all around the world, and I want to learn about you guys. So I'm
					trying to learn about all the different cultures around the world, new cultures that I have not
					explored yet. So I wanted to get a couple books that might give me a view of Indian culture. Okay.
					So I got this book called the autobiography of a yogi and it was written by this man Paramahansa
					Yogananda.<br>
					And I'm very interested in this because for one I want to learn about the yoga culture, about the
					Indian culture, but I'm also very interested in spirituality and yoga as well. So this book is
					highly recommended by a lot of people and I've only read a little bit, but so far it's good. And the
					next one, guys, is a very important Indian book that was written a long long time ago, thousands of
					years ago, I believe. The Bhagavad Gita and this is a very important book and Mahatma Gandhi
					actually said that there is I believe he said there is no issue in your life that you will deal with
					that the Bavagita will not explain if you study it. That's a pretty good review from a very great
					man. So guys, reading is a huge part of my life and a huge hobby or pastime that I love to do.
					Do you guys like to read? If you're reading a book right now, tell me what it is.<br>
					>> So, another hobby that I don't actually do right now, but I spent years doing. I loved it, but
					there's a couple of reasons why I stopped, and I'll explain those in just a minute. Martial arts.
					Martial arts, but not like that.<br>
					Not karate or kung fu. I'm just trying to be funny, guys. I probably spent 4 years training martial
					arts a couple of days a week consistently and I absolutely loved it. I loved it because it makes
					your body in really good shape, you get stronger and it gives you a confidence, makes you confident
					that if something happens, you know how to protect yourself. Let me show you guys something cool.
					This is Well, I had this this canvas made. It looks like a painting. like a painting, but it was a
					real picture. It was a real picture and I sent it to a company and they made this for me. That's me.
					And that is a famous mixed martial artist from Mexico, but who lives here in the United States.
					His name is Miguel Torres. And I had the honor of training jiu-jitsu, Brazilian jiu-jitsu with him
					for almost 4 years.<br>
					And this was a very special day. this picture. He was giving me my blue belt.
					Okay, my blue belt. And that was just such an achievement for me. It was a goal of mine for a long
					time. And the day that I achieved it, somebody was that was there at the ceremony, they took this
					awesome picture. So when I saw the picture, I had to have this this made.<br>
					Uh that was a very awesome time in my life and I enjoyed it very much. So guys, like I said, I spent
					a long time training Brazilian jiu-jitsu. I trained some boxing, too. Some boxing.
					And I loved it. I loved every minute of it. Why did I stop? Well, guys, several reasons. One, it's
					expensive. It cost a lot of money, guys, to be a member of a a martial arts gym. And I was thinking
					to myself that I'm never going to be a professional fighter. I don't want to be. I don't want to
					hurt people. I just want to know how to protect myself and my family. So why am I spending so much
					money, thousands of dollars a year to do something that will never give me any money back? So, one
					part of it was I decided that I wanted to stop giving my time and money to that and put my time and
					money into things that can pay me back that one day can be an investment and I can make some money
					with. So, I decided that I was going to start using my time and money to improve my channel and
					learn as many different things as I possibly could. The second reason why I stopped training martial
					arts guys, it's very hard on your body. When I was training martial arts, guys, my body always hurt.
					Ow, ow, ow. My body always hurt. You're always getting injured in martial arts. And one time I had a
					terrible injury, guys. I broke I broke a bone in here and my arm was hanging like down here. I'll
					show you a picture. I did that in Brazilian jiu-jitsu. So guys, martial arts are incredible. I
					recommend that everybody learns a little bit so they could be more confident.<br>
					They can know how to protect themselves if somebody wants to hurt them. And because it's a very fun
					pastime, a very fun hobby, and I guarantee that if you go to a martial arts gym, you will meet some
					incredible people. Some of the coolest, kindest, best people I've ever met have been at the gym
					where I train Brazilian jiu-jitsu. That part I do miss. All right, next hobby. Okay, guys.
					And the last thing that I love to do in my free time that I'm going to talk about in this video is
					to experience other cultures by trying their food.<br>
					Let's go get some authentic Vietnamese cuisine.
					All right, guys. Got our Vietnamese food.
					Let's go find a nice place to try it out. Okay, guys. I found this park where I could try my fur.
					Did I say I got fur?
					So, I went to that Vietnamese restaurant. The people were very nice.<br>
					It was a small place, but it looks like they have great food. So, I got some fur, which is a noodle
					dish, a traditional Vietnamese noodle dish. And I got some spring rolls is what we would call them
					in English. There's a name that I don't know how to pronounce in Vietnamese, but I'll show you guys
					what we got. Let's try it. Wow. So, here's all the meat. Got a whole bunch of onions and different
					kinds of herbs. And then this is the broth. And here we've got even more. Looks like some sort of
					sprouts, more herbs, and some sauce. So, I guess we'll just put it all in here and find out. But
					first, let's try these spring rolls. All right, guys. So, this is what I would call a spring roll.
					It's wrapped up to wrap wrapped up in a paper made out of rice. It has shrimp, shrimp, different
					kinds of vegetables, and I think there's some pork in here, too.<br>
					And this sauce that it comes with is made out of peanuts. It's Vietnamese peanut sauce. Has peanuts,
					soy sauce, and some other ingredients. Let's try it out.<br>
					 Delicious, guys. Very fresh. The sauce, I love peanuts. I love the taste of peanuts. Very
					good sauce of the shrimp, the crunch from the lettuce, the pork, the little wrap made out of rice is
					very soft and it has a nice texture.<br>
					All right, guys. Let me eat my spring roll and then we'll check out this fur.
					All right, guys. So, let's try the broth. I ate one of my spring rolls. I'm going to save one for
					camera wife cuz she's not here. So, I'm recording myself today. Let's try the broth. Okay, the the
					liquid part of the soup, guys. You can see, I don't know if you can see, but it looks like there's a
					lot of oil in there. It's very thick, which means that they probably cooked this with a lot of
					things like bone, skin, tendons.<br>
					I'll show you what tendon is in a minute, but it means that it's probably very healthy and full of a
					protein called collagen, which comes from bone, skin, uh, tendons, and things like that.
					It's good for your skin and for your hair. So, let's try this out.<br>
					Delicious. Very good. It has uh I can taste some ginger. Taste some strong ginger in there. I like
					it. I like it.<br>
					Let's see what else we have here.
					Sriracha chili sauce. Yeah, let's make it spicy. I like spicy. So, we'll put some Sriracha in there.
					Have my chopsticks. Okay, now let's see. We'll put a little bit of lime in here.
					Vietnamese friends, tell me if I'm doing this right. I don't know what this is.
					I think this is basil. Put some basil in there. a jalapeno. Why not? And some of these sprouts.
					Okay, now let's put some some onion. Oh, and here's the noodles.<br>
					I forgot all about the noodles, guys.
					But here are the noodles. I'm guessing that they're rice noodles. It's hard to eat it like this. I
					should have ate it at the place. Okay, so there's a lot of different options, different kinds of uh
					different kinds of meat. I chose the traditional, let's see, which comes with beef. This is a
					meatball. I'm not sure if it's pork or beef, but it's bunch of ground meat that they push together
					into a ball. You know what? Let's try the meatball first.<br>
					That's a very flavorful and good meatball, guys. Now, let's try the noodles.
					Okay, so far I like f this is more beef, I believe. Let's just put all our beef in there and then
					we'll get to the interesting part. All right, guys. When I go to try new cuisine, I try to get
					something different, something interesting. So that's why I ordered the traditional one. And it has
					tendons.<br>
					This is a tendon, guys. And that's why there's so much collagen in this. So let's put that in there.
					And this, my Spanish- speakaking friends will know this as tria. Okay, this is stomach.
					We're going to do it the traditional way. All right, guys. Let's try a little bit stomach.
					Very chewy. Doesn't have a lot of flavor, but not bad. Try some of the beef.
					The beef is delicious. Let's do some noodles and beef together. Nice. Not bad. All right, let me
					find that tendon.<br>
					All right, guys. Here's the tendon. What a tendon is is the piece of tissue that holds together two
					bones at a joint. So, there's tendons in here. Okay? And that's what this is. This is not something
					that many people eat here in the US, but I am a man of the world and I like to explore new cultures.
					So, let's try it.<br>
					Very chewy. way more chewy than even the stomach. You know what? I usually when I was younger, I did
					not like things with that kind of texture. But now, as I get older, I think it's actually pretty
					good. All right, guys. Let me eat my fur and then we'll walk around and learn some interesting facts
					about Vietnam.<br>
					Okay, guys. My fur was delicious, and I am stuffed. Stuffed is a word that we sometimes use to say
					that we are very full or that we ate too much. Usually, it's a good thing to be stuffed. When you
					have an awesome dinner, you say, "Oo, I'm stuffed. I cannot eat anymore." All right. First fact that
					I saw about Vietnam is that it is completely normal to ask somebody the first time you meet them how
					old they are and if they are married or not. Now, in a lot of other places, you might think, "Oh,
					you should not ask somebody that the first time you meet them." But in Vietnam, it is considered
					polite and nice and shows your interest to get to know them.<br>
					Vietnamese friends, tell me if that's true. All right. Another interesting fact about Vietnam is
					that they have a drink called snake wine. Okay. Where they make wine out of rice and they infuse it
					by putting whole snakes in the wine. Okay? Especially snakes that are poisonous. And they think that
					this makes you healthier. Vietnamese friends, tell me, "Snake wine good? Does it make you
					healthier?" All right, guys. Here's a cool one. Southern Vietnam is famous for floating markets.
					Okay, they have these places where you can go and get on these little boats to buy the things that
					you need, such as food.<br>
					That's pretty cool. All right, guys. And the last Vietnam fact that I'm going to share for today is
					that it is one of the safest countries in the world to travel to. That sounds nice. Good food,
					safety, interesting culture. Maybe one day I'll have to go to Vietnam. All right, guys.
					I hope this video was useful for you.<br>
					Thanks so much for sharing this time with me, letting me show you my native language of English.
					Appreciate every single one of you. See you in the next video.
