				<p id="1cf468a0-53d4-81dd-bf62-d4696dd44b1d" class="">ELITA WALKER: I’m going to tell you all about data
					and
					data-informed decision making.<br />You’ll learn how data impacts decisions, some of which occur
					during
					a project journey.<br />You’ll get answers to questions like, how do I use data in my
					project?<br />Which types of data should I search for?<br />And how do I determine what stakeholders
					need to know?<br />Now, more than ever, we have access to data at our fingertips on our computers,
					tablets, and phones.<br />We use data every day to view the stats of our favorite athletes, examine
					our
					screen time on social media, and monitor our health.<br />Data is a part of our daily
					lives.<br />Take,
					for example, online job search sites.<br />These companies collect basic data you enter, like your
					previous experience, location, maybe any degrees or certificates you might hold, and use that
					information to determine potential job matches for you.<br />Jobs that don’t fit the criteria of
					what
					you entered aren’t likely to appear in your suggestions.<br />This is just one way data is used to
					inform and influence our decisions.<br />In this module, we’ll discuss project data and how it
					informs
					decision-making and helps to prevent both major and minor issues.<br />We’ll also discuss how
					project-related data can be used to reach success metrics.<br />We’ll go over common project data,
					such
					as tasks and issues, and discuss how analyzing this data and other metrics impacts project
					productivity
					and quality.<br />Finally, we’ll demonstrate how data isn’t just about numbers.<br />You can also
					tell a
					unique story using the power of data.<br />Storytelling offers a memorable way to communicate
					important
					aspects of your project.<br />Pairing storytelling with data can convince stakeholders of ways to
					resolve problems and ensure a successful outcome.<br />So data certainly has its
					benefits.<br />There’s
					a lot to learn about data, and we’ll lay out some of the basics so you can confidently tackle your
					projects.<br />[MUSIC PLAYING] Data is a big business.<br />There are 2.5 quintillion bytes of data
					created each day.<br />That’s a lot of data and a lot of information.<br />Let’s start by talking
					about
					what data is.<br />Data is a collection of facts or information.<br />And through data analysis,
					you’ll
					learn how to use data to draw conclusions and make predictions and decisions.<br />We use data daily
					to
					help us make decisions and improve performance.<br />For example, my friend is a runner who
					participates
					in annual 5-kilometer and 10-kilometer runs.<br />When she’s training for a run, she uses the data
					on
					her GPS watch to measure her time and distance.<br />She can even calculate her pace by measuring
					the
					minutes per kilometer.<br />She uses the minutes per kilometer data to track her performance over
					time
					so that she can focus on improving for the future.<br />Similarly, companies use data and data
					analysis
					to improve and bring value to their organization in a variety of ways.<br />For example, companies
					source data on customer behavior and customer demand to provide better services and create new
					products.<br />Netflix is a great example of a company that uses data intelligence to predict what
					customers want.<br />By observing data points surrounding types of genres, ratings, and number of
					repeated viewings, Netflix recommends TV shows that they believe customers might like, therefore
					improving the customer’s viewing experience.<br />In the same way, as a project manager, you can use
					data daily to make better decisions, solve problems, understand performance, improve processes, and
					understand your users.<br />Let’s examine how these benefits can impact a project.<br />Let’s talk
					about
					how this can play out in our Plant Pals project at Office Green.<br />If you have the data on
					customer
					buying patterns and identify that your best-selling products are all tropical plants, you’ll be able
					to
					make better decisions when placing new plant orders with your supplier.<br />You’ll also be able to
					better understand your users and their preferences to improve your offerings and
					performance.<br />Another daily benefit of data within your project team is the opportunity to
					improve
					processes.<br />If you have the data from your project tracker of the number of tasks completed, the
					number of escalations, or the number of issues that come up surrounding an internal process, you’ll
					be
					able to deduce where the majority of issues are stemming from.<br />This data will help inform your
					decision on where to focus your attention to improve the process.<br />While these are simple
					examples,
					through critical analysis, application, and execution, data becomes a powerful tool to guide any
					project
					in the right direction.<br />[MUSIC PLAYING] As we discussed earlier, data is the collection of
					facts
					that can help inform decisions.<br />You may start to notice how the project data impacts the team’s
					daily activities and the overall progress and success of the project.<br />This is done by using
					various
					types of metrics.<br />A metric is a quantifiable measurement that is used to track and assess a
					business objective.<br />Metrics are based on selected goals.<br />They vary per project and serve
					as a
					key type of project data.<br />There are many types of project data you can use to determine
					progress
					and efficiency.<br />You can group project metrics into productivity metrics and quality
					metrics.<br />Productivity typically measures progress and output over time.<br />Productivity
					metrics
					allow you to track the effectiveness and efficiency of your project and include metrics like
					milestones,
					tasks, projections, and duration.<br />Let’s break down each metric.<br />As you may recall from an
					earlier course, a milestone is an important point within the project schedule that indicates
					progress
					and usually signifies completion of a deliverable or phase of the project.<br />And a project task
					is an
					activity that needs to be accomplished within a set period of time.<br />A projection is how you
					predict
					an outcome based on the information you have now.<br />For example, you can predict that with the
					resources you have at the start of the project, the project will be completed in six
					months.<br />The
					duration of a project is the total time it takes to complete a project from start to
					finish.<br />Duration can also be used for milestones and determining if you’ll meet project
					deadlines.<br />This data is broken down into hours, days, weeks, months, and sometimes
					years.<br />So
					to recap, productivity metrics include milestones, tasks, projections, and duration.<br />Now let’s
					discuss quality metrics.<br />Quality metrics relates to achieving acceptable outcomes and can
					include
					metrics, such as the number of changes, issues, and cost variance, which all affect
					quality.<br />Let’s
					discuss each metric.<br />The number of changes during the project or project scope helps to monitor
					risks.<br />Changes show any inconsistencies from the initial requirements of the project.<br />A
					series
					of compounding small changes may indicate a bigger issue and provide early warning signs of these
					issues.<br />Using a change log to keep a record of these changes is a useful tool for communicating
					with stakeholders about why something is taking a long time or costs more than expected.<br />A
					change
					log is a record of all of the notable changes on a project.<br />An issue is a known and real
					problem
					that may affect the ability to complete a task.<br />For example, an issue might be the delay of
					legal
					approval for an advertisement you were hoping to launch or the missing number of confirmed seats to
					secure a venue for a business conference.<br />Another quality metric is cost variance.<br />It
					illustrates the difference between the actual cost and the budgeted cost.<br />Simply put, cost
					variance
					compares what you plan to spend versus what you actually spent.<br />Let’s put it in an
					example.<br />If
					you budgeted to only host 250 attendees at an upcoming business conference, but 275 people showed
					up,
					and the venue charges you for those additional guests, the actual cost will be higher than your
					initial
					budget or estimate.<br />So to recap, quality metrics can include things like number of changes,
					issues,
					and cost variance.<br />While these data points are commonly tracked by project managers, there are
					dozens more that you can leverage to inform decisions in your project.<br />The great news is that
					there’s a lot of sophisticated software and tools dedicated to project management and data
					analysis.<br />So you will have help keeping track of all of these different types of data in one
					centralized location.<br />Project management tools, like Workfront and Jira, track activity and
					provide
					readable results so you can measure the overall health of your project.<br />Data analysis tools,
					like
					Tableau, are useful for data visualization.<br />Now you know a bit more about how to identify
					common
					types of data.<br />You can also ID common project management software and tools that can help you
					manage and analyze data.<br />In the next lesson, we’ll cover how data helps you to make informed
					decisions.<br />Meet you there.<br />[MUSIC PLAYING] Welcome back.<br />Let’s get back to discussing
					all
					things data.<br />Earlier, we learned about what data is, its value to the project manager, and the
					different types of data a project manager works with.<br />In this lesson, we’ll discuss how to
					identify
					the most important data for your project, how to prioritize the data you collect, and how to
					effectively
					gather priorities from your stakeholders so that you’re meeting your goals.<br />Let’s get
					started.<br />Did you know that the average temperature for most humans is 98.6 degrees?<br />So if
					your
					temperature reached 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit or higher, there would likely be signals that
					something’s
					not quite right, like a sweaty forehead, muscle aches, or even dehydration.<br />Your brain would
					begin
					to receive signals that something is off because it’s the brain’s job to pay attention to the
					signals
					that indicate there’s a problem threatening your overall health.<br />That’s how you should think
					about
					data when it comes to managing your project.<br />There are all kinds of information and facts that
					you
					can gather as a project manager.<br />But it’s important for you to be aware of the signals that
					threaten the overall success of the project.<br />A signal is an observable change.<br />And it can
					help
					you to determine the overall health of your project and identify early signs that something isn’t
					quite
					right.<br />Being aware of the different types of data you have access to and knowing which signals
					to
					respond to are key to deciding what data is most important.<br />Maybe you’re asking yourself, how
					do I
					determine what data is important?<br />Great question.<br />As a project manager, it’s up to you to
					look
					for signals and to prioritize data to deliver positive results.<br />There are a couple of ways you
					can
					begin to do this.<br />One way is to observe your team’s productivity and output.<br />Identify
					which
					tasks contribute most to the overall goal.<br />This will help you determine the importance of which
					data points– in this case, tasks and activities– you should focus on.<br />Secondly, prioritize the
					data
					or metrics that are most valuable to stakeholders.<br />For example, let’s say you have an ongoing
					project at a manufacturing company to release a portable home appliance by the third
					quarter.<br />Your
					stakeholder is concerned about whether or not you’ll meet the deadline.<br />OK, start by thinking,
					what
					data do you have about the project?<br />You know that it’s the first quarter, and you’re already
					$2,000
					over budget.<br />But you also know that you’re 30 days ahead of schedule according to your burndown
					chart, which measures time against the amount of work done and the amount of work
					remaining.<br />You
					may think your project is running as scheduled, but there are additional things to
					consider.<br />For
					one, the number of tasks has increased by 10% over the last three weeks because your stakeholders
					want
					to add more features to the appliance.<br />And now your team’s productivity is slowing down because
					they’re starting to burn out from the late nights and long hours required to add in those new
					features.<br />Now how do you feel about meeting that third quarter deadline?<br />Not so good,
					right?<br />What do you do?<br />You might be tempted to focus on the signal that you’re $2,000 over
					budget.<br />But if your stakeholders communicated that they’re more concerned with meeting the
					deadline
					than they were about being over budget, then you’ll want to keep an eye on key signals related to
					time
					and scope rather than budget.<br />And then hone in on those signals to identify and prioritize
					areas to
					improve.<br />The relevant data tells you you’ll be able to meet the deadline provided that
					stakeholders
					stop requesting new product features that result in more tasks for your team to complete.<br />You
					can
					use your productivity metrics to forecast how you’ll manage an increase in scope with your team’s
					current productivity rate and communicate this to your stakeholder.<br />To avoid having to reset
					expectations with stakeholders again and again, you can keep your project plan up to date with the
					project’s priorities and ensure that this information is accessible to everyone.<br />Stakeholders
					can
					look to your project plan for a high-level overview of answers to important questions, success
					criteria,
					artifacts, and the overall health of your project.<br />Remember, there are a lot of data points
					available to you.<br />Using signals, focusing on the tasks that have the biggest impact on the
					project
					goal, and aligning to your stakeholders’ priorities are a good way to help you prioritize the right
					tasks.<br />So now that you identified data and prioritized it so that you’re working to meet
					business
					needs, the next thing to determine is how to use the data to make better decisions.<br />[MUSIC
					PLAYING]
					In this video, we’ll go into data analysis and how project managers use it to make informed
					decisions
					throughout a project.<br />We use data every day to help us make both simple and important decisions
					in
					our lives.<br />For example, imagine that you’re saving money for a big purchase.<br />Maybe you
					decided
					that the best way to reach your goal sooner is to create a budget.<br />After spending time
					reviewing
					your budget, perhaps you find that your weekly expenses are higher than your weekly allowances and
					that
					many of your expenses are from ordering food and dining out.<br />You realize that in order for you
					to
					reach your goal, you’ll need to start spending less money on eating out and find more cost-effective
					ways to buy food.<br />With this new information, you’ve found a way to save up for your big
					purchase.<br />Similar to how you might create and adjust a budget to reach a desired outcome, it’s
					your
					role as a project manager to select appropriate data to help inform your decision-making.<br />You
					can
					do this using a process called data analysis.<br />Data analysis is the process of collecting and
					organizing information to help draw conclusions.<br />It’s used to solve problems, make informed
					decisions, and support goals.<br />Businesses use data analysis to reveal important insights and
					patterns within their data that help inform actions and drive results.<br />Gathering data is only
					part
					of the process.<br />The other part is analyzing the data.<br />What you learn from your analysis
					becomes knowledge that power smart solutions for your project.<br />Project managers will often
					apply
					data analysis to look for repeated behaviors and to find a solution based on data
					predictions.<br />For
					example, let’s imagine that a rideshare company has a group of data analysts working on using
					patterns
					in rider behavior to improve customer support.<br />They notice a high demand for drivers midweek
					during
					rush hour in one specific city.<br />As a result, riders are having a hard time getting drivers to
					pick
					them up during peak hours.<br />As a project manager, you’ve been asked to come up with a solution
					to
					help meet the increased demand for drivers.<br />You work with your team to determine which data
					points
					would be most appropriate to review.<br />You might decide to track peak traffic times, the number
					of
					average daily rider requests, and the number of available drivers.<br />These data points can help
					inform how to solve for the high demand during rush hour.<br />After analyzing the data, your team
					realizes that one solution could be to offer incentives to drivers to pick up riders in the city
					during
					peak times.<br />The new incentives make drivers feel appreciated.<br />And the increase in drivers
					increases customer satisfaction.<br />And you came to this solution thanks to the insights gleaned
					from
					data analysis.<br />In this example, you collected types of data– qualitative and
					quantitative.<br />Quantitative data includes statistical and numerical facts about the number of
					rider
					requests that came in.<br />Requests in the city increased at specific points over a period of
					time.<br />The other data is qualitative data, which describes the subjective qualities or things
					that
					can’t be measured with numerical data, like user feedback about the service or product.<br />In
					project
					management, you will use both qualitative data and quantitative data points to inform decisions,
					make
					improvements, and share insights.<br />[MUSIC PLAYING] In this video, we’ll discuss how to tell a
					powerful story using data.<br />We’ll teach you how to gather and organize your project data to
					present
					it to others within your organization.<br />Presenting is a powerful way to communicate your ideas
					and
					support your decisions throughout the project journey.<br />Think of presenting as telling the story
					of
					your project.<br />Storytelling is the process of turning facts into narrative to communicate
					something
					to your audience.<br />Storytelling is how you bring data to life and is a useful way to tell
					stakeholders within your organization about your project.<br />In a way, we’re all storytellers,
					using
					information and experiences to share our ideas with others.<br />Stories usually have a beginning,
					middle, and end.<br />To tell a great story using data, we’ll go over some best practices to make
					sure
					your story is complete, accurate, and compelling.<br />In general, there are six main steps to
					storytelling.<br />First, define your audience.<br />Then collect the data.<br />Next, filter and
					analyze the data.<br />Fourth, choose the visual representation.<br />Then shape the story.<br />And
					finally, gather your feedback.<br />Now let’s review each one.<br />Step one, define your
					audience.<br />In this first step, it’s important to know who you’re presenting to.<br />Are you
					presenting to project sponsors or executives or to team members?<br />Define your audience, and find
					out
					what matters most to them.<br />Begin by asking yourself qualifying questions like, what would my
					audience want to know about the project?<br />Or what are their most urgent concerns?<br />Which key
					data points influence the story and project outcome?<br />This will set you up to know the type of
					story
					you want to tell and the type of data you should use to tell it.<br />For example, years ago, I was
					working on a project for Google Maps.<br />Our goal was to apply a label to every business in the
					world–
					restaurants, hotels, gas stations, you name it.<br />There are many, many, many businesses in the
					world.<br />And I only had a small team of engineers to work with.<br />For this project, we
					tailored
					our storytelling to an audience of vice presidents from Google Maps and Google Search.<br />Both
					were
					important to consider because we were helping users find and connect to businesses through the
					Google
					Maps app and through Google Search.<br />I’ll return to this example as I take you through the steps
					of
					storytelling.<br />Next step is step two.<br />Find the data that connects to the question you want
					to
					answer.<br />You’ll need to begin searching for data from trustworthy resources to support the point
					you’re trying to make.<br />Leverage the relevant project resources and documents, like your project
					plan or work management software, to download and analyze key data points.<br />For my Google Maps
					project, the question we were trying to answer was, where should we focus our attention
					first?<br />So
					to find the right data for this question, we turned to the many businesses in our internal database
					and
					the available information about what types of businesses users were searching for.<br />That brings
					us
					to step three, filter and analyze the data.<br />Now that you’ve collected your data, you’ll need to
					vet
					it for credibility and filter the information.<br />For my Maps project, we used search queries to
					determine the types of businesses that users search for most often, which included restaurants,
					cafes,
					and hotels.<br />There were other categories– gas stations, museums, et cetera– but they
					collectively
					made up a much smaller percentage of geospecific search traffic.<br />Step four, choose a visual
					representation.<br />Visualizations are a great way to help people remember the information you’re
					presenting and are an essential piece of storytelling.<br />You can use data in different ways to
					tell a
					story, like using dashboards, charts, infographics, and mappings.<br />And we’ll go over these
					examples
					in more detail in the next video.<br />For my Maps project, we decided on a pie chart to help tell
					our
					story, which brings me to step five, shape the story.<br />After you’ve analyzed your data and know
					how
					you’d like to visualize it, it’s time to tie it all together into one cohesive narrative.<br />Take
					some
					time to think about what you’re hoping to achieve, the points you want to make, and the questions
					and
					concerns you want to answer.<br />For the Maps project, we used a pie chart to show that most
					geospecific search queries are covered by a relatively small number of businesses.<br />So we built
					a
					story about that data.<br />We wanted agreement from our VPs to work on improving the data behind
					this
					set of categories in a few major markets and needed to illustrate that if we improve the category
					data,
					we’d succeed in improving the search results for more than 50% of geosearches.<br />Lastly is step
					six,
					gather your feedback.<br />Similar to how you may ask a friend to practice with you before an
					interview,
					you want to be sure that before you present, you do a trial run.<br />Try getting feedback from
					someone
					who’s not connected to the project.<br />Find out if it was interesting.<br />Did it make
					sense?<br />What questions did they have?<br />Their feedback can help you identify areas of your
					story
					that were unclear or unmemorable and give you a final chance to make adjustments.<br />To recap, you
					want to define your audience, collect the data, filter and analyze the data, choose a visual
					representation, shape the story, and finally, gather your feedback.<br />The key to effective
					storytelling is to be organized, intentional, and prepared.<br />[MUSIC PLAYING] Data visualization
					is
					the graphical representation of information to facilitate understanding.<br />That can include
					graphs,
					maps, and tables, to name a few.<br />Project managers use these visual representations for a few
					reasons.<br />They’re useful for communicating data to others because they help filter information
					by
					focusing the audience on the most important data points and insights.<br />Visualizations are also a
					more efficient way to summarize information because they condense long ideas and facts into a single
					image or representation.<br />And crucially, they help their viewer make sense of and remember the
					information being presented.<br />Visualizations help aid information processing and enhance
					memory.<br />It plays an active role in the storytelling process by helping communicate project
					insights
					to your audience.<br />Let’s go into some familiar types of data visualizations that project
					managers
					use throughout the entire life cycle of the project.<br />First, let’s discuss a common data
					visualization tool used when running the project– a dashboard.<br />A dashboard is a type of user
					interface, typically a graph or summary chart, that provides a snapshot view of your project’s
					progress
					or performance.<br />It acts as a centralized location for project stakeholders to draw quick
					insights.<br />It can display a tight summary of metrics, stats, and Key Performance Indicators, or
					KPIs.<br />A KPI is a measurable value or metric that demonstrates how effective an organization is
					at
					achieving key objectives.<br />They serve as a great aid in helping your team and stakeholders
					understand if you are on the right track.<br />In other words, they signal if you are making
					progress to
					reach your success criteria.<br />In your dashboard, you may have a summary of your top KPIs or
					metrics
					and your progress to date.<br />For instance, if one of your objectives is for your project to reach
					a
					95% customer satisfaction score at the end of a three-month period, you may track that goal via
					thousands of customer satisfaction surveys.<br />Rather than displaying a spreadsheet of each
					response,
					a dashboard is a good place to summarize those results and showcase the average customer
					satisfaction
					score to see how you are pacing to your goal.<br />Similarly, you could also include other key KPIs
					that
					signify progress, like a countdown that shows the number of days until project launch or the
					percentage
					of the number of issues resolved.<br />Many project dashboards may also summarize project plans,
					documents, and reports in one place and provide a visual of the status of each of them.<br />For
					example, if your project plan has hundreds of tasks with varying degrees of completion, your
					dashboard
					may summarize the amount of tasks or milestones completed at that point in time and the percentage
					of
					tasks that are in progress, complete, or not started.<br />As you may start to notice, dashboards
					are
					great visualizations for efficient status updates because they enable you to group, summarize, and
					highlight top project data points.<br />Another visualization that does this is one that we
					mentioned
					earlier, a burndown chart.<br />A burndown chart is a line chart that measures the time against the
					amount of work done and the amount of work remaining.<br />The outstanding work is usually on the
					vertical axis, with the time visualized horizontally.<br />This serves as a strong visualization to
					help
					the team picture the amount of tasks left to complete.<br />Similar to line charts, column charts
					are
					another popular graph used to signal project performance and progress.<br />Column charts are useful
					for
					comparing different activities or comparing progress over time.<br />For instance, you can show
					different outputs, like the number of customers and the number of plants delivered year over year to
					demonstrate growth and change.<br />Pie charts are useful when showing the composition of something
					or
					the parts-to-whole relationship.<br />All of these simple charts offer visualizations that enable
					you to
					draw quick insights and help tell stories.<br />There are many more in the following reading that I
					recommend checking out and practicing.<br />Before that, there is a final visual tool that I want
					you to
					know about, which is an infographic.<br />Infographics are visual representations of information,
					such
					as data or facts, and are typically in the form of what we call at Google a one-pager or a
					one-sheeter.<br />The difference is that they’re typically concise summaries of that data.<br />This
					is
					often done primarily through graphics or drawings emphasizing the biggest points with added text for
					further explanation.<br />Use infographics to present complex information quickly, professionally,
					and
					clearly, especially when you may not be present to share all of the details
					yourself.<br />Infographics
					should be able to communicate strong information without the need for extra support and
					explanation.<br />These are just a few examples of data visualization in project
					management.<br />Remember, you’ll want to use visuals to demonstrate and illustrate situations, like
					changes over time, frequency, relationship correlations, and to analyze value and
					risks.<br />Another
					important tip is to make sure that these visualizations are accessible.<br />As we mentioned before,
					you’ll want to ensure that your data story is understood by everyone.<br />[MUSIC PLAYING] You’ve
					learned the process of crafting a narrative about your project, and you’ve learned how to visualize
					key
					data points that help you to tell that story.<br />Now it’s time to bring it all together.<br />In
					this
					video, we’ll highlight some useful presentation techniques.<br />Think about one of your favorite
					public
					speakers and why you enjoy their presentations so much.<br />Is it their voice, their knowledge, or
					the
					confidence they exude while speaking?<br />Brené Brown is one of my favorite speakers.<br />She’s
					widely
					known for her 2010 TED Talk, The Power of Vulnerability, which received 60 million views
					worldwide.<br />Brown didn’t begin her career as a public speaker but as a research professor at the
					University of Houston.<br />Today, she uses public speaking as a way to teach executives and leaders
					about courage and empathy.<br />Public speakers spend a lot of time working on their
					craft.<br />Speaking to an audience, whether to inform, entertain or share, isn’t always
					easy.<br />And
					data alone isn’t enough to convince people that you’ve made the right decisions or that your project
					was
					impactful.<br />An effective presentation helps convey the important work that you and your team are
					accomplishing on your project.<br />And throughout the project, you’ll likely have many
					opportunities to
					present, from your initial kickoff meeting to your weekly status updates to your final project
					presentation.<br />As you begin to craft your narrative, think about your audience.<br />Ask
					yourself,
					what do I want my audience to know, think, or do as a result of this presentation?<br />Create your
					presentation around the big picture, and keep it simple.<br />Now let’s discuss three ways to help
					you
					give an effective presentation.<br />Those are being precise, flexible, and memorable.<br />First,
					to
					give an effective presentation, you need to be precise about your key points.<br />Identify the
					problem
					you’re solving for your audience, and remove any content that dilutes your narrative.<br />One way I
					ensure that my slideshow presentations are as precise as they can be is by using a technique called
					designing for five seconds.<br />The idea is that your audience should be able to understand a slide
					within five seconds.<br />So I keep my presentation slides simple, including only the most relevant
					data
					points to avoid overloading my audience with text they don’t have time to read.<br />To give an
					effective presentation, you also need to be flexible.<br />Flexibility is a huge part of your job as
					a
					project manager.<br />For example, it’s possible that a stakeholder may have to leave your
					presentation
					unexpectedly or that other attendees may arrive late.<br />Consider the approach you’d take if you
					had
					to shorten your presentation from an hour to 30 minutes or even just five.<br />Know the most
					important
					points you want to make, and be prepared to share only those points should the unexpected
					occur.<br />Preparing ahead of time also helps you to be more flexible when presenting.<br />Ample
					preparation helps you to avoid small mistakes that can potentially distract from your narrative,
					like
					stumbling over sentences or struggling to pull up a slideshow presentation.<br />To prepare ahead of
					time, you might practice delivering your presentation to members of your team and invite them to
					offer
					feedback, ask questions, or share concerns.<br />Preparing ahead of time also gives you space to
					identify and come up with answers to the types of questions your audience might have about your
					presentation.<br />And it also gives you time to imagine and prepare for possible objections your
					audience might have to the decisions you want to make.<br />Lastly, be memorable.<br />Develop a
					strategy that helps make your narrative unforgettable.<br />Think back to effective
					storytelling.<br />This is the point where you want to tie in your data analysis, effective
					visualization, and put the finishing touches on your narrative to bring it all together.<br />Use
					stories or include repetition to help your audience remember the information moving
					forward.<br />Another helpful tip is to be aware of your body language when
					presenting.<br />Maintain an
					upright posture, and rest your hands at your side.<br />When making a point, try elevating your tone
					of
					voice for emphasis.<br />Pace yourself by using intentional pauses.<br />And speak about half the
					speed
					you would normally speak while keeping your sentences short.<br />Make eye contact with your
					audience,
					and keep your facial expressions warm and friendly.<br />Finally, have confidence.<br />You’ve done
					the
					research and are well prepared, so you can set your worries aside.<br />If you’re precise, flexible,
					and
					memorable, you’ll give a great presentation.<br />Now that you’ve analyzed the data and crafted your
					story, your job is to present your findings effectively.<br />Use these tips to deliver a
					presentation
					worthy of a standing ovation.<br />ROWENA HALFORD: Congratulations on finishing this video in the
