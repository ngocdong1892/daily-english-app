					father my father my father he passed away on September 24th September 24th of this year so that is
					about four weeks ago now when I say he passed away say morio okay so you could say he died but it's
					a little bit nicero to say he passed away they passed away okay so my dad passed away about four
					weeks ago and it was a very strange experience for me it was sad but I'm also kind of happy because
					I I learned a lot and I think I grew a lot crazy mucho if for that I want to share the experience
					with you guys so first I want to say that when I was younger cuando Adam my dad was a good dad okay
					he was a good dad he worked really hard he gave his family all that he could okay we had food we had
					a home my dad was a good dad when I was younger okay uh my dad taught me some some valuable lessons
					in life okay my dad taught me how to work hard to work hard to earn for your family my dad taught me
					how to fish how to fish okay pescar how to clean the fish cortarlos clean the fish and uh something
					else that my dad taught me is how to to hunt Okay and to shoot guns okay so those are some of the
					things that I learned from my dad and I'm happy that he taught me those things when I was younger
					and I'll never forget them that's the reason why I work hard today okay I work hard on all my goals
					I work hard at my job to make money I work hard because when I was young my dad taught me how to
					work hard okay before on Thursday before I start to talk about the Deep things I want to talk about
					two experiences that I have with my dad that were really good okay so when I was 17 years old me and
					my dad we went we went skydiving together okay we went skydiving together this was a super cool
					experience it was super fun to go skydiving with my dad I I really I do not I do not have many
					really good memories with my dad but that is one of them okay so skydiving with my dad when I was 17
					years old was an awesome memory the second really cool experience that I shared with my dad was I
					was probably 25.
					and we went me and my dad we went to a concert okay I bought tickets for a concert and I gave them
					to my dad for his birthday because it was a band that he really loved okay it's a band old old
					vehicle rock band okay they're called Black Sabbath this is Black Sabbath and when my dad was
					younger cuando era Hoven he loved Black Sabbath but he never he never got to see them had a concert
					so I bought two tickets for his birthday and we went to the Black Sabbath concert okay and this was
					the most special experience I ever had with my dad um it was really cool I've never seen my dad so
					happy we were both lost those we were screaming ah yeah yeah screaming and wow okay it was really
					fun I was drinking Google so I was having a lot of fun my dad was not drinking because he was gonna
					drive but that was a super super fun experience that I had with my dad that is probably the best
					experience I ever had with my dad because I had never saw him so happy so excited okay so I'm glad
					I'm very glad that we we shared that experience together so now now I want to talk about the Deep
					stuff okay when I was younger me and my dad we were close we were close we spent time together we
					went fishing okay we talked but when I was 17 my dad he did something okay he's so I'll go Malo okay
					he did something bad and it hurt my family a lot okay it caused my family to go through some really
					hard times we had a lot of hard times because of what my dad did okay I don't it's not important
					what he did but it hurt me it hurt my sister it hurt my mom it hurt my family okay yeah so he he did
					that and that really damaged our relationship the relationship between my dad and my family and he
					kept on going and kept on doing more bad things more bad things more bad things okay he never said
					I'm sorry guys I'm gonna try to be better okay he uh he just kept on going and going and going uh
					sometimes humans do that right sometimes we do not know how to say I'm sorry please forgive me
					sometimes we don't know how to do that okay lo siento so things kept getting worse and worse and
					worse and for a long long time I did not speak to my dad okay I did not want to speak to him I did
					not want to look at him so this was for years years okay I didn't talk to my dad um he was a good
					grandfather to my son and he he loved he loves he loved he he's gone now but he loved my son so much
					okay and my son loved him so I appreciate that that he was a good grandpa but he and I we did not
					have a good relationship I'm 31 years old this happened when I was 17.
					so for 14 years I have not had a real relationship with my father I've had a lot of pain and anger
					in my heart in my heart my Corazon I had a lot of pain and anger for my father sometimes I even
					thought that I hated him and that's terrible to say but it's the truth I do not lie to you guys I
					tell the truth so sometimes I thought that I hated my dad but I never really hated my dad I was just
					hurt okay but it wasn't true I didn't I never hated my dad I never hated him I was just very hurt
					that he did he made bad choices that hurt my family but that day that he went to the hospital and
					the doctor said that he was not going to live very long he was going to die they said that my dad
					would pass away any day I I had no more anger I had no more pain in my heart the only thing I wanted
					was for my dad to get better I just wanted my dad to get better so that we could work on our
					relationship and have a new start okay so we could have a new relationship again that was all that I
					wanted I said that if he needs a new kidney they could take one of mine okay if they needed blood I
					would have gave it anything that I could have done I would have done to help my dad to save my Dad's
					life and then to try and help him to become happy and healthy again to have a relationship with his
					family again when he got sick and he went to the hospital that was the only thing that I wanted
					foreign so sometimes there's nothing you could do I prayed I prayed I prayed I prayed okay um and I
					would have done anything to save him and to have a second chance for a relationship with my dad but
					uh it didn't happen but I learned a lot of important things okay I learned some very important
					lessons from this I will never never in my life do anything to hurt my son or my family and if I do
					I will tell them that I'm sorry and I will try to make it better and there's one other experience
					that I want to tell you guys about that was a beautiful moment in my life okay I will never forget
					this I have not touched touched my dad not a handshake not a hug for 14 years okay okay in 14 years
					because we did not have a real relationship but when I went to visit him and he was in the hospital
					he was in the hospital bed and he had tubes in his neck in his arms IVs and all kinds of machines
					hooked up to him he had tubes up his nose so that he could breathe okay when I walked in my dad put
					out his hand he put out his hand so he could hold my hand and I held his hand and he was just
					rubbing my fingers like this but I know I know that he was trying to tell me I'm sorry and I love
					you and after that I don't have any more anger in my heart for my dad I don't hate my dad I wish my
					dad was still here so that we could try again to have a father and son relationship I know now I
					know now that my dad was not he was not an evil person and he didn't even want to do these bad
					things but he had a lot of pain in his heart and he had problems just like you just like me some of
					us know how to deal with our problems better but he did not know so the lesson that I learned from
					all of this that I want to share with you guys is if you have a mother or a father or your brother
					or your sister maybe your your son or your daughter and you guys do not have a real relationship
					because of something that happened in the past Let It Go forget about it forgive them okay I'm not
					saying I am not saying that you have to be best friends with this person that you have to spend all
					the time in the world with them but let that pain go okay don't hate anybody when you have Hate in
					Your Heart it's only hurting you okay for years I had pain in my heart for years and years and years
					I had pain in my heart because of the things that have happened in my life between myself and my dad
					but I'm grateful that in the end he knew that I was there for him and I think he knew that I forgive
					him that I love him so guys let's try our best okay let's try our best to treat each other right to
					not hurt each other okay to forgive the people that we actually love who hurt us thank you guys for
					watching this video is in honor of my father Roland senior Rest in Peace Dad thank you
