				<p id="1cf468a0-53d4-81e0-995e-e9336c934e0b" class="">Think about a time in your life when you managed a
					project.<br />Maybe it was a professional project, like creating an employee schedule, or a personal
					project, like planning a family celebration.<br />Now ask yourself this.<br />Did everything go
					according to plan?<br />If I had to guess, I would bet there was at least one hurdle you had to deal
					with.<br />That’s because no project goes 100% according to plan, even when they are run by the most
					experienced project managers.<br />Maybe you planned that employee schedule perfectly.<br />And then
					someone caught a cold, forcing you to rearrange the schedule at the last minute.<br />Or maybe just
					as
					family members started arriving for that celebration, you realized you forgot to buy ice to keep the
					drinks cold.<br />And hey, these things happen.<br />As we told you earlier, flexibility is an
					important
					skill for managing projects.<br />Due to the nature of the project– and really, life in general–
					it’s
					also important that you identify and plan for risks that could impact your project.<br />Let’s
					discuss
					what a risk actually is.<br />A risk is a potential event which can occur and can impact your
					project.<br />When you think about risk in the context of project management, you’ll think about
					them as
					hypothetical.<br />In other words, these aren’t events that will definitely happen.<br />But because
					there’s a possibility that they could happen, it’s your responsibility as the project manager to
					identify and plan for those risks.<br />Next, let’s discuss issues.<br />An issue is a known or real
					problem that can affect the ability to complete a task.<br />So what’s the difference between a risk
					and
					an issue?<br />Think of it like this.<br />A risk is an event that could potentially happen.<br />If
					the
					event actually happens, then the risk becomes an issue.<br />In other words, risks are the big
					what-ifs.<br />And issues are things that currently impact a project.<br />It is clear that risks
					and
					issues can pose a threat to your project.<br />How you manage those risks is known as risk
					management.<br />Risk management is the process of identifying and evaluating potential risks and
					issues
					that could impact a project.<br />It’s not a one-time exercise.<br />It’s something that you’ll need
					to
					do regularly to address potential risks.<br />Risk management is a crucial part of the planning
					process
					by giving you an understanding of what could go wrong with your project.<br />It also tells you who
					you
					need to consult about the risk.<br />It helps you determine how the potential risk could be
					mitigated.<br />This way, if or when something goes wrong, you’ll have a plan prepared and ready to
					go.<br />Part of being proactive and planning ahead is identifying potential risks and how to solve
					for
					them.<br />This way, you’ll set up your project with better chances for success.<br />Failing to
					engage
					in meaningful risk management can have a few big consequences for your project.<br />First, if you
					don’t
					plan ahead, you may put your project at risk of not meeting its project goal, its timelines, or its
					success criteria.<br />For example, if your goal is to publish a research report and your research
					analyst quits halfway through the project, you will likely miss the deadline if you don’t have a
					backup
					plan ready to go.<br />Additionally, by failing to plan for risks, you also fail to think through
					the
					many different ways that your project could pivot and still meet its goals, even if an issue does
					arise.<br />There often isn’t just one way to meet your project goals.<br />And success can come in
					many
					forms.<br />Risk management helps you determine how flexible or rigid your plan is and then make
					necessary adjustments.<br />For example, if your project requires a large product shipment, having a
					backup supplier ready means you could quickly pivot if our main supplier is unable to fulfill your
					order.<br />Finally, risks can affect projects in a variety of ways that are difficult to
					foresee.<br />For example, a supplier you’ve hired may not have adequate stock to cover your
					purchasing
					needs.<br />Or the budget for your project could be cut unexpectedly.<br />The risk management
					process
					helps reduce the impact of unexpected events, freeing up resources to focus on activities that
					benefit
					the project.<br />Let’s imagine risk management in the context of Plant Pals at Office Green, which
					is a
					new service that will provide customers with small, low-maintenance desk plants.<br />One potential
					project risk is the possibility that the web page for the new service won’t be live in time for the
					launch.<br />Another potential risk could be a fulfillment shortage.<br />What would you do if the
					plant
					supplier runs low on the cacti and ferns that you need?<br />To prepare for these potential risks,
					you
					will need to think about ways to mitigate these issues before they happen or how you will address
					these
					issues if they actually occur.<br />Hopefully, these things won’t be a problem.<br />But if they
					are,
					you’ll be prepared.<br />I also want to stress that issues will come up throughout the project you
					did
					not or could not have planned for.<br />And that’s OK.<br />When these moments arise, it is
					important to
					keep calm, figure out the root cause of the problem, and come up with a solution.<br />Risk
					management
					is a really important topic for project managers to understand.<br />Identifying risks and issues
					prepares you for the unknown.<br />It also positively impacts you as the project manager because
					you’ll
					feel more prepared, less stressed, and more confident in your approach if an issue does
					occur.<br />Up
					next, we will discuss ways that you can identify risks.<br />I’ll meet you there.<br />[MUSIC
					PLAYING]
					Let’s discuss tools and techniques you can use to identify risks, including brainstorming and risk
					assessment.<br />Brainstorming is one of the most effective techniques for identifying risks with a
					team
					because it allows groups to spontaneously share ideas without judgment.<br />As a project manager,
					you
					will be responsible for bringing a group of people together to imagine potential risks.<br />Have
					your
					RACI chart at the ready to refer to when you decide who to invite to this meeting.<br />Speaking
					from
					experience, the best team for this task is a diverse one, which includes individuals from various
					roles,
					backgrounds, and experiences.<br />Diverse teams bring different perspectives, experiences, and
					skill
					sets.<br />And this may help you to identify risks that you may not have thought of on your
					own.<br />For example, one member of your team might have experience working on multiple projects,
					while
					another newer team member might bring a fresh perspective from their previous experience on other
					teams.<br />A great tool that you can use during brainstorming is called a cause-and-effect diagram,
					also sometimes known as a fishbone diagram.<br />Cause-and-effect diagrams show the possible causes
					of
					an event or risk and are very useful at risk management.<br />For example, in the diagram seen here,
					the
					effect listed is a supplier missing its deadlines.<br />This is a risk to your project.<br />On the
					left, you’ll brainstorm potential causes that would lead to the effect, like poor delegation or a
					lack
					of tracking tools.<br />In other words, cause-and-effect diagrams can help identify all the ways
					that
					things could go wrong by identifying a potential risk, known as the effect, and working backwards to
					consider the potential causes of that risk.<br />By categorizing and breaking them down into further
					causes, you are able to identify areas that could lead to a potential problem, like exceeding your
					budget or allowing scope creep to impact your timeline.<br />As a reminder, scope creep refers to
					changes, growth, and uncontrolled factors that affect a project’s scope at any point after the
					project
					begins.<br />During these brainstorming sessions, you might find that your list of potential risks
					is
					quite long.<br />And that’s OK.<br />It is a reality.<br />You and your team cannot account for
					every
					single problem that can occur during your project.<br />So how do you decide which risks to focus
					on?<br />List the outcomes from the brainstorm in a risk register.<br />A risk register is a table
					or
					chart that contains your list of risks.<br />Next, you’ll adopt a risk assessment
					technique.<br />Risk
					assessment is the stage of risk management where qualities of a risk are estimated or
					measured.<br />By
					“qualities,” we’re mainly referring to how likely the risk is to occur and its potential impact on a
					project.<br />We’ll come back to this point in a moment.<br />There are a few ways to assess risks,
					but
					one we’ll focus on is creating a probability and impact matrix.<br />A probability and impact matrix
					is
					a tool used to prioritize project risks.<br />I personally love this technique and use it all the
					time
					in my role at Google.<br />Earlier, I mentioned that you’ll need to assess the likelihood that a
					risk
					will happen and its potential impact.<br />This matrix will help you do just that.<br />To create a
					probability and impact matrix, you’ll need to think about the level of impact.<br />Impact refers to
					the
					damage a risk could cause if it occurs.<br />Impact is also determined on a scale of high, medium,
					and
					low.<br />High means that if the risk occurs, it will substantially alter the project.<br />Low
					means if
					the risk occurs, it will have a slight impact, but it’s not likely to derail the
					project.<br />You’ll
					also need to think about probability.<br />Probability is the likelihood that a risk will
					occur.<br />We
					also determine probability on a scale of high, medium, and low.<br />In this case, high probability
					means there’s a high likelihood of this happening.<br />Low probability means you’ve identified a
					risk
					that could happen, but it isn’t likely that the risk will occur.<br />These two considerations come
					together to determine the inherent risk rating.<br />Inherent risk is the measure of a risk
					calculated
					by its probability and impact.<br />Measuring the inherent risk gives us a method for understanding
					a
					risk.<br />Inherent risk is also determined on a high, medium, and low scale.<br />So basically, if
					a
					risk has a low impact and a low probability, it has a low inherent risk rating.<br />These are the
					types
					of risks you don’t need to worry too much about.<br />But if a risk has a high impact and a high
					probability, then it carries a high inherent risk rating.<br />Medium to high risks are the risks
					you
					should focus on and create detailed mitigation plans for.<br />When you’re creating a probability
					and
					impact matrix, it’s important to ensure you create a matrix that meets accessibility guidelines and
					has
					information and formatting that everyone can easily and quickly understand.<br />One way to do this
					is
					to use both color and distinct shapes or text to communicate levels of risk.<br />You can learn more
					about accessibility communication by visiting course resources.<br />The way you view and manage
					each
					risk will be determined based on your organization’s risk appetite, which refers to the willingness
					of
					an organization to accept the possible outcomes of a risk.<br />You, your team, and your
					stakeholders
					may have different appetites for each risk.<br />We’ll discuss how risk appetite plays into risk
					mitigation in just a bit.<br />Certain low-level risks that could result in minor setbacks are much
					more
					tolerable than high-level risks that have the potential to completely derail your project.<br />Once
					you’ve completed your risk assessment, you’ll update the risk register to include high, medium, and
					low
					ratings for some examples of risks that you’ve identified for this project.<br />[MUSIC PLAYING]
					Let’s
					discuss some common types of risks that you might plan for while managing a project.<br />Though
					there
					are many different types of risks that could impact your project, the big ones that you want to be
					aware
					of are time risks, budget risks, and scope risks.<br />Let’s break those down.<br />First, we have
					time
					risks.<br />Time risk refers to the possibility that project tasks will take longer than anticipated
					to
					complete.<br />You’ll need to be aware of time risks because time is money.<br />Poor time
					management
					may deplete your budget and upset your stakeholders by causing delays.<br />Next, we have budget
					risk.<br />Budget risk refers to the possibility that the cost of a project will increase due to
					poor
					planning or expanding the project’s scope.<br />You need to be aware of budget risk since budgeting
					provides the basis for project cost control.<br />For example, if you overspend, you might not be
					able
					to pay your suppliers.<br />This could also result in some reputational damage for the
					company.<br />Then we have scope risk.<br />Scope risk refers to the possibility that a project
					won’t
					produce the results outlined in the project goals.<br />You need to be aware of scope risks because
					the
					deliverables of your project might not be acceptable to your stakeholders or customers, and that may
					defeat the purpose of the entire project.<br />While time, budget, and scope risks are very common,
					there are other types of external risks that you should be aware of.<br />By “external risks,” we’re
					referring to risks that result from factors outside of the company that you have little to no
					control
					over.<br />For example, your project could be impacted by an environmental risk, like a major storm,
					or
					a legal risk, like a change in regulatory requirements.<br />And it’s also important to know that
					there
					are endless types of risks.<br />There will never be a prescription for how to identify and manage
					every
					single possible risk.<br />But if you have a plan, you’ll be better set up to deal with whatever
					comes
					your way.<br />OK, now let’s discuss a certain type of risk known as a single point of
					failure.<br />A
					single point of failure is a risk that has the potential to be catastrophic and halt work across a
					project.<br />These are risks that have the power to stop an entire team in its tracks, meaning that
					no
					one can make progress on their tasks until the issue is resolved.<br />For example, in our Office
					Green
					scenario, a single point of failure might be a power outage that takes down the internal database
					where
					every piece of information about the project is stored.<br />Until the database is back up and
					running,
					your team won’t have access to any of the information they need to do their jobs.<br />As a result,
					your
					team won’t be able to complete any of their assigned tasks.<br />To mitigate this risk, you might
					budget
					for a separate cloud service to serve as your backup for all of your project documentation and
					information.<br />As the project manager, you will need to identify and monitor potential single
					points
					of failure in your project since they can be detrimental to the project timeline, budget, and
					scope.<br />Another source of risk to be aware of are dependencies.<br />A dependency is a
					relationship
					between two project tasks, where the start or completion of one depends on the start or completion
					of
					the other.<br />In other words, dependencies are like links that connect one project task to
					another.<br />A dependency must be addressed before the task can be completed or before another task
					can
					begin.<br />Because dependencies are the links that connect one project task to another, they are
					often
					a huge source of risk to a project.<br />For example, imagine that you’ve tasked a teammate with
					hiring
					a local plant supplier.<br />Until they’ve signed a contract with the supplier, your team can’t
					place
					any orders.<br />That’s a dependency.<br />Now here’s where the risk comes in.<br />If your teammate
					doesn’t meet the hiring deadline and then goes on vacation for a week, this could delay your project
					timeline.<br />Not great, right?<br />If you don’t plan for dependencies, you might risk an impact
					to
					your budget, schedule, or project outcome.<br />To prevent something like this from happening, you
					might
					ask a teammate to share their out-of-office plans with you at the start of the project.<br />This
					helps
					you to stay aware of everyone’s schedules, ensuring that there are backup plans in place to maintain
					your project schedule.<br />There are two types of dependencies– internal and
					external.<br />Internal
					dependencies refer to dependencies within the project that you and your team have control
					over.<br />For
					example, you’ll need to secure approval on a website design before development can begin.<br />On
					the
					other hand, external dependencies are dependencies that you have no control over.<br />For example,
					the
					farm that your plant vendor works at might have experienced a lighter rain season this year, meaning
					that they’ll have fewer plants to sell.<br />There are many different risks that can impact your
					project, from time risks to budget risks to scope risks.<br />But remember, no project is risk
					free.<br />And with careful upfront planning, you can do your best to prevent risks from
					occurring.<br />[MUSIC PLAYING] OK, so you’ve learned how to identify your project’s risks and
					assess
					them using a probability and impact matrix.<br />Now that you know which risks require your
					attention,
					how do you determine what to do about them?<br />This is where risk mitigation planning comes
					in.<br />Risk mitigation planning is about finding ways to eliminate or reduce the impact of
					potential
					risks to your project.<br />There are four common ways to mitigate risk.<br />You can avoid it,
					accept
					it, reduce or control it, or transfer it.<br />Let’s discuss each option using the Office Green
					example.<br />Sometimes, you can avoid the risk altogether.<br />For example, if you learn that a
					certain contractor you’ve considered working with on your Office Green project has a poor reputation
					for
					meeting deadlines, then you might choose to avoid that risk by hiring a different
					contractor.<br />You
					can also accept the risk, especially ones that you deem low in probability and impact.<br />In this
					case, you’re accepting the possibility that this risk can happen.<br />You’ve agreed to monitor it
					throughout the project.<br />And you’ll ultimately be OK with the risk if it does happen.<br />For
					instance, maybe your plant supplier tells you that one of the planter styles you’ve requested is
					backordered.<br />The supplier is confident that they’ll have time to restock the planters without
					delaying your project schedule.<br />But if there is an issue with their restock shipment, this
					could
					delay deliveries to your clients by up to two days.<br />Rather than starting over with a new
					supplier,
					you decide that it makes more sense to accept the risk.<br />It wouldn’t be ideal for this delay to
					occur, but you’re flexible.<br />And you know that accepting this risk will save you and your team
					the
					headache of onboarding a new supplier, which could take two weeks.<br />Another way to mitigate a
					risk
					is to reduce or control it.<br />Personally, I like to use a decision tree when building mitigation
					plans.<br />A decision tree is a flowchart that helps visualize the wider impact of a decision on
					the
					rest of your project.<br />For example, you decide to hire the contractor with a reputation for
					missing
					deadlines because you know they do great work.<br />In this case, you might create a quick flowchart
					that visualizes the risks and potential options for addressing it, like checking in with the
					contractor
					daily, either by email or through meetings.<br />Ultimately, you might then choose to have daily
					check-in meetings with the team to ensure that they’re staying on top of their tasks.<br />Finally,
					you
					can choose to transfer the risk.<br />For example, you’ve determined that it’s too risky to attempt
					to
					grow plants on-site at Office Green due to the possibility that bad weather or pests could
					negatively
					impact your product.<br />Instead, you’ve made a decision to transfer the risk to another party or
					parties.<br />By outsourcing plant production to local suppliers, you have the power to change
					suppliers
					if there’s an issue with quality.<br />When you transfer the risk, you don’t risk losing out on
					time,
					resources, and money.<br />So to recap, four common ways to mitigate a risk are to avoid it, accept
					it,
					reduce or control it, or transfer it.<br />Using one of these four strategies can help you
					effectively
					take control of the risks to your project.<br />Coming up, we’ll discuss how to document these risks
					in
					a risk management plan.<br />[MUSIC PLAYING] Now that you know your options for mitigating potential
					risks, let’s discuss how to document your risk planning decisions.<br />As you’ve been learning
					throughout this program, documentation is a crucial part of your role as a project
					manager.<br />This is
					especially true when identifying risks and creating a plan to mitigate them.<br />A risk management
					plan
					is a living document that contains information regarding high-level risks and the mitigation plan
					for
					each of those risks.<br />This plan helps ensure that teammates and stakeholders have a clear
					understanding of potential problems and a plan to address them, should they occur.<br />Risk
					management
					is an ongoing practice that you’ll take part in throughout the planning and execution of a
					project.<br />Since risk management evolves throughout the project, the plan should be updated
					regularly
					to add newly identified risks, remove risks that are no longer relevant, and include any changes in
					the
					mitigation plans.<br />Let’s review an example of a risk management plan similar to the one we
					sometimes
					use here at Google.<br />At the top of the document, we include the name of the company, and below
					it,
					the name of the project.<br />We also include the document author so that anyone reviewing the plan
					knows exactly who to reach out to if they have any questions.<br />This template also designates a
					spot
					for the document status.<br />As you’re building your plan, you can list the status as in
					progress.<br />Once the plan is complete, you can change the status to final.<br />We’ve also
					included
					helpful details, like when the document was created and when it was last updated.<br />Details like
					these might seem small, but it’s best practice to include them.<br />That’s because being
					transparent
					about dates provides stakeholders with a sense of how up to date the document is.<br />Below these
					details, we have the document objective.<br />Here, we’ve written that our objective is to outline
					mitigation plans for Project Plant Pals.<br />Below that, we’ve added an executive summary of our
					project.<br />Executive summaries should include a brief introduction to the normal conditions of a
					project and an outline of the potential risks that could impact the project.<br />Now onto the
					really
					important stuff– the risks and how we’ll mitigate them.<br />This document also includes the risk
					register you learned about earlier, which is a table or a chart that contains your list of possible
					risks.<br />Here, we’ve outlined one of the potential risks to Project Plant Pals, which is the
					potential for the vendor to fall behind on a deadline.<br />We’ve given this risk a medium inherent
					risk
					rating.<br />Remember that inherent risk is the measure of a risk calculated by its probability and
					impact.<br />A mitigation plan has also been included for this risk, which is to hold daily meetings
					with the vendor to help them stay on task.<br />Down in the appendix of the document, you’ll find
					the
					probability and impact charts, as well as the probability and impact matrix that we used to assess
					our
					risks.<br />Once you’ve filled out the risk management plan, you’ll share it with your team and
					stakeholders to get their input and to ensure that they are aligned with your plans.<br />Coming up,
					we’ll dig deeper into the topic of communicating risks to stakeholders.<br />See you
					there.<br />[MUSIC
					PLAYING] As you’ve learned in the past few videos, identifying and assessing risks is a crucial part
					of
					the project planning process.<br />These exercises help clarify the most important risks for you and
					your team and ensure that everyone agrees on which risks to plan for.<br />But it’s not enough for
					you
					and your teammates to simply be aware of the biggest risks to a project.<br />You also need to
					communicate these risks to your project stakeholders, whether through documentation, email,
					meetings, or
					other forms of communication you’ve deemed appropriate.<br />Your stakeholders need to be aware of
					the
					risks facing a project, because if you don’t tell your stakeholders about important risks, they may
					be
					less equipped to help you if an issue does arise.<br />For example, they might not be able to
					provide
					you with more budget, should you need it or with more resources should you require them.<br />Even
					worse, your stakeholder might be caught off guard by an issue.<br />Unpleasant surprises like these
					can
					erode their trust in you as a leader of the project.<br />They’ll likely want to know if you were
					aware
					of the possibility that this risk could occur.<br />And they might wonder why you didn’t share this
					information with them sooner.<br />That’s why it’s important to communicate early and often with
					stakeholders about medium and high-level risks.<br />It sets expectations with stakeholders about
					what
					to potentially expect during the project execution phase and demonstrates that you’ve taken steps to
					mitigate and plan for those risks, should they come up.<br />It also gives you the opportunity to
					suggest ways they might be able to help you if a risk does arise.<br />So how do you communicate
					risks
					to stakeholders during the planning phase?<br />Well, that depends on the severity of the identified
					risk.<br />For low-level risks, something as simple as an email might suffice.<br />For example,
					when
					sending out weekly planning updates to a project stakeholder, you might list a few low-level risks
					that
					are relevant to their interests and briefly explain how you’ll address these risks if they
					arise.<br />For medium-level risks, you might increase your level of communication to a direct email
					between yourself and the stakeholder in which you outline the risk with more specifics and provide a
					detailed explanation of your plan to mitigate the risk.<br />You might also link to your risk
					management
					plan to provide them with more information.<br />And you might write “urgent” in the subject line to
					stress the email’s importance.<br />The serious nature of high-level risks requires a thorough and
					direct level of communication.<br />When you’re meeting with stakeholders to go over the project
					plan,
					you might add an agenda item to present serious risks and your plans to mitigate these
					risks.<br />You
					can also use this time to collect feedback on your risk management plan and ask for insights from
					stakeholders on how they suggest handling these high-level risks.<br />Your stakeholders might have
					prior experience planning for similar risks and strategies that you hadn’t considered
					before.<br />Risk
					communication is a big part of my role here at Google.<br />As a program manager, I am constantly
					writing emails and delivering presentations on the status of my projects, often with the goal of
					sharing
					known risks and my risk mitigation plans.<br />And in discussing these plans with my stakeholders,
					we
					often uncover other risks that I hadn’t even considered.<br />For example, in a recent meeting, I
					was
					presenting a potential new product to a stakeholder on a different team.<br />In the meeting, the
					stakeholder flagged their concerns that my solution might create time and resource risks that could
					have
					a negative impact on their team.<br />This discussion gave me deeper insights of my colleague’s
					potential risks and of the product’s users’ needs, which made me realize that I needed to ask my
					project
					sponsors for additional budget and resources.<br />So it’s always a good idea to discuss your plans
					with
					your stakeholders.<br />They may have a different perspective.<br />So to recap, it’s important to
					communicate risks to stakeholders so that they’re better able to help you, should one
					arise.<br />And
					you should tailor your communication style according to the severity of the risk.<br />Up next,
					we’ll
					review and wrap up all that we’ve covered.<br />Meet me there.<br />Congratulations on finishing
