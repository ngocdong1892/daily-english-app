					hello my friends I I am Kyle and here on my channel I bring you real English real English that you
					can understand and I bring it to you in a way that is fun it's fun and you can learn not only
					English but also about all kinds of other topics okay guys I have over more than 600 videos on this
					channel so believe me if there's a almost any topic you could think of there's probably already a
					video about it here okay so please guys check out those older videos because it's a gold mine of
					English content all right so guys today today I just want to have a little bit of fun okay we're
					just going to have some fun and this is the kind of conversation you might have when you're bored
					sitting around with your friends hey dude if you could have any superpower what kind of superpower
					would you have okay that's what we're going to talk about today not just one I'm going to choose
					three superpowers that I would have if I could have any superpowers so guys when you ask somebody
					this what do they say oh I want to fly I want to fly or I want super strength or I want to be invis
					visible okay things like that how boring that's boring everybody says that and here on this channel
					we we are not like everybody okay we think differently we think differently so I tried my best to
					think of three out of the box out of the box out of the box superpowers out of the box means that
					it's not normal okay to think outside of the box is to think of things that are not typical to think
					of okay so thinking out of the box is trying to find extraordinary superpowers in this case Okay so
					the three superpowers that I would choose first I would choose to have the superpower of speaking
					every language on Earth because in my opinion speaking a different language really is a superpower
					think about it guys if you don't know a certain language and you hear two people speaking it it's
					just noise it's just noise but if you study and you learn you spend the time figuring that language
					out you can understand those sounds that mean absolutely nothing to somebody who did not learn the
					language that's just incredible to me guys so this is uh something I noticed the other day I haven't
					for a long time I haven't practice my French okay but in the last couple weeks I decided I was going
					to get back into it so I've been listening to a podcast and I understand like 90% of this podcast
					okay it's an intermediate French podcast but I showed it to my wife and she's like I don't
					understand anything to it okay or she doesn't understand anything in the podcast so for somebody who
					has not learned the language it's just noise but because I pass the time learning it I can
					understand it those noise noises have meanings and that sounds like a superpower to me so my first
					superpower would be to have the power to understand anybody and any language on the whole earth and
					I just think that would be so cool I could go anywhere and connect make real meaningful friendships
					you know have real experiences anywhere I go and when you speak somebody's language you could just
					you never know what kind of experience you'll have you never know what kind of conversations you'll
					have you'll never know who you meet what stories they have to tell and that's really why I love
					language learning and why I spend my time here helping you guys learn this language that I'm
					speaking maybe 1 year 2 year 3 years ago the sounds I'm making right now would have sounded like
					blah blah blah blah blah right but you have spent the time so now you're starting to understand how
					cool is that so number one be able to speak and understand any language on Earth I think that would
					be awesome second out of the box superpower I would have the ability to learn anything 100 times
					faster than the normal average person okay I don't want to just know everything because that's no
					fun learning is the experience and the experiences the the adventure right I just wish that I could
					learn and absorb information 100 times faster than normal now I already know all the languages from
					my first superpower so I won't waste time with those but an example I could take two weeks of a
					martial arts class and I would have 200 weeks worth of experience which is 4 years of martial arts
					and believe me guys that makes a big difference so I could uh you know spend two week weeks in
					Jiu-Jitsu two weeks in kickboxing two weeks in Muay Thai two weeks at a good American boxing gym two
					weeks with some good wrestlers and guys I would be an incredible fighter I could spend a week at a
					salsa class and I would be an intermediate salsa dancer okay I could spend a a month playing piano
					and I would sound beautiful when I played how cool would that be guys to me that would just be
					awesome you know to be able to learn anything fast oh guys after a year being able to speak all
					those languages and having the ability to learn so many things I would just spend every two weeks
					that year learning a new cool skill and by the end of that year I would be the most interesting
					person on Earth and that in itself would be a superpower so I'd be able to speak every language be
					able to learn anything like that and I'd be the most interesting person alive because I know how to
					do so many awesome things I could connect with any person in their language and I've had so many
					experiences that I could talk to them and relate to them based on their hobby because chances are
					I've done something in the last year that they are interested in that sounds pretty awesome and the
					last one guys which is by far the most important to me I would be able to heal people okay and this
					one the other two were selfish okay selfish which means that it only helps me I'm only thinking
					about myself on those other two right but this one is selfless which means you're thinking about
					everybody else but not about yourself so this third power that I would choose is selfless okay and I
					would choose to be able to heal anybody okay uh of any condition so you know I would I would just go
					around performing Miracles um I would go into hospitals and find somebody who has their family
					surrounding them everybody's crying like oh no my mom's going to die of this cancer you know
					something terribly sad I would walk in there put my arm on her shoulder and say ma'am why are you in
					this hospital bed get up and go home your family loves you and it would just boom she would be
					healed or guys I see a lot of times around here there's a lot of people you see walking around
					they're super skinny their hair is all messed up maybe they don't have teeth you know they're drug
					addicts but where does that come from it comes from years of abuse you know parents who were
					terrible to them something happened in their life that made them that way I would heal those people
					and guys I would just spend the rest of my life going around connecting with people having these
					awesome experiences and whenever I came across somebody who needed healing I would heal them and
					then I would use my other two powers to connect with them and I would just go around and make the
					world such a better place and that would be my mission for the rest of my life go around helping
					people connecting you know just doing incredible things and meeting incredible people and saving the
					people who cannot enjoy life because of the condition they're in so yep that would be what I would
					do guys those would be my three superpowers so guys your homework assignment for today your homework
					because every class every good class has homework right write down in the comments what would be the
					number one super superpower that you would choose what superpower would you like to have if you
					could have any superpower guys I really look forward to reading what you say so do me a favor write
					a comment down below give the video a thumbs up all right guys thank you for spending these few
					minutes with me and having this silly fun uh entertaining conversation with me okay I hope that this
					little bit of English made your day a little bit better and helped you go just a little bit further
					on your English learning Journey all right my friends thank you so much for watching kto are you
					still there did you watch until the very end if you watched until the very end of this video I thank
					you I'm grateful for that got a little bonus for you guys so I wanted to just share something with
					you guys I like to tell you guys what's going on in my life the things that I'm trying to do you
					know Hobbies or skills I'm trying to learn things like that I used to play guitar and for several
					years I kind of quit you know some difficult things were going on in my life I had so many other
					things to do so guitar got pushed to the side lately I've been thinking I would like to make music
					again so I went and I bought a guitar this guitar I bought it's used okay secondhand which means
					somebody else owned it before me it's not an expensive guitar at all it's cheap uh it's got a little
					bit of damage here the neck is cracked I hope it's going to last though it sounds pretty good and uh
					Sur surprisingly I still remember the chords [Music] I still remember most of the chords so that's
					cool I still remember how to do a [Music] scale and a scale is just something you do to train your
					fingers and to start learning about music theory they call it so I've been trying really hard to
					remember the songs I Used to Know and uh learn a couple of new [Music] ones I remember that one
					Johnny Cash his cover of the song Hurt uh what else do I remember [Music] that was something that I
					wrote a long time ago guys and I wrote lyrics to it too and it took me so long I I had to sit and
					think for like hours guys to try to remember the lyrics but I finally remembered them I'm not a good
					singer so I'm not going to sing it uh what else [Music] H that was one of the first things I ever
					learned the little introduction to Crazy Train by Azie Osborne uh what else guys what else what have
					I been trying to learn oh I'm trying to learn uh When Doves Cry by Prince that song has been stuck
					in my head lately so how's that go oh so there's this little part where you [Music] Tab and then
					what's after that I just learned oh E [Music] minor then F all right guys I'm trying to learn that
					one so give me a break don't judge me too hard hard okay but anyway the point is I got a guitar I've
					really enjoyed uh picking it back up and playing you know sometimes I'll just be watching TV and
					just mess around get my fingers going again just doing the little stuff like the scales or
					practicing switching between chords stuff like that um yeah guys just wanted to share that with you
					because it's something that I'm looking forward to putting some time into and getting good my goal
					with this guys is to get good enough to where I can just Jam play with another guitarist you know a
					guitarist who's probably much better than me but I could at least Play Rhythm and they could do
					little like solos and stuff they could do solos so it would be fun to play with another player so
					I'm thinking about maybe taking a a couple classes I know some good guitarists I don't know if they
					offer uh classes but if they do I'm going to see if they want to do that and I think that would be
					awesome and who knows maybe here in the future I'll make a video jamming with somebody or uh I'll
					play and my sister she sings very well maybe I'll play and she could sing or maybe I'll learn how to
					do like a a rap beat on here and my buddy Carl can rap while I play and make them become the guitar
					all right guys that was the bonus section thanks so much for sticking around to the end you guys are
					my loyal subscribers my cherished friends appreciate you guys so much later
