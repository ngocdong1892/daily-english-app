					have a
					better sense of how the different parts of initiation come together to form the beginnings of a
					project.<br />So far you’ve outlined the key components of project initiation, and most importantly,
					you’ve learned that a lack of preparation during this stage can lead to problems later
					on.<br />We’re
					going to continue honing your project preparation skills.<br />Once we’re done here, you’ll be able
					to
					define and create project goals and deliverables, the guiding stars of your project.<br />You’ll
					also be
					able to define project scope, the boundaries of your project that state what is and is not part of
					your
					project.<br />You’ll be able to identify what’s in scope and out of scope for our project, and
					you’ll be
					able to recognize scope creep, something you need to keep a close eye on to help you reach your
					project
					goal.<br />Finally, you’ll be able to explain different ways of defining and measuring your project
					success criteria.<br />Before we get started, I’d like to talk through an example that will follow
					for
					the rest of this course.<br />Imagine that you’re the lead project manager at Office Green, a
					commercial
					landscaping company that specializes in plant decor for offices and other businesses.<br />The
					director
					of product at office green has an idea for a new service called plant pals to offer high volume
					customers small low maintenance plants like little cacti, leafy ferns for their desks.<br />As the
					project manager, you’ve been tasked with managing the rollout of this new service.<br />As we go
					through
					this course, we’ll return to your role as the project manager at Office Green to help teach you
					about
					project goals, deliverables, and success criteria.<br />You’ll also see the role your team and
					stakeholders play in creating and following these three important components.<br />At the end,
					you’ll
					compile everything you’ve learned into a shared document that you can use as a portfolio to share
					with
					future employers.<br />After this course, you move on to the next phases of the project lifecycle
					and so
					will your Office Green project.<br />Enjoy.<br />[MUSIC PLAYING] First things first, to set up a
					project
					for us and to make your job easier, you want to figure out what needs to be done before you actually
					get
					started.<br />You need to define exactly what your goals and deliverables are so that you’ll be able
					to
					tell your team members what to do.<br />You need a clear picture of what you’re trying to
					accomplish,
					how you’re going to accomplish it, and how you know when it has been accomplished.<br />Let’s define
					project goals so that you can start to figure out what your project team needs to do to reach
					it.<br />A
					project goal is the desired outcome of the project.<br />It’s what you’ve been asked to do and what
					you’re trying to achieve.<br />For example, your goal could be to improve the response time to
					customer
					inquiries via email by 20%.<br />The goal of your office green project might be to increase revenue
					by
					5% through a new service called Plant Pals that offers desk plans to top customers by the end of the
					year.<br />Goals are important because they give you a roadmap to your destination.<br />Without a
					clear
					goal in mind, how can where to go or how to get there?<br />Now, one of the biggest differences
					between
					what makes a good goal and a not so good goal is how well it’s defined, meaning how clear and
					specific
					is the goal.<br />If the goal is your destination, are you confident you’ll know when you’ve
					arrived?<br />The examples I mentioned before to improve the response time to customer inquiries via
					email by 20% and to increase the office green revenue by 5% are too well defined goals because they
					tell
					you what you’re trying to achieve.<br />But wait, there’s more.<br />These goals also tell you how
					to do
					what you’ve been asked to do.<br />In this case, it’s via email, through a new service offering, and
					that’s not all.<br />These goals clarify the goal even further by saying to improve by 20% and
					increase
					by 5%.<br />Now we know where we’re going.<br />Well defined goals are both specific and
					measurable.<br />They give you a clear sense of what you’re trying to accomplish.<br />Really great
					goals have even more detail, but I’ll get to that soon.<br />When you start a project take time to
					review your goals and make sure they’re well-defined.<br />To do this, you might need to get more
					information from your stakeholders.<br />Talk to them about their vision for the project.<br />Ask
					how
					this aligns to the company’s larger goals and mission.<br />By the end of that conversation, you and
					your stakeholders should agree to support the project goals in order to avoid running into issues
					later
					on.<br />Here’s an example from my own experience as a project manager.<br />Our team have finished
					a
					new product feature.<br />Our stated goal was to deliver an early version of this feature and
					collect
					user feedback.<br />When we delivered the feature to one of our key customers for user feedback, the
					customer didn’t have anyone available to try it out.<br />Our team debated whether or not we have
					met
					our goal if we hadn’t collected user feedback.<br />Some felt that we hadn’t achieved the stated
					goal
					while others thought we did.<br />The customer was satisfied with our team’s ability to deliver a
					feature in the timeline stated, but our internal team wasted valuable time going back and forth
					about
					it.<br />That said, make sure that before you start your project, you, your stakeholders, and your
					team
					are all clear on the project schools so that you are making the right kind of progress.<br />I’ll
					teach
					you a process for how to do this coming up.<br />Once you have the goals nailed down, it’s time to
					examine the project deliverables.<br />Project deliverables refer to the tangible outcomes of the
					project.<br />In other words, a deliverable is what gets produced or presented at the end of a task,
					event, or process.<br />Take the goal to improve customer response time.<br />A deliverable for that
					goal could be the creation of email templates for responding to typical questions.<br />Your office
					dream project goal to increase revenues could have two deliverables, launching the plant service and
					a
					finished website the highlights the new kinds of plants being offered.<br />These are considered
					deliverables because they describe tangible outputs that show stakeholders how additional revenues
					will
					be generated.<br />There are all sorts of project deliverable examples.<br />A pretty common one is
					a
					report.<br />When a goal is reached, you can visibly see the results documented in a chart, graph,
					or
					presentation.<br />Deliverables help us quantify and realize the impact of the project.<br />Just
					like
					needing well-defined goals, you need well-defined deliverables for pretty much the same
					reasons.<br />Deliverables are usually decided up front with the stakeholders or clients involved in
					the
					project.<br />They hold everyone accountable and are typically a big part of achieving the
					goal.<br />Make sure to ask questions about what the deliverables should be and have everyone share
					the
					vision and expectations of the deliverables so you’re all on the same page.<br />Coming up, you’ll
					practice the art of defining your goals even further by following the SMART
					method.<br />Enjoy.<br />I
					already mentioned that goals should be Specific and Measurable.<br />The SMART method to evaluate
					goals
					adds three more considerations for success, be Attainable, be Relevant, and be Timebound.<br />Put
					them
					all together, and what do you have?<br />SMART goals.<br />As an entry level project manager, you
					may or
					may not be setting the project’s main goals, but you will need to be able to identify and clarify
					them
					as needed.<br />And that’s where the SMART method can be a valuable tool.<br />Let’s take a closer
					look
					at each term.<br />As I’ve already mentioned, if your goal is not specific you will have trouble
					figuring out how long it should take to complete and whether or not you’ve accomplished it.<br />For
					example, if the goal was simply to improve customer service response time, that’s not very
					specific.<br />It does tell you what you want to achieve in general, but it doesn’t say anything
					else.<br />If you improve response time by 1%, is that enough?<br />If after five years response
					time
					finally goes up, is that enough?<br />How about if only half of your staff improves their response
					times, but the other half stays the same?<br />Specific goals should answer at least two of the
					questions I’m about to ask.<br />What do I want to accomplish?<br />Why is this a goal?<br />Does it
					have a specific reason, purpose, or benefit?<br />Who is involved, and who is the recipient,
					employees,
					customers, the community at large?<br />Where should the goal be delivered, and finally, to what
					degree?<br />In other words, what are the requirements and constraints?<br />Next, we want to set
					goals
					that are measurable meaning we can determine that they were objectively met.<br />Measuring is not
					only
					a way for people to track progress but also a tool to help people stay motivated.<br />You can tell
					if a
					goal is measurable by asking how much, how many, and how will I know when it’s
					accomplished.<br />Sometimes the success of a goal can be measured with a simple yes or no.<br />Did
					you
					learn how to play guitar?<br />Yes or no.<br />You will need to measure most of the goals you have
					with
					metrics.<br />Metrics are what you use to measure something like figures or numbers.<br />For
					example,
					if your goal was to run a 5K, 5 kilometer race, then distance in kilometers is your metric.<br />At
					Office Green, the project goal is to increase revenue by 5%.<br />In this case, revenue is the
					metric.<br />Lastly, consider benchmarks or points of reference to make sure you’re choosing
					accurate
					metrics.<br />For instance, if your overall goal is to increase revenue, you can look at last year’s
					data as a benchmark for deciding how much to increase revenue this year.<br />If last year’s revenue
					increased by 3%, then an increase by 5% in a booming economy would be a reasonable goal for this
					year.<br />OK, so the goal is specific and measurable, but is it attainable?<br />Can it be
					reasonably
					reach based on the metrics.<br />Typically you want goals that are a little challenging to encourage
					growth.<br />Otherwise, what’s the point of the goal if nothing’s going to change.<br />However, you
					don’t want it to be too extreme, or you’ll never reach it.<br />You’ll have failed before you even
					started.<br />Aim to find a balance between the two extremes.<br />For example, let’s take the goal
					to
					run 5K.<br />Say you regularly run 2.5 kilometers three times a week.<br />An attainable goal would
					be
					to go from running 2.5 kilometers to running five kilometers within four weeks.<br />An unattainable
					goal might be earning first place in 5K.<br />I mean, it could happen, but it’s not likely,
					especially
					if you’ve never run a race before.<br />But how can you know if a goal is attainable if it’s
					unfamiliar.<br />A clue to helping you figure out if your goal is attainable is to ask how can it be
					accomplished.<br />Break down the goal into smaller parts and see if that makes sense.<br />Going
					from
					2.5 kilometers to 5 kilometers over four weeks means increasing your distance by a little over half
					a
					kilometer each week.<br />That’s not so bad.<br />Use the same process on your Office Green project
					goal.<br />Businesses usually conduct quarterly reviews.<br />So let’s assume the increase is
					expected
					to occur over the course of a year, four quarters.<br />In order to meet the goal, you need to see
					an
					increase of at least 1% each quarter.<br />Seems pretty reasonable to me.<br />What wouldn’t be
					reasonable is setting a goal of increasing revenues by 50% or 100% unless your research showed that
					business was improving that quickly.<br />Your goal is specific, measurable, and
					attainable.<br />Now
					let’s see if it’s relevant.<br />In other words, does it make sense to try and reach this
					goal?<br />Think about how the goal lines up with other goals, priorities, and values.<br />Ask
					whether
					the goal seems worthwhile.<br />Does the effort involved balance out the benefits?<br />Does it
					match
					your organization’s other needs and priorities?<br />Everyone from the client and the project team
					and
					the people who will ultimately use the product need to feel like the goal is worth
					supporting.<br />Also
					consider the timing.<br />Both the amount of time the project will take as well as the larger
					economic
					and social context can have big impacts.<br />There might be a budget to complete the project now,
					but
					will the company be able to sustain the project over time?<br />Is there an audience that will
					continue
					to use the product or service once it’s delivered.<br />Once you’ve got the answers to these
					questions,
					you should have a clear goal to help steer the project.<br />If you still don’t feel confident about
					the
					project’s goals, keep digging.<br />It’s OK to ask questions if you have doubts.<br />Communicate
					your
					concerns with the project senior stakeholders and your direct supervisor if you have one.<br />They
					should be able to address some of your concerns so that you can feel confident about moving
					forward.<br />All right, if you’re feeling good about the project being relevant and attainable and
					you’ve made sure it’s measurable and has the specifics to keep you and your project team focused,
					the
					final item on the checklist is to make sure it’s timebound.<br />Timebound means your goal has a
					deadline.<br />Deadlines give you a way to track your progress.<br />Otherwise, you might never
					reach
					your goal or never even get started.<br />Time and metrics often go hand in hand because time can
					also
					be used as a metric.<br />Making your goal timebound gives you a way to break down how much needs to
					be
					accomplished over time.<br />For example, if you need to increase revenues by the end of the year,
					you
					can break down how much you need to increase each quarter, month, and week.<br />And there you have
					it,
					specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and timebound, a nearly foolproof method to create and
					evaluate your project goals.<br />And you know what they say, work smarter, not harder.<br />[MUSIC
					PLAYING] Simply put your project scope includes the boundaries of a project.<br />The way we define
					a
					[INAUDIBLE] is an agreed upon understanding as to what is included or excluded from a
					project.<br />Scope helps ensure that your project is clearly defined and mapped out.<br />That
					means
					knowing exactly who the project will be delivered to and who will be using the end result of the
					project.<br />You also need a firm understanding of the project’s complexity.<br />Is it
					straightforward
					with an easily manageable list of tasks, or will it require extensive research, multiple rounds of
					approvals, and a large scale production process that will take years to complete?<br />Scope also
					includes the project timeline, budget, and resources.<br />You’ll need to clearly define these so
					that
					you can make sure you’re working within those boundaries and what’s actually possible for the
					project to
					work.<br />Poorly defined scope or major changes to your scope can cause changes to the budget,
					timeline, or even final outcome of the project.<br />Let’s look at the scope of your Office Green
					project as an example.<br />As a reminder, the new Plant Pals service offers customers small low
					maintenance plants like cacti and leafy ferns that they can place on their desks.<br />Customers can
					order them online or from a print catalog, and Office Green will ship the plants straight to the
					customer’s work address.<br />Things to consider for your scope then might be whether or not to
					provide
					replacement plants, which customer segments will be offered the service, whether or not the online
					catalog is an app, a website, or both, and how to ensure customers can purchase from the online
					catalog
					whether by phone, PC, Mac, iPhone, or Android.<br />You might also consider the dimensions of the
					paper
					catalog and whether it needs to be in color or black and white and on what kind of paper.<br />Now
					how
					do you actually figure out the scope of your project?<br />It’s simple talk to your sponsors and
					stakeholders.<br />Understand what their goals are and find out what it is– and this is really
					important– what is not included in the project.<br />We’ve covered a number of different ways to
					help
					you determine scope.<br />Here are a few more helpful questions to add to the list.<br />Where did
					the
					project come from?<br />Why is it needed?<br />What is the project expected to achieve?<br />What
					does
					the project sponsor have in mind?<br />Who approves the final results?<br />Now you’ll really be
					set.<br />As for timing, defining project scope to happen during the initial planning
					stage.<br />You
					want to start figuring out the scope early on so that everyone can’t agree to the same set of
					expectations.<br />It will help mitigate the risks of big changes down the line.<br />Although you
					can
					always adjust the scope as planning continues if you need to.<br />Once you understand your project
					scope, you want to document all the details so that anyone can refer back to it throughout the
					lifecycle
					of the project.<br />We’ll talk about some best practices for that at the end of this
					module.<br />Let’s
					recap.<br />A clearly defined scope describes all the details of a project and regulates what can be
					added or removed as it progresses.<br />While it’s ultimately the project manager’s responsibility
					to
					monitor the project and make sure all the work and resources fall within its scope, team members and
					stakeholders can be encouraged to do their part by focusing on the tasks that are the most important
					to
					reaching the project’s goal.<br />[MUSIC PLAYING] Tasks that are included in the project and
					contribute
					to the project’s overall goal are considered to be in scope.<br />Tasks that aren’t included are
					called
					out of scope.<br />It’s your job as a project manager to set and maintain firm boundaries for your
					project so that your team can stay on track.<br />For example, if the copywriters or designers of
					the
					Plant Pals catalog came up with the idea to expand the type of plans being offered to top customers,
					you
					would have to point out that their suggestion is out of scope and would take extra time and add to
					your
					budget costs.<br />As you progress through the project lifecycle, you’re going to encounter
					unexpected
					challenges or have new details or ideas brought to your attention that could impact your project
					success.<br />Changes, growth, and uncontrolled factors that affect a project scope at any point
					after
					the project begins are referred to as scope creep.<br />Scope creep is a common problem, and it’s
					not
					always easy to control.<br />It’s one that we struggle with on every single project.<br />It can
					happen
					on any project in any industry.<br />Imagine you’re working in a tech company, and your project
					involves
					working with designers and engineers to update the language icons design on a mobile keyboard app
					for a
					smartphone.<br />While the team is making the update, they realize that the Search icon and the
					Voice
					Input icon also need a design refresh.<br />These are very small features.<br />And while
					technically
					not in scope, the team feels it would take minimal effort and provide lots of value.<br />So they go
					ahead and make the updates.<br />During a stakeholder review, it’s pointed out that there is a
					keyboard
					in English but no keyboards for other languages, and the suggestion is made to design additional
					keyboards.<br />At this point, the project scope is in danger of expanding from a fairly simple icon
					update to a complex rollout of multiple keyboard layouts.<br />Adding the keyboards would impact the
					team’s timelines causing the project to take longer to finish.<br />It would also impact resourcing
					because you would need to hire more people or existing team members would have to work over
					time.<br />And it would increase the budget since the team did not anticipate costs for extra
					working
					hours or keyboard translations.<br />This is just one example of scope creep.<br />Sometimes it’s
					subtle, just design one or two more icons, or more obvious, hey, can you tack on designing keyboards
					for
					other languages.<br />By identifying scope creep and being proactive, you protect your project and
					your
					project team.<br />To help you combat scope creep, it’s good to know that there are two major
					sources
					from which it comes, external and internal.<br />External sources of scope creep are easier to
					recognize.<br />For example, if you’re working on a project with one main customer, the customer
					might
					request changes or the Business environment around you might shift or the underlying technology
					you’re
					using might change.<br />While you can’t control everything that happens, there are some useful tips
					to
					keep in mind.<br />First, make sure the stakeholders have visibility into the project.<br />You want
					them to know the details of what’s going to be produced, what resources are required, how much it
					will
					cost, and how much time it’ll take.<br />Also get clarity on the requirements and ask for
					constructive
					criticism of the initial product proposal.<br />It’s important to get this information before any
					contracts are signed.<br />Be sure to set ground rules and expectations for stakeholder involvement
					once
					the project gets started.<br />Come to an agreement on each of your roles and responsibilities
					during
					execution and status reviews.<br />Once you’re clear on the project scope, come up with a plan for
					how
					to deal with out-of-scope requests.<br />Agree on who can make formal change requests and how those
					requests will be evaluated, accepted, and performed.<br />And finally, be sure to get these
					agreements
					in writing.<br />This way you always have a documentation to point to if you, a stakeholder, or the
					customer have a disagreement down the line.<br />One of the leading causes of external scope creep
					is
					not being clear on the requirements before defining the scope and getting formal approval to move
					forward with the project.<br />This is where those specific immeasurable goals and deliverables come
					into play.<br />If the requirements aren’t specific and if you haven’t agreed on the project’s
					processes, deliverables, and milestones, then you’re almost guaranteed to be dealing with scope
					creep
					once the project begins.<br />Internal sources of scope creep are trickier to spot and harder to
					control.<br />This kind of creep comes from members of the project team who suggest or even insist
					on
					process or product changes or improvements.<br />It’s possible that a product developer will justify
					a
					decision on the grounds of making the product better even though it’s going to cost more, or a team
					lead
					might decide that a certain process is more efficient without realizing the impact the change in
					process
					will have on other team members tasked with different parts of the project.<br />What you need to
					make
					clear to your team is that any change outside of the project scope comes off the bottom line,
					threatens
					the schedule, and increases risk.<br />There are no small impacts to project scope.<br />Any time a
					team
					member takes on an unplanned task, more is lost than just the time spent working on that
					task.<br />It’s
					your responsibility as the project manager to maintain the limits of the project.<br />The best
					defense
					is to know the details of your project in and out so you’re always prepared with the most
					appropriate
					response to a new idea or request.<br />Let’s recap.<br />Monitor your project scope and protect it
					at
					all costs.<br />Even the most minor change can mean major risks to your project’s
					success.<br />Coming
					up, I’ll tell you about the triple constraint model and how you can use it to help determine how
					your
					project changes affect scope.<br />Stay tuned.<br />[MUSIC PLAYING] Managing scope goes hand in hand
					with goal setting.<br />For example, redefining the scope can change the goal, and a revision of the
					goal can change the scope.<br />The concept of project scope is important throughout the
					project.<br />While your project will have its own specific goals, the overall goal for you as the
					project manager is to deliver the project according to the scope of agreements.<br />This includes
					delivering the project within the given deadline and the approved budget.<br />You’ll quickly find
					that
					this is easier said than done.<br />As you progress through your project, you will continually need
					to
					make compromises and weigh trade offs as new challenges and changes and factors present
					themselves.<br />Any time a team member takes on an unplanned task, more is lost than just the time
					spent working on that task.<br />In order to decide if a scope change is acceptable and what impact
					it
					will have, project managers usually refer to the triple constraint model.<br />The triple constraint
					model is the combination of the three most significant restrictions of any project, scope, time, and
					cost.<br />We’ve talked a bit about what scope is, so let’s focus now on time and cost.<br />Time
					refers
					to the project schedule and deadlines.<br />Cost includes the budget, and it also covers resources
					and
					the people who will work on the project.<br />Both time and budget have to be carefully managed
					alongside scope.<br />All three of these are linked.<br />You can’t change one without having an
					impact
					on the others.<br />For example, a decrease in costs means a change in time or scope.<br />An
					increase
					in time means a change in scope or cost or both.<br />Understanding how changing one impacts the
					other
					two constraints is key.<br />It’s important to consider what trade-offs you’re willing to make as
					the
					project progresses.<br />To do this successfully, you need a clearer understanding of the project
					priorities.<br />You have to know what is most important when it comes to scope, time, and
					cost.<br />If
					there’s a specific deadline that must be met, then you need to limit any changes to the scope that
					might
					cause the project to go past the deadline.<br />If the product must look or function in a certain
					way,
					then the requirements are a priority.<br />And you could justify changes in costs or time in order
					to
					meet the scope requirements.<br />But just because you can make a change, that doesn’t mean you
					necessarily should make a change.<br />And even though the limits of scope, time, and cost have been
					set, you can still make changes if there’s a good reason to do so.<br />Don’t worry.<br />You won’t
					have
					to decide on these changes all by yourself.<br />If there are scope decisions that need to be made,
					the
					project manager will likely need to consult with the project sponsor and stakeholders to get their
					approvals.<br />Let’s go through a few scenarios.<br />So you can get familiar with weighing the
					value
					of a trade off and understanding the impacts of any changes.<br />In the first scenario, a request
					has
					been made to improve the Plant Pal’s product features.<br />The director of product at Office Green
					wants to use pots to indicate when the plants need to be watered.<br />Making changes to the product
					is
					a scope change.<br />You know that you can’t change the budget, but you can extend the
					timeline.<br />So
					you can accept the scope change request and extend the timeline as long as the budget doesn’t
					increase.<br />Here’s another possible scenario, a request has been made to reduce the budget
					without
					making any changes to the scope.<br />The final outcome of Plant Pal still needs to look and
					function as
					you all originally agreed.<br />If you’re going to reduce the budget and keep the scope, you may
					need to
					extend the timeline.<br />OK, here’s another scenario.<br />There’s a request to tighten up the
					timeline
					and finish early, but you can’t increase the budget.<br />In order to do this, you need to make
					changes
					to the scope like limiting shipping options.<br />Doing this will give your project more time
					because
					you’ll have one less shipping contract to negotiate.<br />The end result won’t be exactly what was
					originally agreed on, but it means getting it up earlier as requested and within budget.<br />Let’s
					try
					one more.<br />In this last scenario, the director of product informs you that the project deadline
					must
					be met.<br />It’s the most important thing.<br />In this case, your stakeholders are willing to
					increase
					the budget and make any necessary changes to the scope requirements in order to meet the
					deadline.<br />In the end, it’s all about prioritizing which element of the triangle matters the
					most in
					the project.<br />Are you getting the hang of trade-offs?<br />Keeping in mind scope, time, and
					costs as
					you manage a project will help you navigate different conditions while still achieving your
					goals.<br />Remember, change is inevitable when managing projects, and understanding this framework
					can
					set you up to plan and communicate accordingly so your project will succeed.<br />[MUSIC PLAYING]
					Many
					people think the time to decide if a project is successful is when you’ve produced the final outcome
					and
					presented it to the client.<br />That’s getting close.<br />Delivering the final result of your
					project
					to the client or user it’s what’s called a project launch.<br />You finish building or creating the
					project, the tasks are completed, and the deliverables are done.<br />You’ve hit your goal.<br />The
					project is successful and considered complete in that sense, but does it work well?<br />Did it
					achieve
					your desired outcome?<br />The real deciding factor of project success is when you put the final
					outcome
					to the test.<br />Landing is when you actually measure the success of your project using the success
					criteria establish at the outset of the project.<br />This is a crucial part of goal-setting that is
					often overlooked in the initiation phase.<br />For example, think about taking a trip on an
					airplane.<br />It’s not enough for the pilot to be able to get the plane of the ground.<br />To
					arrive
					safely at your destination, they’ve got to know how to land.<br />Your success has to continue
					beyond
					the point of delivering the final project.<br />You need to be able to measure whether the project
					functions as intended once it’s put into practice.<br />Let’s take the example of your project Plant
					Pals.<br />You’ve managed to launch the new service with success.<br />The website has
					launched.<br />The catalogs have been printed and delivered.<br />Orders have been received, and
					revenue
					is starting to go up.<br />It will be easy to call this a win and move on, but what happens if the
					customers are unhappy once the plants are delivered?<br />What if the plants start to wilt and lose
					color after a couple of weeks?<br />Just because launching the project and getting it out the door
					looks
					like success on paper, that doesn’t mean the project has managed to land.<br />For most projects, a
					launch itself isn’t a meaningful measure of success.<br />It’s what comes after the launch that
					really
					counts.<br />Launches are only a means to an end.<br />And looking beyond the launch, it’s important
					to
					ensure the launch achieves your overall goals.<br />If you start off looking beyond the launch to
					the
					landing, you’re more likely to get where you’re trying to go.<br />Since landing is a concept and
					not a
					finite definition, it’s important to define what a successful landing looks like for a particular
					project.<br />Luckily, we have a way to measure and help you ensure the success of your
					project.<br />It’s called success criteria.<br />And if you can managed to follow it through the
					lifecycle of your project, you’ll ultimately have a smooth landing.<br />The success criteria
					includes
					all the specific details of your goals and deliverables, and it can be a guide so you know whether
					you’ve accomplished what you set out to do.<br />Success criteria will set the standard for how your
					project will be judged.<br />[MUSIC PLAYING] At the beginning of the project, you defined goals and
					deliverables that are measurable meaning that you can determine if they were met.<br />Similarly,
					you
					need to define success criteria that can also be measured, so you’ll know whether they were
					met.<br />The success criteria will tell you whether or not the project as a whole was
					successful.<br />They are the specific details of your goals and deliverables that tell you whether
					you’ve accomplished what you set out to do.<br />They are the standards by which the project will be
					judged once it’s been delivered to stakeholders and customers.<br />Defining success criteria also
					clarifies for your team what they’re trying to accomplish beyond just launching something to
					users.<br />Is it to increase customer satisfaction with the service, so they can continue to
					purchase
					more products?<br />Enhance an existing feature to retain customers?<br />Depending on the project,
					the
					answers will be different, but it’s important that a team is aligned and working towards a shared
					goal.<br />Sometimes forcing the conversation and clarifying what the end result looks like can
					bring to
					light questions and areas of disagreement.<br />There isn’t a set process for determining success
					criteria, but I’ll break down a couple of key points to consider.<br />Remember the measurable part
					of
					your SMART goals?<br />One of the questions to ask when making your goals measurable is how will I
					know
					when it is accomplished.<br />The same question applies to your project.<br />How will you know when
					it’s done?<br />Only in this case, you want to ask how will I know when it’s successfully
					accomplished.<br />You can measure to determine your project’s success in a similar way to measuring
					a
					goal.<br />So go through your project goals and deliverables, review the scope, and identify the
					measurable aspects of your project.<br />These are going to be any of the metrics used in the goals
					and
					deliverables along with your budget and schedule details.<br />Another thing you’ll need to do is
					get
					clarity from stakeholders on the project requirements and expectations.<br />This is key.<br />There
					are
					lots of people involved with any project, and that means lots of ideas about what success looks like
					to
					each person.<br />You want to ask questions such as who ultimately says whether or not the project
					is
					successful, what criteria will be measured to determine success, what’s the success of this project
					based on.<br />Once you’ve collected clarifying information, document and share all of it so that
					you,
					your team, and your stakeholders can refer to it later.<br />Let’s try creating success criteria
					with
					the Office Green project.<br />For example, the goal is to increase revenue by 5% by the end of the
					year.<br />One of the deliverables is a website with a gallery of the different plant selections
					that
					are offered.<br />It’s not enough just to make a list of criteria.<br />You need a process for
					measuring
					success from start to finish throughout the entire project lifecycle.<br />This way you can make
					adjustments and ensure success by the time you’re ready to land.<br />There are many metrics you can
					use, and for some products, it will make sense to use more than one.<br />The metrics you choose
					should
					be as closely aligned to your project goal as possible.<br />For example, happiness metrics measure
					user
					attitudes and satisfaction or perceived ease of use.<br />And you can measure these through
					surveys.<br />For the plant pals project, we may consider a customer satisfaction rate of 85% within
					the
					first three months of launching as a way to measure success.<br />You can also consider customer
					adoption and engagement metrics along with more business oriented metrics that track things like
					sales
					and growth.<br />Adoption refers to how the customer uses and adopts a product or service without
					any
					issues.<br />Engagement refers to how often or meaningful customer interaction and participation is
					over
					time.<br />Adoption metrics might include launching a new product to a group of users and having a
					high
					amount of them use or adopted.<br />Engagement metrics might include increasing the daily usage of a
					design feature or increasing orders and customer interactions.<br />Using the office screen example,
					tracking how many customers initially sign up for and use the Plant Pal service is an adoption
					metric.<br />Tracking how many customers renew their plant service, post about it, or share feedback
					are
					engagement metrics.<br />Once you’ve defined the metrics that you’ll be measuring, think about how
					you
					track these metrics.<br />Evaluate which tools can help you collect the data you need to ensure
					you’re
					staying on track.<br />For example, if you’re measuring business metrics like revenue, consider
					tracking
					that in a spreadsheet or dashboard where you can easily spot gaps and trends.<br />If you’re
					measuring
					customer satisfaction, you can think of a way to incentivize customers to participate in regular
					email
					surveys and create a system to measure their responses when they participate.<br />You can also
					utilize
					your project management tools to check on efficiency metrics like what of tasks are completed or
					whether
					the project is progressing alongside the planned timelines.<br />It’s smart to measure success with
					your
					team, as a project or product is in progress.<br />For example, you can hold a project review once a
					month, have team members complete tasks checklist by certain deadlines, or hold life feedback
					sessions
					with your users or customers.<br />There are many different ways to measure success.<br />The key is
					to
					pick the methods that work best for your success criteria.<br />It’s a good idea that along with
					each
					success criteria on your list to also include the methods for how success will be measured, how
					often
					it’s measured, and who’s responsible for measuring it.<br />Share your success criteria document
					with
					your stakeholders and ask if they agree with how the project success will be determined.<br />It’s
					also
					a good idea to have the appropriate stakeholders sign off on the success criteria.<br />This way
					everyone will be clear on who is responsible for which tasks, and you’ll all thoroughly understand
					what
					the path to success entails.<br />Keep this documentation visible throughout the duration of the
					project
					and clearly communicate it with your team every step of the way.<br />They’re the ones who will be
					attempting to meet all the different requirements, so don’t keep them in the dark about what they’re
					supposed to do or how they’re supposed to do it.<br />If done correctly, defining your success
					criteria
					should create greater alignment within the team and give everybody better visibility into how to
					achieve
					success.<br />Clarity around success metrics also helps teams prioritize which efforts are most
					impactful to their users.<br />Defining project success is a complex but crucial part of project
					management.<br />With more and more practice, this process will come more natural to you in the
					planning
					stages and throughout your project.<br />ROWENA: Congratulations on finishing this video in the
