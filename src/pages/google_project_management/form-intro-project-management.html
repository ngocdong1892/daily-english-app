				<p id="1cf468a0-53d4-81df-b287-d85a1bc7457a" class="">Hi.<br />We’re so excited that you’re
					here.<br />I’m
					Emilio, and I’m a program manager on the Responsible /rɪˈspɑːnsəbl/ Innovation /ˌɪnəˈveɪʃn/ team
					here at
					Google.<br />And I’d like to officially /əˈfɪʃəli/ welcome you to Google’s Certificate /sərˈtɪfɪkət/
					Program in project management.<br />Let’s start with a simple exercise.<br />Take a moment and think
					about some of the different tasks that you’ve completed in your life.<br />Maybe you planned your
					wedding or a birthday party, or you filed your annual /ˈænjuəl/ tax returns.<br />Maybe you moved
					from
					one state to another, or maybe you’re the family member who somehow every year is tasked with
					organizing
					/ˈɔːrɡənaɪz/ the annual family reunion /ˌriːˈjuːniən/.<br />Believe it or not, you’ve been
					developing
					all kinds of skills through these tasks that will help you become a successful project manager for
					any
					organization or your own business.<br />With this program in project management by Google, we’ve put
					together a set of courses, activities, quizzes /kwɪz/, and exercises that will teach you the
					fundamentals /ˌfʌndəˈmentl/ of project management and, of course, help you get a job or advance in
					your
					career.<br />Wondering how I started my own career in project management?<br />Well, in college I
					always
					gravitated /ˈɡrævɪteɪt/ towards things that were more hands on and action oriented /ɔːrientɪd/ and
					less
					theoretical /ˌθiːəˈretɪkl/.<br />I wanted to make an impact in whichever /wɪtʃˈevər/ career I took
					on.<br />So my first job out of college was as a Spanish and leadership teacher in Los Angeles,
					California.<br />My main objective in guiding the student leadership team at the school was to
					identify
					/aɪˈdentɪfaɪ/, mobilize /ˈməʊbəlaɪz/, and inspire /ɪnˈspaɪər/ the student leaders.<br />After two
					years
					of teaching, I realized that the moments when I felt the most energized /ˈenərdʒaɪz/ were when I was
					building a vision for how to get a big project done, or when I was working to bring different groups
					together around a common goal.<br />That’s when I realized I had a lot of core project management
					skills
					and I could focus on growing and developing them in the business world.<br />I’m grateful /ˈɡreɪtfl/
					that I get to be here for the start of your journey /ˈdʒɜːrni.<br />When I was first starting to
					think
					about my career, project management wasn’t even on my radar /ˈreɪdɑːr/.<br />It was one of those
					professions /prəˈfeʃn/ that I didn’t even know existed until I entered the business world and
					experienced how great of a need there is for folks who are organized, action oriented, diligent
					/ˈdɪlɪdʒənt/, and strategic /strəˈtiːdʒɪk/.<br />I hope that by the end of this program you’ll be as
					excited as I am about the prospects /ˈprɑːspekt/ of a career in project management.<br />Let’s get
					into
					it.<br />We’ll start with an important question.<br />What exactly is project
					management?<br />Project
					management is the application of knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to meet the project
					requirements and achieve the desired /dɪˈzaɪər/ outcome.<br />It’s possible that you’ve been project
					managing every day on some level without even knowing it.<br />In this course, you’ll learn how to
					hone
					those skills to become a truly great project manager.<br />And the awesome /ˈɔːsəm/ thing about
					project
					management is that it spans a lot of industries and company types.<br />And it doesn’t require deep
					technical knowledge.<br />This means that any job or life experience you’ve gained so far will help
					you
					in building those skills to become successful in a project management career.<br />There are a lot
					of
					people around the world like you who are hoping to learn the skills to get a project management
					role.<br />Whatever your reason for being here, we’re glad you’ve joined us.<br />This program is
					rooted
					/ˈruːtɪd/ in a belief that a strong foundation /faʊnˈdeɪʃn/ in project management can help anyone
					start
					a great career as a project manager.<br />This program includes six industry relevant /ˈreləvənt/
					courses that focus on topics like project management fundamentals /ˌfʌndəˈmentl/; goals, objectives,
					and
					deliverables /dɪˈlɪvərəbl/; risk management; team dynamics; project management methodologies
					/ˌmeθəˈdɑːlədʒi/; data-driven decision making; and more.<br />Each course is made up of personal
					anecdotes /ˈænɪkdəʊt/, reading materials, quizzes, and case studies.<br />And you can go through the
					program at your own pace, skip the sections that you might already know, and review the videos again
					if
					you need a refresher.<br />You’ll be doing a lot of hands-on learning.<br />You’ll build project
					plans
					and timelines.<br />You’ll learn how to manage budgets /ˈbʌdʒɪt/ and meet the needs of the people
					involved /ɪnˈvɑːlvd/ in the project.<br />And you’ll learn different project methodologies
					/ˌmeθəˈdɑːlədʒi/ like agile, scrum, and waterfall.<br />You’ll use tools like kanban and learn about
					project management software like Asana.<br />You’ll also develop your soft skills, some of which you
					likely already have.<br />Don’t worry, even if you aren’t quite sure how to tap into them yet, we’ll
					explore which skills are transferable to a project management role.<br />Above all, this program
					will
					help get you ready for a new job.<br />But we’re taking it one step further.<br />When you complete
					this
					program, you’ll have the opportunity to share your work with Google and other top employers aiming
					/eɪm/
					to hire project management professionals /prəˈfeʃənl/.<br />And the best part is you’ll have
					professional work examples you can share with them to showcase what you’ve learned.<br />Along the
					way,
					you’ll hear from Google employees like me.<br />We’ll share personal stories about how we became
					project
					managers and how our foundations in project management launched /lɔːntʃ/ our careers.<br />We’ll
					also
					share what we do at work every day and give you tips for job interviews.<br />We’ve got a truly
					amazing
					group of course instructors /ɪnˈstrʌktər/ for you to learn from.<br />Ready to meet
					them?<br />JUANNE:
