				<p id="1cf468a0-53d4-8168-87be-e084bacc07f0" class="">ELITA: Hi, there.<br />If you’ve gone through our
					previous courses, you’ve spend a lot of time digging into the intricacies and significance of
					setting up
					a project for success.<br />And now we’re at the project execution stage, where all of that hard
					work
					comes together.<br />If you haven’t gone through our previous courses yet, we recommend checking
					them
					out.<br />Before we get started, let me introduce myself.<br />My name is Elita and I’ll be your
					instructor for this course.<br />I work as a senior engineering program manager at Google, where I
					currently lead the team behind routing and navigation on Google Maps.<br />I joined the company in
					2007,
					working on teams across Google’s engineering organization in New York, London, and Seattle.<br />And
					in
					2013, I joined the Google Maps team and launched popular features like holiday hours and attributes
					on
					businesses, while leading global teams from New York to Sydney to Hyderabad.<br />Generally, I like
					solving problems and learning new things.<br />Every new project and team allows me to do
					both.<br />I’m
					excited to lead you through this course and demonstrate how to put a project plan into
					action.<br />First up, you’ll learn more about risks and unforeseen changes to the project.<br />If
					you’ve taken our previous courses, you might recall that change is inevitable.<br />And to combat
					that,
					we’ve covered the concept of risk mitigation during the planning phase.<br />And now we’ll take it
					one
					step further and discuss what to do when a risk actually materializes.<br />Next, I’ll discuss
					tracking
					and quality.<br />You’ll learn how to track and measure your project’s progress and you’ll learn how
					to
					use continuous improvement and quality management techniques to keep the project on track and
					running
					smoothly.<br />These best practices are valuable to just about any role and I’m looking forward to
					taking you through them.<br />Other big aspects of running a project include
					decision-making.<br />You’ll learn to both use and analyze data to inform your decision-making and
					then,
					in turn, use that data to explore and explain key aspects of your project.<br />I’ll also discuss
					team
					management and the fundamentals of influencing.<br />So much of the success of a project relies on
					teamwork.<br />And you’ll learn more about how you, as a project manager, can effectively lead your
					team
					to the finish line.<br />Speaking of teamwork, I’ll share some of the tools that provide effective
					team
					communication, along with tips for organizing and facilitating meetings.<br />And then we’ll wrap up
					by
					discussing how to close a project.<br />You’ll learn the steps required to finish a project and the
					importance of celebrating a job well done with your team.<br />Sounds kind of fun, right?<br />After
					all
					that planning this is the point in the project lifecycle where work gets done and everything comes
					together.<br />Ready to get started?<br />Meet me in the next video, where you’ll learn about the
					importance of tracking and measuring project progress.<br />[MUSIC PLAYING] In previous courses,
					we’ve
					discussed the importance of breaking your project down into milestones and tasks, and assigning
					those
					tasks to different members of your team.<br />We’ve also discussed setting a schedule and
					budget.<br />But once the project execution phase gets going, how do you actually know that the work
					is
					getting done?<br />Well you can do this in a few ways.<br />But primarily, you can keep tabs on
					project
					progress by tracking and measurement.<br />This is actually a big part of project
					management.<br />Tracking, by definition, is a method of following the progress of a project’s
					activities.<br />Measuring project performance regularly, to identify deviations from the project
					plan,
					can help ensure that the project stays on track.<br />A deviation is anything that alters your
					original
					course of action.<br />Deviations from the project plan can be positive or negative.<br />Are you
					ahead
					of schedule because a technical problem is less complex than you estimated?<br />Thumbs up.<br />Did
					a
					natural disaster shut down your testing team?<br />Big thumbs down.<br />Both of these are examples
					of
					deviations.<br />They’re also examples of why tracking is such a crucial part of your role during
					the
					project execution phase.<br />Let’s examine some of the ways that tracking is beneficial for your
					project success.<br />To start, tracking makes key project information transparent and transparency
					is
					essential for accurate decision-making.<br />Even the strongest project managers make poor decisions
					when they lack information or context.<br />Tracking centralizes project information so that
					everyone
					can understand the status of each part of the project, which can then help you identify gaps in your
					knowledge.<br />Also projects have so many little details.<br />It’s hard to keep everything
					straight.<br />Tracking helps ensure that you don’t risk forgetting something.<br />Second, tracking
					helps keep all team members and stakeholders in touch with deadlines and goals.<br />To ensure that
					everyone has visibility into project progress, you should have a project plan that works both for
					you
					and your team.<br />This way you’re all on the same page about how the project is
					progressing.<br />You’ll learn about different ways to track a project later in this
					module.<br />Tracking is also crucial for recognizing risks and issues that can derail your
					progress.<br />With effective tracking, you’ll be able to identify issues in a timely fashion and
					work
					with your team to take corrective action.<br />By providing visibility into the various parts of the
					project, tracking helps you and your team identify and focus on areas at risk.<br />And finally,
					tracking helps build confidence that the project is set to be delivered on time, in scope and within
					budget.<br />Having a clear, up-to-date picture of the overall project status keeps the team
					motivated
					and focused on staying the course.<br />So to recap, tracking is important for a few key reasons,
					like
					transparency, risk management and keeping the project on track.<br />Coming up, we’ll take you
					through
					some of the key items to track during project execution.<br />Meet you there.<br />[MUSIC PLAYING]
					So
					we’ve discussed that tracking monitors the progress of project activities.<br />But you may still be
					wondering, what specifically should you be tracking?<br />I’ll take you through a few of the most
					commonly tracked items that I find helpful when managing projects at Google.<br />First, you should
					always track the project schedule.<br />This is made up of tasks and activities that ensure that the
					project is effectively heading toward its completion date.<br />After all, your ultimate goal is to
					complete your deliverables on time.<br />Equally important is tracking the status of action items,
					key
					tasks and activities to ensure that work is actually getting done.<br />Tracking tasks also helps to
					track your team’s progress toward milestones.<br />We learned a bit more about tracking progress
					toward
					milestones earlier in the course.<br />And we stressed the importance of creating tasks and
					milestones
					to keep everyone on track.<br />When you’re in the middle of a project, new tasks will come up all
					the
					time.<br />In order to avoid missing deadlines, it’s imperative to track tasks as they progress and
					as
					you approach key milestones.<br />Next, you’ll also need to track costs to ensure that you don’t
					overspend or underspend on project tasks.<br />As I mentioned earlier, all projects have
					budgets.<br />And whether or not you’re overseeing the entire budget, you may be overseeing tasks
					and
					resources that have budget implications.<br />And finally, you’ll need to track key decisions,
					changes,
					dependencies and risks to the project, including any agreed upon scope changes.<br />This way, your
					team
					and stakeholders are aligned on what needs to be done for the project to succeed.<br />We will cover
					this in more detail throughout the course, since it’s a big part of running the project.<br />To
					recap,
					the items that are helpful to track throughout the project execution phase include the project
					schedule,
					which contain the key tasks and activities, the status of action items, progress toward milestones,
					costs and key decisions and changes.<br />There are many moving parts to be aware of, once a project
					is
					underway.<br />Tracking them closely benefits you and your team, as you head toward the project
					goal.<br />I’ve taken you through an introduction to tracking.<br />And coming up, we’ll discuss
					project
					management tools and templates you can use to track project activities.<br />[MUSIC PLAYING] Now
					that
					you understand how essential tracking is, let’s explore and compare various types of tracking
					methods.<br />The purpose of your project plan is to guide you through the execution of your
					project.<br />Therefore, it will always include at least one type of tracking method, and sometimes
					you
					might use more than one, depending on what your team needs.<br />The tracking methods we’ll discuss
					in
					this video are a GANTT Chart, a Roadmap and a Burndown chart.<br />There are many others, but these
					are
					the few that I’m going to focus on.<br />Whichever type you choose depends on what you deem suitable
					for
					your project.<br />It’s important to remember to select something that the entire team can easily
					understand, reference and keep up to date.<br />Let’s compare the tracking methods I
					mentioned.<br />Perhaps the most common tracking method of all is the GANTT Chart.<br />It’s a tried
					and
					true tool to keep your project on track.<br />A GANTT Chart measures tasks against time and includes
					useful information, like who will own each task and what the order of the tasks should be.<br />For
					this
					reason, it’s a useful chart for staying on schedule and for projects with many dependencies, or
					tasks,
					or activities or milestones that are reliant on one another.<br />It’s also a helpful chart for
					teams
					with a lot of people, because ownership and responsibilities are explicitly laid out
					visually.<br />As
					you track and move along sequentially over time, this starts to look like a waterfall, hence why
					GANTT
					Charts are commonly used in waterfall project management.<br />Each task is represented by a
					horizontal
					progress bar and the length of the bar is dependent on how much time is allotted to the
					task.<br />The
					bars are stacked on top of each other to denote that the task at the top must be completed before
					the
					next one below it can be completed.<br />GANTT Charts typically live in your project plan and are
					updated as the project progresses.<br />Another common tracking method we have here at Google is a
					Roadmap.<br />A Roadmap is best suited for when you need a way to track big milestones in your
					project.<br />It’s useful for illustrating how a project should evolve over time to a team and key
					stakeholders.<br />Here’s an example.<br />A Roadmap might list your project’s goals at the top and
					a
					description of the approach you’ll be taking to meet those goals.<br />In this example, the goals
					are to
					increase online business-to-consumer sales by 20% year over year, and to increase holiday sales to
					existing customers by 8% over last year.<br />The approach details the main tactics your team will
					use
					to reach your goal.<br />A Roadmap also includes a high level project overview.<br />High level, in
					this
					context, means a concise summary, usually three to four sentences to clearly state the objectives
					and
					priorities for your project.<br />Below the goals, approach and overview is a table that maps out
					what
					the process will entail.<br />In this example, our table is divided into quarters that reflect the
					project timeline.<br />A quarter is a three-month period on a company’s financial calendar.<br />Key
					milestones are listed for each quarter.<br />Then there are tasks that each team member or
					department
					needs to complete.<br />Most tasks may map to a milestone due within the same quarter.<br />In our
					example, the project as a whole has a key milestone, in Q1, to finalize inventory for the holiday
					season.<br />The work of product testing and finalizing suggestions for offerings mainly falls to
					the
					marketing and sales teams.<br />However, sometimes the tasks may need to be completed in advance to
					unblock another team or milestone in future quarters.<br />The product and engineering team is
					working
					on tasks in Q1 and in Q2 that lead up to the launch of the refreshed online store in Q3.<br />In
					order
					to reach that milestone, each department needs to complete specific tasks.<br />And the Roadmap
					tracks
					both individual and project progress toward milestones.<br />Finally, there’s the Burndown chart,
					the
					most granular of the three tracking methods.<br />A Burndown chart measures time against the amount
					of
					work done and the amount of work remaining.<br />Their main uses are to keep the project team on top
					of
					targeted completion dates and to keep the team aware of scope creep as it occurs.<br />Burndown
					charts
					are best suited for projects that require a detailed, broken down review of each task associated
					with a
					project.<br />And they’re great for projects where finishing on time is the top priority.<br />The
					Y-axis, or the vertical axis, symbolizes the number of tasks left to complete.<br />And the X-axis,
					or
					the horizontal axis, signifies time.<br />Progress gets tracked from the upper left hand corner of
					the
					chart.<br />As the project goes along, you’ll track down, working your way toward zero remaining
					tasks,
					and to the right, working your way toward your end date.<br />There’s typically a dotted line for
					your
					expected or projected progress, based on the rate your team is expected to close tasks, and a solid
					line
					representing your actual progress.<br />Before you continue on with your project, you’ll need to
					decide
					which tracker makes the most sense.<br />If you need to communicate milestones to a large team, you
					might choose a Roadmap.<br />If you have a project with multiple dependencies, you might choose a
					GANTT
					Chart.<br />If tracking tasks against your deadline is especially important, then the Burndown chart
					might be your best option.<br />And you may even decide to use more than one.<br />Because the
					tracking
					method will be determined by the type of project you’re working on, your resources and the project
					scope, you’ll probably end up using several types of tracking methods at some point in your
					career.<br />In my time at Google, I’ve regularly combined methods and used a few different types
					together.<br />For example, using a GANTT Chart to scope work at the beginning of a project, then
					switching to a Burndown chart in the weeks before a launch to make sure we’re good to go.<br />Now
					you
					know a bit more about the various types of tracking methods, including a Roadmap, GANTT Chart and
					Burndown chart.<br />Next up, we’ll focus on understanding continuous improvement and process
					improvement.<br />[MUSIC PLAYING] In this module, we’ll learn why risks and changes might occur
					during a
					project and how that can impact your project’s scope.<br />You may remember that a risk is a
					potential
					event that might occur and could impact your project.<br />When you think about risks in the context
					of
					project management, you’ll think about them as hypothetical.<br />In other words, these might not be
					events that will definitely happen, but because there’s a possibility that they could happen, it’s
					your
					responsibility, as a project manager, to identify and plan for those risks.<br />Let’s revisit some
					examples of risks.<br />A project risk might be a contractor missing a deadline, or introducing a
					tool
					that may lead to communication breakdown within your team, or unexpected additional work because of
					an
					unforeseen policy being put in place.<br />When any risk occurs, the consequence is a change to the
					project plan.<br />A change is anything that alters or impacts the tasks, structures or processes
					within
					a project.<br />Changes are typically unexpected.<br />More often than not, they have a negative
					impact
					on the project and you’ll have to learn to navigate that.<br />But sometimes– and I’m placing a
					heavy
					emphasis on sometimes– changes can have a positive impact.<br />Changes can encompass any variance
					from
					the original project plan, in regards to the triple constraint.<br />This may entail changing
					priorities
					in scope, budgeting resources or changes to the project timeline.<br />We’ll discuss how the
					internal
					and external dependencies of a project impact each other and bring about change.<br />Let’s go
					through a
					few types of changes that can affect your project.<br />Some examples of changes may include new or
					changing dependencies.<br />Dependencies are tasks, activities or milestones that are reliant on one
					another.<br />So if one task isn’t completed on time, it may put your other tasks behind.<br />You
					might
					be in charge of renovations on a home where there are dependencies.<br />In a bathroom remodel, for
					instance, a new sink cannot be installed until the vanity and plumbing are in place.<br />Next is
					changing priorities.<br />The scope of the remodel changes if your client’s in-laws suddenly have to
					move in, and you have to move up planned work on the spare bedroom before completing the bathroom
					remodel.<br />Next up, the capacity and people available could change.<br />Maybe you have to
					replace
					the plumber because you had issues on the jobsite.<br />Another type of change could include a new
					limitation on your budget or resources.<br />For example, you need to reduce design costs in the new
					bathroom by 10% because your quotes for electrical work come in higher than expected.<br />Another
					change could be scope creep.<br />Scope creep is when changes, growth and other factors affect the
					project scope.<br />For instance, your clients are so happy with the tile in the new bathroom, that
					they’d like to replace the tile in all of their bathrooms.<br />And finally, force
					majeure.<br />This is
					another change that could occur due to a national or international crisis.<br />If you aren’t
					familiar
					with this term, it means an unforeseen circumstance that prevents someone from fulfilling the
					contract,
					due to a major crisis.<br />Force majeure is pretty uncommon, but for instance, if a union goes on
					strike, certain vendors won’t be able to fulfill their contracts.<br />If there is a pandemic, all
					production on your new product might be halted.<br />Changes should be measured against the baseline
					estimates of scope, budget and time allotted for your project, given the original
					requirements.<br />Be
					mindful that when you change any one of those things, there may be knock on effects, which could be
					positive or negative.<br />For instance, your clients may believe they have beautiful hardwood
					floors
					hiding underneath old living room carpet, and want to pull up the old carpet and use the original
					hardwood floors underneath.<br />You, the project manager on this particular construction job, have
					budgeted to have the carpet removed and the old floor is sanded and stained.<br />Bad news– you pull
					up
					the carpet and find that the floors are in bad shape and rotting.<br />They’ll need to be replaced
					or
					repaired which could be costly.<br />So your timeline and budget are likely to take a hit.<br />When
					it
					comes to who takes on the responsibility of managing the changing scope, it’ll be you, the project
					manager.<br />But depending on the project, you probably won’t do it alone.<br />In order to
					properly
					manage changes, you’ll want to refer to documents, like your statement of work and the RACI
					chart.<br />But you might also have to create some new documentation.<br />You want to create or
					familiarize yourself with the processes for requesting changes for your team or
					organization.<br />These
					processes might include a change request form.<br />Let’s discuss change request forms.<br />You and
					your stakeholders will use these forms in order to stay on top of, and adequately manage, any
					changes.<br />Since a lot of people with different roles on the project can fill out these forms,
					it’s
					important for the forms to be self-explanatory and very thorough.<br />In the provided template,
					which
					uses a 2x10 table, you’ll need to include information in the cells, such as the project name, the
					discussion owner, who’s taking the lead on this discussion from the team, discussion
					type.<br />You’ll
					want to let your audience know if you’ll be discussing a risk, opportunity or anything
					else.<br />You’ll
					want to identify the teams involved and the expected outcome of the discussion, which might be a
					change
					in priorities, schedule change or an official call on how to proceed with an issue.<br />Add the
					target
					date for discussion and identify which milestones or goals might be impacted.<br />Provide a short
					description of the current situation, the change and any difference you expect to make to the plan
					of
					record, like a snapshot of the before and after.<br />Then go into in-depth proposal for the
					necessary
					changes and address any trade offs.<br />And finally, provide any background information, so that
					everyone shares the same context.<br />You can also refer to your statement of work, or SOW, for
					more
					information about who needs to be involved in that conversation.<br />If you find that one or more
					of
					your milestones are at risk of not being completed, then you’ll need to get a customer sign-off
					before
					the scope deadline or budget are changed, and all parties involved need to be informed.<br />Great
					work.<br />We’ve reviewed how to define risk and know more about how to identify the reasons why
					risks
					and changes might occur during a project.<br />And now we can explain the impact of increasing a
					project
					scope.<br />In the next– [MUSIC PLAYING] So we’ve covered risks and how they affect a
					project.<br />But
					we haven’t fully discussed dependencies, arguably one of the biggest factors in a project.<br />In
					this
					video, we’ll discuss dependencies, both internal and external, how to identify and track them, as
					well
					as their importance.<br />There are a few different types of dependencies and we’ll discuss a few
					examples of each one.<br />So what exactly are dependencies?<br />Dependencies are the links that
					connect one project task to another.<br />And as we mentioned, they’re often the greatest source of
					risk
					to a project.<br />Two or more project tasks may have a relationship with one another, in which the
					completion of one task is reliant on the initiation of another task, and vise versa.<br />Think of
					these
					tasks like a line of dominoes, toppling each other over, one by one.<br />If one domino falls, it’ll
					knock the next one over, and so on and so on.<br />For instance, a construction company may have a
					number of jobs across the city.<br />Each project requires a foreman and a project manager to be
					chosen
					before the requirements, timeline and budget gets signed off, and the crew is chosen.<br />You
					wouldn’t
					choose a crew and tell them to get to work before the work has been clearly scoped and the contracts
					were signed.<br />That’s an example of an internal dependency, which describes the relationship
					between
					two tasks within the same project.<br />External dependencies, on the other hand, refer to tasks
					that
					are reliant on outside factors, like regulatory agencies or other projects.<br />For instance, if a
					construction company is scheduled to demolish a building site, they’ll have to wait until their
					project
					is approved by the city.<br />External dependencies aren’t always in the project manager’s control,
					but
					it’s important to be aware of them so that the project stays on track.<br />Mandatory dependencies
					are
					tasks that are legally or contractually required.<br />For instance, when that construction company
					finishes the demolition and starts the rebuild, they’ll first have to pour a concrete foundation and
					then have it inspected by the city to ensure it meets their standards, before the construction
					company
					can continue to build.<br />Lastly, discretionary dependencies are defined by the project
					team.<br />These are dependencies that could occur on their own, but the team saw a need to make
					those
					dependencies reliant on one another.<br />For instance, the construction company may be using
					concrete
					from a new supplier and want to run a test, pouring a portion of the foundation to get a better
					estimate
					of the total amount of product they’ll need to complete the foundation, rather than buying too much
					or
					too little product upfront.<br />The task of pouring a portion of the foundation comes first,
					because
					the team needed more information before making a decision.<br />A project manager has to work
					diligently
					to incorporate dependency management.<br />Dependency management is the process of managing all of
					these
					interrelated tasks and resources within the project to ensure that your overall project is completed
					successfully, on time and in budget.<br />To pursue effective dependency management, there are four
					important steps that a project manager can take– proper identification, recording dependencies,
					continuous monitoring and control, and efficient communication.<br />The first step is proper
					identification.<br />A project manager will have to brainstorm all possible project dependencies
					with
					their team and categorize them accordingly.<br />Next step is recording dependencies.<br />After all
					dependencies are identified, a risk register should be created.<br />A risk register is a table or
					chart
					that contains your list of risks and dependencies.<br />The risk register should include a
					description
					of the dependency, the date and all activities or tasks that may be impacted by the
					dependency.<br />Then, a project manager will want to maintain continuous monitoring and
					control.<br />This means you will want to schedule regular meetings to check in on the interrelated
					tasks, staying up to date on any progress being made and double checking for changes that will
					impact
					other tasks.<br />Last step is efficient communication.<br />Keeping the project team and
					stakeholders
					updated can help resolve dependencies and keep the project going strong.<br />To recap, we just
					discussed how to define dependencies, both internal and external.<br />And we learned the importance
					of
					managing and tracking dependencies.<br />We also discussed the importance of clearly defining
					dependencies at the project outset, like in our foundation example, and learned about dependency
					management.<br />[MUSIC PLAYING] Earlier, we talked at length about identifying and managing
					risks.<br />Risk management is absolutely critical to a project’s success.<br />So in this video,
					we’ll
					introduce additional techniques for managing risks.<br />Let’s start with a reminder of the
					definition
					of risk management.<br />Risk management is the process of identifying potential risks and issues
					which
					could impact a project, then evaluating and applying steps to address the effects of the identified
					risks and issues.<br />One way to manage risks– and hopefully prevent any risks from materializing–
					is
					to focus on managing the changes and dependencies, as well as any scope creep in your
					project.<br />If
					you can manage those two things, both changes and dependencies, and scope creep, other types of
					risks
					become much easier to manage.<br />If your dependencies are met on time, your team is less likely to
					fall behind schedule.<br />If your scope is tightly managed, you’re less likely to incur changes to
					your
					budget or be forced to extend your timeline.<br />Brainstorming with your team is one of the most
					effective techniques for identifying risks in a project.<br />Your teammates likely bring skills and
					experience from previous projects, which can help suss out similarities and keep you from repeating
					any
					issues.<br />As we brainstorm with our team, it’s best to create a risk register.<br />As a
					refresher, a
					risk register is a table or chart that contains your team’s list of risks.<br />You’ll want to pose
					questions to your team like, what could improve the outcome of the project?<br />Or what could hurt
					or
					hinder it?<br />You’ll list them all as if then statements.<br />For example, if a given event
					happens,
					then here’s how the project is impacted.<br />To help prioritize risks within your risk register,
					you
					can calculate your risk exposure.<br />Risk exposure is a way to measure the potential future loss
					resulting from a specific activity or event.<br />A good method to calculate risk exposure is to
					build a
					matrix like this one.<br />When building out your matrix, you’ll use two variables, risk impact and
					probability.<br />Write “risk impact” at the top horizontal axis and write “probability” on the side
					vertical axis.<br />Mark “high,” “medium” and “low” along each axis as well, across the top from
					left to
					right, and down the side from top to bottom.<br />Because that’s how you’re going to chart risk
					exposure.<br />Add each risk to the chart at the cross-section of the impact the risk might have on
					your
					project, and probability or likelihood of the risk coming to pass.<br />This is one technique, but
					whatever strategy you use to examine your risk exposure, your risks will need to be prioritized so
					that
					you know and your team knows which ones to give immediate attention to.<br />For anything that has a
					high impact on your project, even if it has a low probability of occurring, make sure to have a
					mitigation plan in place.<br />How will you handle this risk if it actually materializes?<br />While
					the
					risk register is a great tool, it’s still likely that some unforeseen risk will arise.<br />It’s
					almost
					impossible to account for every single risk over the course of a project.<br />That’s where the ROAM
					technique can help.<br />The ROAM technique, which stands for resolved, owned, accepted and
					mitigated,
					is used to help manage actions after risks arise.<br />Once a risk has materialized, you need to
					decide
					what to do with it.<br />If a risk has been eliminated and will not be a problem, it goes into your
					resolved category.<br />If you give a team member ownership over a certain risk and entrust them to
					handle it, that risk goes into the owned category and is monitored through to completion.<br />If
					the
					risk has been accepted, it has been agreed that nothing will be done about it.<br />Finally, if some
					action has been taken, such that the risk has been mitigated, either reducing the likelihood of it
					occurring or reducing the impact to the project, it goes into the mitigated category.<br />After
					each
					risk is placed into a category, the team will discuss each risk and decide which should be
					prioritized.<br />Awesome.<br />Now you’ve learned a bit more about how to differentiate risks and
					issues, as well as some new techniques to manage various risks.<br />[MUSIC PLAYING] Hi
					again.<br />In
					this video, we’re going to learn about a common strategy used to resolve problems in a
					project.<br />On
					top of several other tasks, it’s a project manager’s responsibility to resolve problems and remove
					constraints that are a detriment to the project success.<br />One way to do this is to
					escalate.<br />Escalation is the process of enlisting the help of higher level project leadership or
					management to remove an obstacle, clarify or reinforce priorities and validate next
					steps.<br />Escalation may seem to have a negative connotation, but that’s not the case in project
					management.<br />In project management escalation should be encouraged, used often and even
					celebrated.<br />Escalations are healthy, and act as a kind of checks and balances tool to make sure
					appropriate action is being taken.<br />They can result in speedy decision making and generally, the
					quicker a problem is resolved, the better off a project will be.<br />Instead of going back and
					forth
					between two team members who can’t agree, an objective third party might help make the call and
					reduce
					frustrations within the team.<br />Finally, escalations encourage participation.<br />Encouraging
					others
					to participate in solving or owning problems can promote trust and shared responsibility among
					teammates, which are signs of a healthy, functional team.<br />Before starting work on a project,
					the
					project manager, the team and the project sponsor should establish escalation standards and
					practices.<br />This means they’ll specify who the issues will be raised to, how issues are raised
					and
					the forum for discussion.<br />A little upfront work will help escalations run smoothly when and if
					they
					are needed.<br />So you know what an escalation is and when to set the framework for managing
					escalations.<br />But how do you know when to escalate?<br />A project manager should escalate an
					issue
					at the first sign of critical problems in the project.<br />Critical problems are issues that may
					cause
					a delay to a major project milestone, issues that cause budget overruns, issues that can result in
					the
					loss of a customer, and issues that push back the estimated project completion date.<br />Basically
					anything that will affect your triple constraint– time, budget and scope– is something that should
					be
					escalated.<br />Escalation is great for preventing two common issues within a project– trench wars
					and
					bad compromises.<br />Trench wars occur when two peers or groups can’t seem to come to an agreement
					and
					neither party is willing to give in.<br />This leads to a standstill in the project and will likely
					delay certain aspects of the project’s progress.<br />Typically, we think of compromises as a
					positive
					way to resolve issues.<br />But there is such a thing as a bad compromise.<br />A bad compromise
					occurs
					when two parties settle on a so-called solution, but the end product still suffers.<br />When it
					comes
					to compromising on important project goals, it’s not productive for either party to settle simply
					because it’s a means to an end.<br />Yes, compromise, while also keeping the larger project goals in
					mind and working towards those together.<br />You may have to help your team or stakeholders make
					hard
					choices for the greater good.<br />So now we’ve defined escalation, how to use the triple
					constraints
					model when communicating to stakeholders and negotiating changes, and we learned about trench wars
					and
					bad compromises, which are two common issues on a project.<br />[MUSIC PLAYING] You’ve probably come
					to
					an understanding that effective communication leads to positive outcomes in every aspect of your
					life.<br />The same is true for communicating changes in projects.<br />Communicating change to
					project
					team members and stakeholders isn’t just a matter of keeping your tracking documents up to
					date.<br />Even the smallest changes will be meaningful to someone on your team and should be
					communicated.<br />It’s also true that you’ll need to tailor your communication tactics based on the
					subject matter and recipient.<br />As a project manager, sometimes you’re going to want to have a
					meeting with your whole team, while other times, an email might suffice.<br />Personally, I prefer
					having a quick coffee or hallway chat with my teammates, and then following it up with an email,
					noting
					what we agreed upon.<br />This is particularly useful when you need quick agreement or if the
					subject is
					a little sensitive.<br />How will you know which communication tactic is
					appropriate?<br />Ultimately,
					you’ll have to use your own judgment.<br />But here are some ways you can decide which route to
					take.<br />As a project manager, when communicating a small change that will affect an individual,
					it’s
					a good idea to send an email.<br />Be sure to avoid emotional topics or anything that needs to be
					discussed in depth.<br />Just give them a heads up and set a meeting time.<br />Weekly meetings may
					not
					be necessary, particularly if your agenda is short.<br />If you set a meeting and then decide
					against
					it, you can either pivot to an email or move the topic to a different forum.<br />When there’s a big
					change within your project that impacts more than one person and is likely to change the budget,
					deadline or scope of the project, you’ll probably want to have a team meeting.<br />One useful
					tactic to
					keep in mind, when navigating these changes in your project, is called a timeout.<br />A timeout
					means
					taking a moment away from the project, in order to take a breath, regroup and adjust the game
					plan.<br />A timeout may temporarily disrupt your momentum, but it may be absolutely necessary to
					set
					you up for success in the long run.<br />You may want to take a timeout when the client wants to
					redefine the scope of the project, or if team members get reassigned to other projects and you need
					a
					plan to backfill them.<br />This timeout is a chance for the project team to evaluate the changes so
					they can adjust the plan as needed.<br />Throughout the process, you’ll want to hold meetings in
					order
					to discuss successes, setbacks and possible future improvements to the project.<br />These meetings
					are
					called retrospectives.<br />Retrospectives are held throughout the project’s lifecycle.<br />A
					retrospective focuses on identifying the contributing causes of an incident, or pattern of
					incidents,
					without blaming one individual.<br />While conducting a retrospective, you should always assume that
					everyone has good intentions and did the right thing with the information they had, whether or not
					it
					worked out well in the end.<br />There’s always a chance to learn and do better.<br />As a project
					manager, it’s important to identify effective techniques for communicating changes to an individual
					teammate, or to your whole team.<br />You now know a bit more about taking a timeout, and the idea
					of a
					retrospective to have productive conversations about incidents that arise during your
					project.<br />ROWENA: Congratulations on finishing this video in the Google Project Management
