					English is spoken all over the world.
					But depending on where you go, it can be completely different.
					And sometimes even I can't understand it.
					Now let's check out some of the most interesting English accents.
					Where they come from and why they sound the way they do.
					First stop the United Kingdom.
					Now there is more than one accent.
					In the United Kingdom.
					First, let's check out a more proper English.
					The Queen's English.
					The Queen's English, or Received Pronunciation, as some people call it.
					Is the classic British accent that you hear in the movies.
					It developed among the upper class in London, and it is known for its clear pronunciation.
					Here's an example.
					Today we're looking at two tips to help you sound more British.
					Number one, in British English, the r is not rhotic.
					So that means that sometimes it is not pronounced, it's actually silent or it's a schwa sound.
					Next, there's another accent in the United Kingdom that is not so beautiful.
					Not so polished.
					The Cockney accent.
					It's famous for dropping H's out of words.
					And swapping the t-h for F or V.
					So think sounds like “fink” And brother sounds like “bruv” It comes from the working class
					communities of London.
					And here is an example of the Cockney accent.
					Now, listen, you might think I'm a bit of a dodgy geezer with a Cockney accent, but the thing is, is
					that not everybody in London is going to want to take a six inch knife and try it in your wallet.
					But I might want to suggest keeping your pokies open as you're walking down our street late night
					after the bar's closed.
					Now let's head north to Scotland.
					The Scottish accent was influenced by Scots, a totally separate language from English.
					It has strong R sounds, stronger sounds.
					That was bad guys. Strong.
					That sounds Russian.
					And some words are completely unique.
					Like using the word wee instead of small.
					And can for “know” Shout out some of.
					So Ken is like, no, as an and k and o w, so you say like, you could, Here's an example of a very
					heavy Scottish accent.
					Oh, you need to know that by country.
					You know what I mean? Why not?
					But you shouldn't.
					And I know, I know, it's pretty personally.
					And what about you, brother?
					You see, my mother said Now over to Ireland.
					Ireland. Ireland.
					Where the spoken English was influenced by the Irish language better known as Gaelic.
					and the big city of Dublin.
					You'll hear a softer accent.
					But in the countryside, the accent is much stronger.
					Here's an example.
					So here's an example of an Irish compliment I might give to a lady.
					You're not a bad looking woman.
					Now, Irish women know that if I say that to them, that means I am absolutely awestruck by them,
					right?
					Now let's go down under, mate.
					Down under to Australia.
					And Down under is what they call Australia.
					Because it is at the bottom.
					The bottom of the map or the globe.
					And maybe you don't know this, but originally Australia was used as a prison.
					In the 1700s it was used to house British.
					And Irish convicts.
					And the mixture of those accents eventually became what we know today as the Australian accent.
					And who better to show us the Australian accent than an incredible human being who helped many
					people and so many animals all around the world?
					Steve Irwin. Rest in peace.
					what good is a fast car flash house and a gold plated dunny to me?
					Absolutely no good at all.
					I've been put on this planet to protect wildlife and wilderness areas, which in essence, is going to
					help humanity.
					Now let's head to the Caribbean, man.
					Let's head to the Caribbean. Man.
					May speak a Jamaican real good.
					In Jamaica.
					English is mixed with West African languages.
					And influences from English and French.
					Colonizers.
					Jamaican Patois or Jamaican English.
					Has a distinct rhythm. Dropped consonants.
					And unique grammar.
					So what are you doing? Becomes.
					Why do why do why do.
					It is one of the most recognizable accents and music and culture.
					And to show us an example.
					Music legend Bob Marley.
					in my life and for them to meet other people.
					Life important.
					My life is all important of me.
					I had plenty people in me. Give me.
					My life is just me, my own security.
					Let me know what my life is with people.
					Now let's go to South Africa.
					The South African accent has British roots.
					But also took influences from Dutch and indigenous languages such as Zulu and salsa.
					And to show us an example of South African English, one of my favorite musicians, Sean Morgan from
					the band Seether.
					country song is just called countries.
					I don't think it has anything country to do with it.
					It was just we used country song as a, as a, as a working title for that.
					In fact, I think it's more swampy than anything else and bluesy.
					Okay, my friends.
					And that is just a small taste of English accents from around the world.
					Which one do you think is the hardest to understand?
					Tell me in the comments below, guys, come!
					Which is the most gracious purveyor?
					Most famous plant?
