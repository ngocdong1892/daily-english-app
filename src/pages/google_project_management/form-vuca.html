					within
					organizations and settings with different cultures, business objectives, and industry
					dynamics.<br />In
					this video, we’ll discuss some different scenarios in which you’d want to adopt an Agile
					mindset.<br />I’ll also introduce you to a concept called VUCA that can help you decide which
					management
					approach is best for your project.<br />Remember, Agile is about delivering value in a world with
					high
					degrees of uncertainty, risk, and competition.<br />It sets a team up to react as quickly as
					possible to
					new information, new market opportunities, and even new technologies.<br />Agile works best in
					industries or projects that are susceptible to, or that encourage, change and uncertainty.<br />What
					kinds of businesses or industries, besides software, come to mind that deal with lots of
					change?<br />A
					few that I think of are biotechnology, with emerging vaccines, treatments, and technologies; media,
					with
					endless new ways to share content; the food industry, with celebrity chefs and the latest food
					craze;
					and fashion, an industry built on keeping up with shifting trends.<br />Did any of these surprise
					you?<br />On the flip side, here are some industries that you might think of as fairly stable–
					agriculture, aerospace, manufacturing, and mining.<br />But even these industries, with rigorous
					supply
					chains and codes, have to adapt to change due to new laws and regulations, natural disasters, and
					other
					unforeseen issues.<br />One thing that the year 2020 taught all of us is that no industry is truly
					immune to change and uncertainty.<br />We’re going to explore a concept for categorizing and
					thinking
					about these forces that shape our world, no matter what industry we’re in.<br />That concept is
					called
					VUCA, and it can help you decide which project management approach is best for you.<br />The US
					Military
					War College developed a concept called VUCA, spelled V-U-C-A. VUCA is an acronym that defines the
					conditions that affect organizations in a changing and complex world.<br />It was designed to help
					us
					factor in the forces of change and uncertainty in our projects and businesses.<br />VUCA stands for
					volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity.<br />I’ll explain each one and what that could
					entail in projects and business settings.<br />First up is volatility.<br />Volatility refers to the
					rate of change and churn in a business or situation.<br />In a volatile project, you would discuss
					how
					the next disruption to your operations is always right around the corner, or it feels like things
					never
					have time to settle into a normal rhythm.<br />Next is uncertainty.<br />Uncertainty refers to the
					lack
					of predictability or high potential for surprise.<br />In an uncertain environment, it would be
					difficult to create plans for the future that were not based on a large number of assumptions that
					could
					turn out to be incorrect.<br />Then there’s complexity.<br />Complexity refers to the high number of
					interrelated forces, issues, organizations, and factors that would influence the project.<br />For
					example, if one product being worked on relied on diverse and global suppliers, that would add to
					the
					complexity of the project.<br />And finally, we have ambiguity.<br />Ambiguity refers to the
					possibility
					of misunderstanding the conditions and root causes of events or circumstances.<br />A project that
					suffered from ambiguity would have difficulty pinpointing the causes of project delays, making it
					difficult to design mitigation plans to reduce the risks.<br />Let’s recap.<br />VUCA stands for
					volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity.<br />It’s a concept that was developed to deal
					with
					these forces in a changing and uncertain world.<br />Businesses can apply the concept of VUCA as a
					tool
					for determining how best to approach projects.<br />Phew, that’s a lot of info, but it’s all good
					stuff.<br />Having an understanding of these concepts will help with decision making in all kinds of
					projects.<br />Adopting an Agile approach increases your chances of success despite this
					uncertainty.<br />And these concepts apply to the business world at large, not just
					projects.<br />[MUSIC PLAYING] Now, let’s discuss why it’s important to understand VUCA as it
					relates to
					project management.<br />When we get started on a new project, it’s helpful to examine the
					environment
					and conditions in which the project exists before we decide the best approach to use.<br />If your
					project environment has high levels of volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity, then it’s
					a
					good sign that you should consider an Agile approach.<br />While an Agile approach is not a perfect
					solution that will get rid of VUCA, it will lead to better outcomes by giving you and your team
					tools
					and systems to mitigate the risks that VUCA presents.<br />When you consider Agile values and
					principles, it’s clear that Agile is a proven and well-documented solution to the challenges VUCA
					presents to your project.<br />OK, let’s revisit the Office Green scenario we introduced earlier in
					the
					program.<br />We’ll use this scenario throughout this course, as well, to illustrate the power of an
					Agile approach to project management.<br />If you’re just joining us now, I’ll give you a quick
					recap.<br />In previous courses, learners acted as the lead project manager at Office Green, LLC, a
					commercial landscaping company focused on interior plant design for offices, restaurants, and
					hotels.<br />For this Agile course, we’ll come back to Office Green as they pursue a new business
					opportunity.<br />The Office Green market research team noticed a major shift to more workers
					setting up
					and working from a home office.<br />They wanted to react fast to a potentially huge market
					opportunity
					and not lose revenue if businesses had less need for their previous office service.<br />Instead of
					offering indoor landscaping designs for businesses, Office Green wants to find a way to capture this
					new
					market full of home offices.<br />I don’t know about you all, but I have a hard time keeping plants
					alive.<br />I can’t keep a cactus alive.<br />But I love all those video conference backgrounds that
					are
					so nicely decorated with beautiful live plants.<br />This shift to working from home came about
					suddenly, so Office Green didn’t have any project plans to start from.<br />They didn’t have time to
					do
					a lot of prep work, but they wanted to maximize this opportunity before it was too late.<br />To do
					this, Office Green assigned you to be the project manager of a scrappy new Agile team.<br />Your
					goal is
					to deliver their new service, called Virtual Verde.<br />What environment did Office Green
					face?<br />Volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity.<br />They experienced volatility in
					the
					form of a major disruptive change to their business plans; uncertainty, through a lack of
					predictability, which made it difficult to create concrete plans for the future; a high level of
					complexity due to interrelated factors, like suppliers and the economy; and they experienced
					ambiguity
					by not being able to determine or control what might cause future changes.<br />By using an Agile
					approach to their project, Office Green was able to address high VUCA factors that were affecting
					their
					business.<br />Instead of business slowly or quickly eroding due to market forces, Office Green
					embraced
					the changing market and remained flexible in how they approach their next project.<br /></p>
