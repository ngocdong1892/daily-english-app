					good content to help with your English and they can't stop you because you want to learn you want to
					learn so you will learn so today I gonna talk about something that is very important to me Jiu Jitsu
					okay uh you may notice that I'm wearing something a little bit different okay this is called a ghee
					okay it's called a ghee and you wear a ghee and a lot of different martial arts Okay Brazilian Jiu
					Jitsu is a martial art that I practice okay I train Brazilian Jiu Jitsu I love jiu jitsu I think
					that Brazilian Jiu Jitsu is a great Hobby and a great exercise here are some reasons why I love
					Brazilian Jiu Jitsu first reason because it is a great exercise it's a very good exercise for your
					body okay for your body makes you strong makes you strong and you burn a lot of calories okay you
					burn a lot of calories because you'll be sweating after you train you'll be sweating and it's hard
					it's diffusive okay not easy Jiu Jitsu is not easy and for that reason it's very very good for your
					body okay second reason it's good for your mind very good for your mind okay when you are competing
					in Jiu Jitsu you have to think faster than your opponent okay you have to know what they are going
					to try and do to you and you have to try to trick them okay you have to try and set traps for them
					okay trombas so jiu jitsu is a lot like chess it's a lot like chess because you want to make your
					opponent think that you're doing something over here you're doing something over here but really
					it's over here okay so it's like chess all right and you want to be one step ahead of your opponent
					the third reason that I love jiu jitsu is because I have made a lot of really good friends training
					Jiu Jitsu I've made some very good friends and they are very interesting people the reason that a
					lot of interesting people do Jiu Jitsu is because you cannot cannot be a boring person and do Jiu
					Jitsu okay it's extreme it's not boring um if you like to just sit around and you don't like to do
					fun things why would you ever go to a Jujitsu okay so all the friends that I've made in Jiu Jitsu
					they all do cool stuff okay they all have a lot of awesome hobbies they're smart okay they're
					they're interesting people and I've had a lot of good times with them so those are some of the
					reasons why I really like jiu jitsu now I have had some crazy experiences with Jiu Jitsu as well
					some crazy experiences okay so I have competed in tournaments in Jiu Jitsu against other people I've
					competed in tournaments was really cool it's fun to go up against a stranger and try and beat them
					somebody who you don't know a stranger that's conocido and try to defeat them it's pretty cool I had
					a really cool experience in Jiu Jitsu that was very special for me when I got my blue belt I got my
					blue belt from Miguel Torres okay and Miguel Torres is a legend and MMA mixed martial arts so to get
					my blue belt from Miguel it was an honor for me I was very proud of myself and it was a very happy
					day okay I'm very happy and special day in my life so getting my Bluebell from Miguel was a very
					very awesome day it was a very awesome and special day for me now the craziest thing that ever
					happened to me in Jiu Jitsu was I got hurt I got hurt really bad I got her ow I got hurt really bad
					okay so what happened was I got slammed boom boom I got slammed on the ground suelo I got slammed on
					the ground boom okay and separated separated my shoulder okay so this part of my shoulder was all
					the way down here okay now warning warning okay Rosso if you do not want to see something a little
					bit nasty askeroso of my injury I'll tell you where to skip okay so this is what my shoulder looked
					like after I got slammed on the ground okay this because this part was down here so later I had to
					have a surgery I had to have a surgery to fix it to put this part back up hook it back on okay so
					this is right after my surgery yeah and this was the scar I still have the scar so I'll have that
					scar for the rest of my life and I I could not I could not train work out or do anything hard for
					eight months for eight months my shoulder was healing so I could not train jiu jitsu but but the
					very next day the next day I'll proximo Dia that the doctor told me the doctor told me that I could
					train again I went to the gym I went to the gym and I started to train again because I loved jujitsu
					so I think I think that if you ever get the chance to go to a Jiu Jitsu gym and try it out I think
					you should because it's an awesome experience you're going to learn cool things you're going to meet
					cool people versus okay I think that you should try it out okay because I have really enjoyed
					training Jiu Jitsu I've been training for almost three years now and it makes me happy so I hope
					that this video was useful for you guys okay I just wanted to share to share my experiences with
					Miss Amigos okay call me samigos to give you guys a little bit of good English practice listening
					practice okay so I hope this was useful for you guys I'm going to keep on going with my mission of
					bringing you guys real quality English content and you guys keep on going with your mission of
