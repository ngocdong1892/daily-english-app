					hello my friends hello welcome back to my channel pensano Eng I am Kyle and here on my channel my
					mission is to bring you real English real English that you can understand okay and today we have a
					part two video okay couple days ago I made part one a very important expressions in English that you
					need to know in order to have normal everyday fluent conversations with people like me who are
					native English speakers okay so this is going to be a super valuable video for you guys and I think
					entertaining as well because when you learn these things like idiomatic expressions it's really an
					adventure a deeper dive into the language okay so I really hope you guys enjoy it it seems like some
					of you guys really enjoyed the last video okay so some of these EXP Expressions last week or not
					last week last Monday it was only two days ago guys I make so many videos I don't know when I made
					what all right but we're going to keep it going so on Monday I gave you five Expressions today I
					have five more and these are essential once again some of you guys who are a little bit more
					advanced in your English Journey you might know all these maybe you know three out of the five maybe
					all of them are new to you but even if you have heard these before it is important to really
					understand them okay to be able to have these meaningful conversations because people use these all
					the time and if you are unfamiliar with what they mean you're going to be like what does that even
					mean what does that mean I have no idea so I don't want you to get lost in a conversation for that
					reason I'm making this video to help you guys out so the first one now this one I think is not as
					common maybe you guys have not heard this one before okay out of the blue out of the blue now when
					something happens out of the blue it means that it happened by complete surprise okay complete
					surprise whoo you did not expect that to happen it just happened out of the blue so let's see maybe
					you have not talked to a friend of yours for 5 years and then one day he calls you you're like whoa
					John called me out of the blue I was never expecting to hear from him again he called me out of the
					blue now when I was making this list I decided to look up where this expression comes from because
					to me it makes no sense and I'm an English speaker like out of the blue what but basically it means
					out of the blue sky on C aul okay so that means it's not storming it's not raining but there's a
					lightning lightning and thunder okay so it's like that storm came out of nowhere out of the blue out
					of the Clear Blue Sky okay so out of the blue is something when something happens out of the blue
					it's a complete surprise okay you were not ready for it you were not expecting it it happened out of
					the blue next one I think that those of you guys who are a little bit further in your English
					Journey will have heard this okay but if you are just getting to the point where you can understand
					a nice intermediate English like this perhaps you have not heard this one yet all right piece of
					cake piece of cake means that something was super easy okay it was no problem at all to do it was
					super easy you did not have to try hard so the way we use this is if someone's like ah let's see
					maybe you're at the gym with your your friend okay your workout partner and he lifts 100 kilos 100
					kilos he's like yeah I just lifted 100 kilos that might be a little bit heavy for you you think you
					could do it and then you could say yeah that's a piece of cake that's easy I could do 100 kilos okay
					piece of cake Easy so uh a way that you guys say something similar in Spanish is Pano okay instead
					of saying eating bread in English we say oh piece of cake it was a piece of cake maybe you're
					explaining to somebody the process of doing something online okay you had to fill out some some
					forms or something and your friend is like hey I know that you did this before is it easy or is it
					difficult you say oh super easy I went to the website filled out all the papers piece of cake super
					easy okay so if you say that something was a piece of cake it was something that was super easy
					piece cake what do you guys think is learning English a piece of cake tell me down below number
					eight this one is fairly common as well I've said this I've used this one uh it's not something that
					you say every day but when somebody says it you need to know what it means right so this expression
					is I am all ears okay in Spanish it would be like so toos okay and I am all ears means I am
					listening intently okay I'm listening to everything you say you have my full focused attention I'm
					all yours buddy so if your friend is having some Pro some trouble some problems with his girlfriend
					he he calls you he's like hey man you know I'm I'm having some trouble I just really need somebody
					to talk to do you have a minute can we talk for you to tell your friend that you you're here for him
					and you you're you're ready to listen to him you're going to be there for him you say yeah man
					what's going on tell me I'm all ears I'm all ears I'm listening I'm all big old ears okay I'm all
					ears listen so that's a good one you guys that's a really good one to know I'm all ears next this
					one is common and like with piece of cake I'm sure that those of you guys who are a little bit
					further in your your English Journey a little bit more towards Advanced High intermediate Advanced
					you've probably heard this one before okay you've probably heard this one but for those of you guys
					who are more just getting to that intermediate level this is a good one for you to learn and know so
					break a leg break a leg okay break a leg break a leg when do we use this what do we say it for so
					break a leg means good luck okay good luck so you you tell somebody to break a leg when you're
					wishing them luck with something that they are about to do okay now this is very common in theater
					okay with actors or something like that or performers so for example if your friend plays guitar in
					a band and his band is about to do a concert they're going to play and you're talking with your
					friend and he's about to go play the music you say hey good luck man break a leg okay it just means
					good luck now where this one comes from I don't know I looked it up to try and find out so I could
					give you guys a satisfying explanation of where this comes from all I'm seeing is that it's either
					an old Superstition or it comes from a German frage frage frage German phrase uh which says leg and
					break okay so I have nothing better to tell you guys than that but we use it as the way to say good
					luck to somebody especially when they are about to go and perform okay to be in a play all right so
					break a leg guys break a leg is a good one to know and the last one this one is pretty common okay
					as a matter of fact I said this last night to a buddy of mine at work so hit the road hit the road
					this means to leave or to get going is another way to say it um there's a few different ways that we
					use this okay maybe you're hanging out with your family but you have to go to work you have to go to
					a doctor's appointment whatever it is you have to leave you say okay guys oh I love spending this
					time with you thank you Mom for cooking this dinner was delicious but I need to go I'm going to hit
					the road I'm going to hit the road okay I'm going to hit the road uh or maybe you're running late
					you're running late oh no no no no no no it's it's tday yeah it's thday and you and your family have
					to go catch a flight an airplane at the airport you might tell your wife baby come on come on we
					have to hit the road we're going to be late we have to hit the road hit the road is to leave to go
					to get going okay last night I said that to a buddy of mine at work uh he was talking cuz we joke
					around with each other at work sometimes we're a little bit mean to each other but we're just
					playing to pass the time and uh the boss came in and told him that he had to go and do something
					that he did not want to do so I laughed at him said Hit the Road Jack I told him to hit the road so
					I was making fun of him telling him go do that I know you don't want to but you better get going hit
					the road all right guys that's all for today five more very important Expressions that will 100%
					come up on your English journey and you will be much better off if you know them all right guys so
