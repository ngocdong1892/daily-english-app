					Hello everybody today we have something new something a bit different and something exciting today I
					am joined by Simone and Simone is from Scotland so guys you're are going to get to hear an accent an
					English accent that is very different from my own and I think it's going to be a very useful video a
					useful conversation for you guys so Simone could you please start by just telling us a bit about
					yourself sure um so I'm from Scotland I'm from like a really small village um on the border of
					England and it's very rural um so actually if you met other Scottish people they would tell you that
					my accent is super mild um and I'm about an hour away from Edinburgh which which is the capital of
					Scotland but I've actually not lived in Scotland for longer than one year for a long time now I was
					really fascinated with Thailand so I've lived in Bangkok for seven months I've lived in Vietnam
					which is where I currently am so I've lived here two times I the first first time I lived here for a
					year and three months then I left I've lived in Paris in France I've lived in Leon in France I I
					don't know if you can count this as living in India but I was in India for two months not just
					traveling it was like a little bit more like I was staying in one place and traveling at the
					weekends kind of thing um and now I'm back in Vietnam again and I've been here for almost two and a
					half years again all right you gave me a lot there I have a lot of questions but my first question
					is we okay super cool I just wanted to throw you a little curveball there yeah I'm sweating so okay
					I could tell you haven't practiced but it's obvious that you have an understanding of the French
					language so one of my other questions do you speak any other languages not really and um Vietnamese
					is really tough because it's a tonal language so like Chinese and Tai that they like a lot of words
					sound the exact same and could be the exact same but the only thing that differentiates them is the
					tones and as an English native speaker that is really difficult so I try my best with like daily bit
					and Bobs of Vietnamese but I could try harder and I know that and I am like probably a little bit of
					a lazy English speaker so I have a lot of Scottish ancestors but I don't know anything about
					Scotland whatsoever there's there's a weird thing here in the US where you know your grandparents
					you maybe if you're lucky you know your great grandparents and after that you know nothing about
					your ancestry so I just want to know a little bit about Scotland what what do you think of when you
					think of Scotland now that you've seen other parts of the world what is very Scottish I think that
					Scottish people like have a very distinct sense of humor and that's probably one of the things that
					I really like miss the most and just like I do think overall we're quite friendly and I have heard
					from other Travelers that have been to Scotland that they thought Scottish people were friendly I
					feel like and obviously it's like the the the the Celtic backgrounds that like Scottish people and
					Irish people we there are a lot of similarities like in Scotland call it banter in Ireland they call
					it the crack and it's just like you know like we we you know when the atmosphere is good and you're
					cracking jokes and I I just feel like that that feeling is very very Scottish have you been to
					Scotland I would love to I have not but now that I hear about the the sense of humor I might have to
					put it on the bucket list and I I have to say it is a beautiful beautiful beautiful country but the
					only problem is 95% of the time the weather is not great it is an absolutely stunning country like
					the mountains and stuff like but yeah there have been times where I've went to go see something and
					it's like pouring with rain and really cold and I'm like this would be really beautiful if the
					weather was there so when it's not raining is it just green and lovely yeah very uh luscious and
					beautiful and yeah so your favorite thing about the country uh I would assume is the People based on
					how how friendly they sound and the the fun that you guys have what is your least favorite what is
					something you don't miss about your home oh I know what I to say and I wonder if it's going to be a
					bit controversial um I don't miss and actually I would say this is the UK in general I don't miss
					How deep the drinking culture is um yeah um and I'm like I'm going to turn 33 next month so I did
					all that I did all the crazy partying I did you know at Uni the getting wasted every weekend um so
					I'm not saying that I'm like above any of that but I'm at this stage now where I I don't drink a lot
					at all anymore  um and I see like how huge it like it's such a like pillar of like what what
					what to do in the UK like yeah there are other things to do than just that all the time you know I I
					agree 100% I'm 33 myself and I was a drunk in my early 20s but I'm a father now I'm married and I do
					not have time to be hung over for three days no oh my God and that happens in your 30s yes it does
					for example in Vietnam where I am now it is really hot it is really nice a lot of people will just
					hang out outside and like drink coffee the cafe culture is huge here okay and what is your favorite
					thing about Vietnam what can you tell us about that part of the world it's kind of hard to pick one
					favorite can I pick three top three would be great okay food the food is amazing I'm vegetarian and
					it is like heaven here for vegetarians and there's a lot of tofu going on um the people are super
					friendly and so Keen to learn English they are so Keen to learn English like if you just go into a
					park and you you're by yourself you will definitely get approached by people that just want to come
					up and practice their English with you and the other thing is the like the beauty of Nature and it's
					kind of sad because I live in the big crazy City hoi Min um so like dayt day I don't really get to
					see it but there are like Parts in the north that are absolutely stunning and I think that like
					Vietnam is still a little bit of a Hidden Gem that not that many people know like how stunning the
					landscape is here um but I do think it's starting to get a bit more well known and starting to get a
					little bit more touristy compared to maybe like the first time I lived here so guys Simone and I are
					going to make a video about spirituality uh her experiences with that because she has a super cool
					YouTube channel which will be in the description you guys can practice your English practice hearing
					that Scottish accent and learn about spirituality she's got tons of cool stuff on there but if you
					want to see my deep dive into spirituality with her join the membership down below because that's
					where this video will be so I would like to wrap this video up with ah quickfire Scottish slang I
					would I want to say a couple words that and yes just first thing that comes to your mind a quick
					explanation of what they mean if okay sure I love it okay bra can you spell that b r a w oh br oh BR
					is beautiful means something beautiful that's bra that's good that's beautiful yeah okay that sounds

					to me okay yeah Canen all right but now I know now I know next numpty numpty that's so brilliant
					that you've got that word a numpty is somebody that's really stupid like if somebody did something
					stupid you'd be like oh you numpty okay okay see I I looked up on uh chat GPT I said give me a list
					of Scottish slang without explanation so I have no idea what these mean okay next one I'm I'm

					really like sick and pale and Ill okay well we'll assume it means under the weather not looking too

					native language thank you so much thank you thanks for having me and I hope that my Scottish accent
