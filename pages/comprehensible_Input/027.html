					Hello everybody. Welcome back to Pensano English. Today we are doing another English conversation
					with a subscriber of mine. And this is a special conversation because this is a subscriber who I

					year and probably two months more. Okay. So, this is going to be super fun. and we're going to be
					able to see all of the progress that you have made. And these videos are super special for me
					because I get really proud of you guys. I get to see that you've been working really hard on your
					English. So, first of all, for people who didn't see the first one, can you please introduce
					yourself? Uh, yeah.
					Hello guys, my name is Lace, Loyal subscriber for here, my friend Kyle.
					Kale and me uh had a conversation one year and three months ago and yeah uh that's all for me. I'm
					I'm from Colombia. I'm so eager to hear with you.
					Okay. Awesome. And how old are you now, Louis? Uh 27. 27. All right. And how long have you been
					learning English?
					Well, uh, two years with serious focus because in certainly situations I I had the the goal to learn
					English, but you know, just sporadic classes here and there, and I don't take English seriously, but
					two years, I take seriously the the learning of this h beautiful language. All right. And I could
					already tell you've improved so much since our last call. I'm very happy for you. Can you give us
					summary of what you've been doing now that you've been taking it more seriously? What is your your
					learning routine like? Well, my routine uh using English is like uh I have a really thorough
					immersion in vocabulary. I just take I use a tool named Anki Anki sorry and use that application to
					review my vocabulary every day. This is so important. And this I use that vocabulary in multiple
					ways like create a short story or a conversation between native speakers using that vocabulary and
					apply them and then create a quiz to compre to comprehension reading uh comprehension listening. I
					use a multiple platforms. I use strategy which is really cool tool for if you want to learn any
					language whatever and yeah that sounds my routine approximately about three hours per day I'm so
					focusing in get English all right now some questions just to practice like last time where I asked
					you questions about life about all kinds of things okay just so we can see how your vocabulary is
					and where your English is overall so besides is improving your English. What are your other goals
					right now? What are some other things you're working on? Yeah, I'm working on my French as well. Um
					I I can't speak French so in the same fluency manner. My French is so terrible, but when you when
					you learn how to grasp a new a new language is more easy, grasp a new one, you know. So yeah and
					another goal is uh get um my I don't know how to say that when you starting at university uh degrade
					or degree yeah your degree my degree in engineering software engineering so what's the deal with
					your French why are you why are you trying to learn French well I I really like French I consider
					myself a really keen love lover person. I don't know how to say but it's romantic or romantic. I'm
					so romantic. Ah, yeah. Yeah. I use French because I sorry I use French because I can't I really want
					to have a conversation with my future wife with French and Oh, you speak French. I fell in love with
					you.
					Yeah, I love it. Okay. I think that as men a lot of our motivations are for the women in our life
					and for right but yeah behind that reason I have a multiple others because French is a really
					beautiful language sorry French is a beautiful language that I really want to get into that because
					French sounds really cool and that's that culture is really interesting as well for me you know
					romantic relationship ship isn't is not the unique motivation that I have. But yeah, that's a
					powerful one. I I know exactly what you mean. It it feels so cool to speak French. It's just an
					awesome language. It sounds so cool. Yeah. Yeah. You you you feel you feel yourself as a I don't
					know like more elevated person. I don't know how to express that but yeah. Okay. So, where would you
					like to travel if you could go anywhere? Would you like to go somewhere where you could speak
					English?
					France, where would you like to travel?
					I really I I really want to go for example to Europe because I really want to go throughout the the
					ocean. I I think that is Pacific Ocean. Just uh throughout all the ocean and visit European land.
					For me, that was that was my one of my goals related to travel. I visit Europe. I I I don't have a
					country that I really prefer. I just travel and new and know new places. But that that's all. But
					definitely I don't go for example just for for the language. I I really get out out of my comfort
					zone. What do you think is your biggest strength as a person and what is your biggest weakness? Is
					the same quality is a little curious because I'm so disciplined person. So disciplined person. I
					consider myself as a disciplined person but at the same time it's a little is my most weakness but
					because in some situations my discipline uh force me to to say no for the things that I really want
					and in certain situations I my body my mind wants to take a rest but I say no just continue working
					and that's bad because you encounter you will encounter for the point that you need to take a rest
					force forcely and if you don't stop you waste probably one week recovering for the all the effort
					that you put in in your past days that's my weaknesses at the same time I for that reason because I
					don't have the time to you know just do nothing for just one day but no I I need to get something
					learn English or just read or just even uh painting h play guitar something but I need to do
					something and that's isn't isn't good if you don't have a correct balance you know definitely yeah I
					think I'm the same way I always want to be working on my goals getting closer to my goals but
					sometimes you have to stop and I like to meditate for that reason or you know just go for a walk
					outside and you know to the birds and stuff. You have to chill out sometimes. Definitely. Yeah.
					Yeah. Okay.
					Now, this is one of my favorite questions. I asked you before, but I want to see how you respond now
					versus how you last time. So, what is your biggest fear? Yeah. Well, like the last time, my biggest
					fear doesn't change.
					probably doesn't change even if I have if I have faced the years. My biggest fear is when I get
					older and say that I don't take advantage of the opportunity that got me to live and take advantage
					of that time to help other people, inspire others and you know have the fear what if if I had taken
					certainly opportunities inside of my life how could my life change now that kind of things is my
					biggest fear because I don't I don't have I I I I really hate if if in my future I have that feeling
					about okay um I could be more different the things different I could uh do the things more yeah uh
					take advantage or take a lever of the my time and don't waste it I have that fear the feeling I
					don't help anything anyone one or I could be more things. I don't know.
					Yeah. Yeah. I don't want to go to my grave living isolated or without accomplishing my goals. That's
					my biggest fear.
					Definitely so far. Okay. Wow. Yeah. To to not reach your full potential, right?
					If you could trade lives with somebody for one day, who would it be?
					Definitely. I really want change with a dog who live close to the beach. Please one day because Have
					you ever seen a dog running into sunset in the beach with happiness just barking and be happy? You
					know that's I I really want for that opportunity. That is the most perfect answer you could have
					given to that question. That Wow. Wow.
					Love it. I wish I could do that as well.
					And when when I went when we went to Colombia, my son, there was a lot of dogs just running around,
					you know. And my son said, "Oh, no. They don't have a home. They're probably sad." And I said, "No,
					look at that dog. He's so happy. No responsibilities. He lays down and sleeps wherever he wants.
					Beautiful weather." Wow. Yeah. Yeah. the the town is your home and you just leave the present, you
					know. Wow. Just leave the present. We need to be more like dogs on the beach. That's that's
					beautiful philosophy right there. Wow. Okay. I like that so much. I'm going to tell my wife about
					that. She's going to like it.
					If you could have any superpower, what would it be and why? Oh, wow. That's cool. You don't know.
					You don't probably don't believe me, but that question are was in my mind for recently days. Well, I
					probably select a fly. probably isn't a really cool superpower at first glance, but one of my dreams
					is fly, you know, but it's impossible because human beings don't have a wings or, you know, but
					yeah, I really want to even when I go to my to the boss who pass for this area, that boss passed for
					through a really land really beautiful landscapes And I I I don't know. I really have the, you know,
					that uh thumbs in my hair that I really just go for that window and start to fly through this
					landscape. And yeah, that's my that's my one of my dreams. And for that reason, I picked that
					superpower. Bye. There's people watching who are thinking this guy speaks English so good. I want to
					be able to have a conversation like that.
					You haven't asked me one time, oh uh what did you say I didn't understand?
					You understood everything I said and you're you're speaking so fluently. What would you tell people
					who are watching who want to be able to speak like you?
					What's your advice? Well, I just have well I have a multiple advices but the most important for me
					the first step that you need to take is be consistent.
					No matter at first you system is quite rare or accurate even no matter that it's just uh be
					consistent uh you'll start to see a real progress because if you have a good motivations for just
					one day like four hours but if you lose it the rest of the days probably you don't progress uh like
					you want. So be consistent. No matter if you're using Dualingo at first, be consistent. That's my
					most important advice. Yeah. Yeah.
					Okay. I agree with that very much, guys.
					A little bit every day, at the end of a year, this is what happens. You'll be speaking like this
					guy. And if you do a lot every day consistently, you will improve so much faster. And your hard work
					shows. So, thank you for your time, Louise. Thank you for your support on the channel, for spending
					your time with me today. I appreciate this conversation with you. It was so nice for me and it was
					just I'm proud of you. You've done so well with your English. So, excellent. Thank you, Kyle.
					Greetings for your subscribers or I hope you have a good one. Um, thank you as well. Okay, guys. If
					you would like to have a conversation like this with me, my email is in the description below. send
					me an email and we will have a conversation like I just had with my buddy Louise.
					All right, my friendsto.
