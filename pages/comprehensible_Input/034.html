					In this video I am going to tell you the story of exactly why and how I learn fluent Spanish or in
					Spanish let's [Music] go okay guys so where I live in Indiana in the United States there are a lot
					of a lot of Mexican people for whatever reason Mexican people looked at a map of the United States
					and thought hm we want to go way up there I'm just joking about that part guys I imagine it's
					because where I live in Indiana is very close to the big city of Chicago where there are jobs where
					there are opportunities and where there is a government that is more friendly to immigrants so
					anyway regardless of the reason they are here when I was going to school I was with a lot of Mexican
					kids and they were speaking Spanish and I always thought that it would be so cool so cool to be able
					to understand them and to be honest a couple of times I tried to learn but much like learning how to
					play the guitar it sounded like something I really wanted to be able to do but when I tried I found
					out that it is not easy so I quit so after high school I forgot all about my dreams of learning
					Spanish Let's fast forward to when I was 28 years old and I was using a dating app Don't Judge Me
					guys you've probably done it too right right right and I met a girl I met a girl and she was Mexican
					but she came to the United States when she was 3 years old so she spoke English just like I do okay
					super good perfect English if you were listening to her you would not know that she was Mexican she
					only spoke Spanish with her family and that was my problem the family now her dad from years of
					working here in the US he spoke really good English and we got along really good in fact one time I
					went deer hunting with him and five of his buddies five of his friends that did not speak English
					but that's a story for another video the girl's mother however spoke zero English how scary for me
					right I have to meet the mom and the mom speaks no English so once again I wanted to learn Spanish
					and this time I had a real motivation not only did I have a real motivation but I had no excuses why
					because the pandemic started the pandemic started and I had nothing else to do so I had no excuses
					now during the pandemic I went to a huge party that these Mexicans were having apparently they had
					not heard the current CDC recommendations anyway there was a huge party probably 100 people there
					and I was the only one that did not speak Spanish that was the last straw guys I was going to learn
					Spanish COC I was going to learn Spanish so how did I do it well I started out by doing the things
					that most people do when they want to learn a language right I downloaded du lingo and a couple of
					other apps like Babel and no disrespect to these apps but 15 minutes a day like these apps recommend
					is not enough to learn how to speak with native speakers in a different language so I decided that I
					needed to do more and I did the next thing that most people do when they want to learn a language I
					bought a course and to be fair this was a really great course it taught me how to say key and useful
					phrases for example vo I am going to do this helped me a lot to know how to say very useful things
					and ask very useful questions the problem I could not understand the people when they replied to me
					so once again I kept on looking kept on looking and I found one of my favorite websites I talkie it
					talkie is an awesome website where you can pay for one-onone lessons with a native speaker of really
					whatever language you want to learn I took tons of classes and met tons of interesting people on
					italki some of whom I consider to be friends to this very day and in the beginning the classes were
					very structured and we would learn grammar and useful vocabulary and how to say very useful things
					but one day I found something that allowed me to progress so fast my Spanish exploded and I was able
					to start using italki to have real conversations but what was the thing that I found that helped my
					Spanish just blow up to explode well it was my favorite YouTube channel of all time dreaming Spanish
					when I found dreaming Spanish I was introduced to the idea of comprehensible input or listening and
					watching things made easy for you to understand but they are all 100% in the language that you are
					trying to learn and guys just a side note I really owe so much of the way that my life is now so
					many of the great things that I have in my life I owe to Dreaming Spanish and I really hope that one
					day I could tell the creator of dreaming Spanish Pablo what he's done for me so I really hope one
					day I can have a conversation with Pablo that's really like one of my my Spanish dreams and goals
					one day I'm going to make it happen so guys when I found dreaming Spanish I I was hooked I was
					addicted I could not stop watching the videos they were incredible the way that Pablo and the other
					people that he has on his team for dreaming Spanish the way that they made Spanish comprehensible
					understandable to me was just amazing it blew my mind and I could not get enough I watched hours and
					hours and hours of dreaming Spanish every day at least 1 hour but some days 3 and 4 hours now
					luckily for me I have a job where I have to work really hard for a little bit and then I get long
					breaks so I was able to consume so much so much of dreaming Spanish and the more I watched the more
					I could understand the more I could speak in my conversations on iie it was incredible and within a
					year I was having deep enriching beautiful conversations with Spanish speakers all around the world
					I was watching shows from all around the world on Netflix fully in Spanish I was reading novels from
					my favorite authors in Spanish so that my friends is the story of why and how I learned Spanish but
					my story doesn't end there things didn't work out with the Mexican girl I have no hard feelings I
					wish her and her family the best but I am very grateful for the experiences I had with them that
					started me on my Spanish Journey because it led me to the incredible place in my life where I am now
					number one this channel this YouTube channel of mine where I try to share what Pablo shared with me
					okay the work that Pablo did on dreaming Spanish impacted me so much that I wanted to share it with
					Spanish speakers all around the world I wanted to make learning English fun effortless and awesome
					like Pablo made Spanish learning for me so that's what I've tried to do here on my YouTube channel
					which has become a huge part of my life where I've met inred incredible people and made friendships
					and also guys I met an incredible woman and if it wasn't for the work that Pablo did on dreaming
					Spanish and the hours that I spent consuming his content I would have never met my wife because when
					I met my wife who is a beautiful Colombian woman she did not speak English she knew maybe like I did
					at the beginning of my Spanish Journey a little bit of vocabulary where's the bathroom this little
					things right but she was not able to have conversations in English so when I met her luckily I had
					been through this journey this Spanish Learning Journey and learned how to speak Spanish we met and
					the first 6 months of our relationship were all in Spanish guys I fell in love in Spanish and fell
					in love even more with Spanish so that is the reason why I feel like I need to personally thank
					poblo because without dreaming Spanish I would not be married to the woman I'm married to today I
					would not have this YouTube channel that has enrich my life so much so guys I have I can and I will
					make more videos about my personal Journey where Spanish has taken me but all of that is my journey
					okay and your journey is going to be very different but what I want you to take away from hearing
					about my journey is that if you can find a real reason a strong reason why you really want to learn
					a language you can you can and it can take you on adventures you never dreamed of take it from me my
					friends it can be done and it can change your life thank you for watching I wish you luck and like I
					always say in my videos see you soon my friends [Music]
