				<p id="1cf468a0-53d4-8133-a706-dcbdd7c195c2" class="">SPEAKER: Just as Agile has core values that teams
					must
					adhere, to Scrum has its own set of pillars that act as a foundation for Scrum teams.<br />I’ll go
					through the three pillars of Scrum in this video.<br />Let’s start by looking at the theory behind
					Scrum, so that we could learn the various methods and understand why they’re effective.<br />First,
					what
					is Scrum?<br />The Scrum guide defines Scrum as a framework for developing, delivering, and
					sustaining
					complex products.<br />That means a team can use Scrum to create valuable products for their users,
					even
					when the environment or industry they’re in is hard to predict, and there are many risks.<br />Scrum
					uses an iterative and incremental approach.<br />Iterative refers to the fact that project processes
					are
					repeated.<br />We discussed this a bit in the last module.<br />But as a reminder, iterative means
					that
					the project works in time boxes or iterations.<br />Incremental refers to the work being divided
					into
					smaller chunks that build on each other.<br />The product is built over time through work done
					during
					each iteration.<br />Each of these instances of the product is called an increment.<br />Iterations
					and
					increments allow us to keep checking in on our progress throughout the lifecycle of the
					project.<br />This helps us become more predictable and manage the uncertainty in our
					project.<br />Scrum is founded on a scientific theory called empiricism.<br />This is a fancy word
					for a
					simple concept, that true knowledge comes from actual lived experience.<br />The Scrum founders
					emphasized that we shouldn’t try to assume that things will go exactly as planned or try to predict
					the
					future in an uncertain world.<br />Instead, if you’re using Scrum, you’re ensuring that each
					decision
					you make in your project is based on real experience and hard data.<br />So each iteration and
					increment
					is understood as a mini experiment, where we can learn really valuable things to help improve the
					project.<br />Empiricism is built on three foundational pillars.<br />Those pillars are
					transparency,
					inspection, and adaptation.<br />And they’re also the three pillars of Scrum.<br />First, there’s
					transparency.<br />Transparency means that we make the most significant aspects of our work visible
					to
					those responsible for the outcome.<br />Everyone must be transparent.<br />This includes everyone
					from
					Scrum team members to senior sponsors, and even our users.<br />It’s easier to be transparent with a
					small team.<br />And luckily, Scrum teams are deliberately small, ranging between three and nine
					people.<br />This way, you avoid mixed signals, breakdowns of communication, and unnecessary
					complications.<br />Transparency inside a Scrum team is critical to the team’s productivity and the
					project’s completion.<br />In terms of transparency outside of the team, being transparent with all
					stakeholders, including customers, sponsors, and management builds a level of trust between everyone
					involved.<br />Transparency also encourages more collaboration and fewer mistakes.<br />The second
					pillar of Scrum is inspection.<br />Inspection refers to conducting timely checks towards the
					outcome of
					a Sprint goal to detect undesirable variances.<br />This means that we’re always checking in on our
					progress and deliverables so that we can detect any undesirable changes.<br />When teams work in an
					agile way, a stakeholder review of their work is a necessary opportunity for growth and
					progress.<br />The more inspections that take place, the more improvement a team experiences in
					their
					work.<br />There’s real value to be gained from deliberate inspection while you have a chance to
					change
					and improve.<br />Inspection also propels our next pillar, adaptation.<br />Adaptation means that
					we’re
					continuously searching for ways to adjust our project, product, or processes to minimize any further
					deviation or issues.<br />In Scrum and in Agile, as a whole, for that matter, we embrace change so
					that
					we are always improving.<br />So when we adapt, we change aspects that do not work or could be
					better.<br />Transparency and inspection gives Scrum teams the information and opportunity they need
					to
					identify improvements or changes.<br />Although adaptation includes immediate fixes to problems, it
					may
					also be about implementing a change so future projects don’t repeat past mistakes.<br />Now you know
					the
					three pillars that act as a foundation to Scrum– transparency, inspection, and
					adaptation.<br />[MUSIC
					PLAYING] Scrum teams work and behave according to five core values– commitment, courage, focus,
					openness, and respect.<br />First, there’s commitment.<br />This means personally committing to
					achieving the goals of the Scrum team.<br />For example, maybe a member of the team is struggling to
					overcome something that is blocking their work from getting done, like a new technology that is
					proving
					difficult to learn.<br />In this case, another team member who is familiar with the technology can
					put
					their own work aside to step in and help their teammate learn the technology.<br />The second value
					is
					courage.<br />Scrum team members must have the courage to do the right thing and work on tough
					problems.<br />In any project, there’s a body of work that needs to get done.<br />Some of the work
					will
					be relatively simple, and some will be complex with many risks.<br />An example of courage includes
					taking on a hard task that you know will require you to learn a new skill.<br />Courage could mean
					telling your team that you’re stuck and you need help.<br />It might also mean calling out a
					negative
					behavior within the team to openly discuss and address the behavior.<br />Demonstrating courage when
					responding to challenging situations can strengthen the team’s resilience.<br />Third, there’s
					focus.<br />This refers to everyone focusing on the necessary work within the Sprint, and the
					overall
					goals of the Scrum team.<br />For example, a team member is working on a solution that involves a
					new
					technology, and is very difficult. Allowing that team member to focus on that difficult yet
					necessary
					part of the solution is key.<br />And their teammates help get it across the finish line.<br />They
					know
					that focusing on the solution will speed up the team’s progress in the long run.<br />So it’s worth
					the
					investment now.<br />The Scrum master, a role often assumed by the project manager, helps the team
					to
					focus on the Sprint and product goals by facilitating their activities and events on a daily
					basis.<br />The fourth value is openness.<br />For Scrum to work, the team and its stakeholders
					agree to
					be open about all the work and the various challenges that come with performing the
					work.<br />Openness
					is essential to a productive Scrum team.<br />In order to gather data, team members must be willing
					to
					share their observations and experiences.<br />If a team member runs into an issue within the
					project
					that they aren’t sure how to fix, they should share it with the team.<br />Another team member may
					have
					a very quick and easy solution or, at least, valuable insight into some options on how to handle
					their
					issue.<br />The fifth and final Scrum pillar is respect.<br />Team members should respect the
					opinions,
					skills, and independence of their teammates.<br />When you respect the independence and
					contributions of
					others, and feel respected yourself, you’re more likely to listen and hear any feedback.<br />This
					is
					crucial in making the product or business as successful as possible.<br />In order for a team to
					bring
					the three pillars of Scrum to life, they must act in accordance with the five Scrum values.<br />For
					example, if a team aims to achieve transparency between themselves and their stakeholders, they need
					to
					be open to sharing information, while still having the focus to share the most relevant
					information.<br />For a team to effectively inspect their work and their processes, they must have
					courage to offer difficult feedback and have the mutual respect to really listen to what others have
					to
					say.<br />For a team to adapt to their inspection results, they must have the courage to make
					changes
					and learn from them.<br />They must also be committed to the goals of the team, and follow through
					on
					the adaptation.<br />Amazing.<br />We’ve now covered the foundational pillars and values behind a
					Scrum
					team.<br />We’ve also covered how the team supports Scrum values as they relate to
					Agile.<br />[MUSIC
					PLAYING] Let’s start by discussing the team’s product vision and mission.<br />Remember, Scrum is an
					Agile methodology, so it embodies the values and principles of Agile.<br />One of the Agile
					principles
					states, “Build projects around motivated individuals.<br />Give them the environment and support
					they
					need and trust them to get the job done.” The best way to motivate individuals is to give them a
					mission
					and product vision that they really care about so they can feel good about working towards
					it.<br />In
					Agile, a mission is a short statement that stays constant for your team throughout the process and
					gives
					them something to work toward.<br />In addition to the mission, an Agile team will also set a
					product
					vision, making it clear what outcomes the team is responsible for, and where your team’s boundaries
					are.<br />This may sound a bit like management-speak.<br />But I like to think about it this
					way.<br />A
					mission tells me why we’re doing the work.<br />A product vision helps me imagine what the work will
					be
					like when we’re done.<br />Let’s think about the mission and product vision with Office Green’s new
					Virtual Verde project.<br />Virtual Verde delivers plants to people’s home offices.<br />Office
					Green’s
					business development department came up with a mission for the project.<br />Virtual Verde improves
					users health and happiness by bringing their at-home workspace to life.<br />A product vision,
					created
					by the Scrum team might be, Virtual Verde is a living marketplace that transforms the home
					office.<br />These two statements are meant to inspire the team to deliver a delightful experience
					for
					Virtual Verde’s users.<br />Now let’s discuss Scrum team roles.<br />Every Scrum team consists of
					three
					defined roles– a Scrum Master, a product owner, and the development team.<br />These roles work
					together
					to achieve the team’s objectives and realize the mission and vision.<br />The product owner is
					responsible for what a team builds.<br />They also must ensure everyone understands the
					why.<br />For
					example, the Virtual Verde team needs a product owner to capture and promote the great ideas coming
					from
					the team about the new service, which is delivering plants to people who work from home.<br />The
					product owner’s job is to build the right thing.<br />The development team is responsible for how a
					team
					will deliver that product.<br />For example, creating a new website is next on to-do list.<br />So
					customers can order plants for their home office.<br />The development team is building websites,
					integrating billing systems, and fixing issues.<br />The development team’s job is to build the
					thing
					right.<br />The Scrum Master is responsible for when a team will deliver value to its
					users.<br />This
					role is roughly equivalent to the project manager role in traditional projects.<br />The Virtual
					Verde’s
					Scrum Master helping unblock the team from getting things done, such as finding out why a vendor was
					late or helping the team prioritize issues from users or organizing the demo for the CEO.<br />The
					Scrum
					Master’s job is to build the thing fast.<br />Although there are clearly defined roles on a Scrum
					team,
					it’s important to note that the entire team works together to achieve its goals.<br />In other
					words,
					although there are specific expectations for each role, the development team may still contribute
					ideas
					for the what and the when of a project, while the product owner may contribute to discussions on the
					how
					of the project.<br />As a collective, Scrum teams must exhibit a few specific skills.<br />The Scrum
					guide details these skills as follows.<br />Scrum teams are cross-functional.<br />When a Scrum team
					delivers something, it’s the accomplishment of the entire team, no matter what function or
					organization
					they’re in.<br />On your Scrum team, you may have a software developer, a marketing specialist,
					quality
					assurance, and logistics expert.<br />You may remember our soccer team analogy.<br />When each
					player
					comes together to play their position, the end result is you have all you need to get the ball into
					the
					goal.<br />Plus, these fresh perspectives add a lot of value to your project and to your users and
					business.<br />Scrum teams are self-organizing.<br />This may sound radically different from other
					organizations you’ve worked at before where your managers dictate your tasks and request frequent
					updates.<br />But because Scrum teams rely on those five values– commitment, courage, focus,
					openness,
					and respect– the scrum team is able to work together to deliver amazing results in a more organic
					and
					flexible environment.<br />Although teams are self-organizing, high-performing Scrum teams often
					have a
					manager who sits outside of the Scrum team, and provides strategic leadership and individual career
					development without disrupting the self-organizing nature of Scrum.<br />In my experience, if a
					manager
					feels compelled to start telling the team what to do and interferes with the self-organizing nature,
					the
					benefits of Scrum will begin to collapse.<br />Now that you have a better understanding of what
					constitutes a Scrum team, we’ll take you through the specifics of each role in the next few
					videos.<br />We’ll start with the traits of an effective Scrum Master.<br />[MUSIC PLAYING] We’ve
					already mentioned that, in Scrum, the project manager is most likely playing the role of Scrum
					Master.<br />So what exactly does the Scrum Master role entail?<br />In this video, I’ll further
					define
					what a Scrum Master is.<br />Then I’ll explain some of the differences and similarities between a
					Scrum
					Master and a project manager.<br />The Scrum Master promotes and supports the Scrum process by
					helping
					everyone understand and implement Scrum.<br />This includes its practices, rules, and
					values.<br />My
					favorite way to describe the role of a Scrum Master is that they’re responsible for helping the team
					be
					their very best.<br />They can achieve this by coaching individuals on the team to manage external
					forces, as well as maximizing the team’s internal potential.<br />For example, let’s say that
					Virtual
					Verde keeps getting error reports about the shopping cart feature on their new website
					page.<br />The
					Scrum Master is there to notice the pattern and help the team find a better solution, rather than
					just
					fixing one error at a time.<br />Maybe a special test plan is needed, or extra solution reviews for
					that
					feature are needed before changes are released.<br />The Scrum Master’s responsibilities include
					coaching team members on the Agile and Scrum practices, rules, and values, and helping to find ways
					to
					manage the product backlog effectively.<br />The product backlog is the single authoritative source
					for
					things that a team works on.<br />It contains all of the product features, product requirements, and
					activities associated with deliverables to achieve the goal of the project.<br />The Scrum Master
					facilitates Scrum events, such as Sprint retrospectives, which happen at the end of every
					sprint.<br />The Scrum Master helps the team remove any blockers to their progress, such as missing
					information or access to training or tools.<br />The Scrum Master also prevents unhelpful
					interactions
					or interruptions coming from outside of the team.<br />At this point, you may be wondering, how am I
					going to do all of that?<br />Well, you probably already have many of the traits that Scrum Masters
					need
					to execute these tasks.<br />A Scrum Master is required to be organized and supportive as they
					lead.<br />They’re also facilitators, coaches, and great communicators.<br />Let’s find out how
					these
					traits are helpful in a Scrum Master’s role.<br />Scrum Masters must have good organizational skills
					that help them to effectively organize project artifacts and manage Scrum events.<br />Scrum Masters
					must be supportive leaders who focus on the needs of others and the needs of the team before their
					individual needs.<br />They’re not aiming to raise themselves up as a manager of the team who bosses
					people around.<br />Rather, they’re always asking questions like, how can I help, or what would help
					the
					team go forward on this project.<br />Scrum Masters facilitate productivity and
					collaboration.<br />This
					is a critical skill to ensuring every team member’s voice is heard and that their input is
					addressed.<br />Scrum Masters must coach team members on Scrum theory and application.<br />Coaching
					is
					a skill that encourages dialogue and discussion, over simply giving the answers
					directly.<br />Finally,
					Scrum Masters must be great communicators, particularly when it comes to stakeholders.<br />Scrum
					Master
					are experienced in engaging with diverse stakeholders who may have competing perspectives and
					styles.<br />A Scrum Master who can relate to many different types of people is a powerful and
					essential
					teammate to have on a project.<br />You’re probably wondering if the role of a Scrum Master differs
					from
					a traditional project manager.<br />The answer is yes.<br />The two roles can be quite different,
					although, they may be played by the same individual and require a similar skill set.<br />As their
					primary responsibility, the Scrum Master acts as a facilitator and a coach to the Scrum team, and
					they
					need to make sure that they have enough time in the day to do this job first and foremost.<br />If
					the
					company requires the management of many additional project management activities, then the team
					might
					hire project managers who own that more traditional project management oriented work.<br />That work
					may
					include things like budget management, risk spreadsheets, or Gantt charts.<br />But as I’ve said,
					it’s
					common for traditional project managers to take on the role of a Scrum Master.<br />They rely
					heavily on
					things like decision-making, communicating, flexibility, organizational skills, and more.<br />And
					the
					position of Scrum Master is a natural fit for many of us as project managers.<br />Now a bit more
					about
					the pillars and the role of the Scrum Master.<br />To recap, a Scrum Master must possess skills like
					organization, leadership, the ability to facilitate, coach, and manage stakeholders.<br />And a
					Scrum
					Master can be quite different from a project manager in terms of their responsibilities.<br />But
					the
					role may be played by the same individual, since they require a similar skill set.<br />[MUSIC
					PLAYING]
					A product owner is tasked with ensuring that the team is building the right product or
					service.<br />An
					efficient Scrum team isn’t useful to anyone if they’re creating a product that users don’t
					want.<br />The product owner ensures that the team is building the right thing.<br />A product owner
					is
					responsible for continuously maximizing the value of the product delivered by the Scrum
					team.<br />Their
					key activity is acting as the voice of the customer within the team.<br />They represent and express
					this voice through their ownership of the product backlog.<br />As a quick reminder, the product
					backlog
					is the single authoritative source for things that a Scrum team works on to achieve the project
					goal.<br />The product owner’s responsibilities also include helping the Scrum team understand why
					their
					work matters within the overall goal and mission.<br />They also prioritize the product backlog to
					optimize the delivery of goals and deliver value to customers.<br />The product owner ensures that
					the
					product backlog is visible and transparent to all.<br />And finally, they’re responsible for making
					sure
					that the product or service fulfills the customer’s needs.<br />Phew, that’s a lot.<br />So how do
					product owners accomplish all of that?<br />They rely on their key character traits.<br />A product
					owner’s role requires them to be customer focused.<br />So they must understand a customer’s needs
					and
					the industry of their business extremely well.<br />Product owners also have to be decisive, great
					communicators, and understand both sides of the issue so they can defend their decisions to the
					team.<br />They must be flexible and open to new information that could generate a profitable change
					for
					the team.<br />They also have to be optimistic and positive, especially since they’re delivering the
					product vision to the team, and they must inspire the team to believe in their mission.<br />Product
					owners also have to be available.<br />The iterative nature of Scrum means that the team needs the
					product owner to help inspect, adapt, and plan the next iteration on a regular basis.<br />And
					finally,
					they must be collaborative.<br />Product owners will have to work with their team to ensure that the
					customer’s needs are met, and that will require meeting with and working alongside several
					stakeholders.<br />So as you may have noticed, the product owners are responsible for a lot of the
					project, just like the Scrum Master.<br />Let’s imagine an example of how a product owner will work
					within Virtual Verde.<br />For example, let’s say that the Virtual Verde product owner told the
					development team that they need to work on the following features in this order– flower
					arrangements,
					potted succulents, large potted plants, and herb gardens.<br />When the development team reviews the
					list, they tell the product owner that herb gardens originally sounded difficult to deliver because
					they’re considered regulated food items.<br />But in reality, the vendor specialist on the
					development
					team knows that herb gardens are actually way easier than we thought because our vendor already has
					many
					herb gardens in stock.<br />So the development team suggests focusing on herb gardens first.<br />A
					product owner who is flexible and customer focused will adjust the priorities based on this new
					information.<br />So to recap, we discussed that a product owner acts as the voice of the customer
					and
					is customer focused, decisive, flexible, optimistic, available, and collaborative.<br />Next up,
					we’ll
					discuss the role and traits of the development team.<br />[MUSIC PLAYING] The development team is
					made
					up of the people who do the work to build the product.<br />The size of the team ranges from three
					to
					nine people.<br />This ensures that the team is small enough to remain nimble, but large enough to
					complete significant work within each Sprint.<br />Getting the team size just right is
					important.<br />Smaller teams can struggle with diversity of skills and ideas, while larger teams
					may
					run into issues where there are too many opinions and streams of communication.<br />The development
					team should be cross-functional, so they’re capable of building the product or service in house,
					since
					the team has all of the required skills.<br />The development team also owns their processes and
					structures.<br />So they have to be self-organizing, and can’t rely on others to tell them how to
					organize.<br />They continuously operate as a team rather than individuals.<br />And they support
					each
					other in reaching the team’s goals.<br />Lastly, the development team acknowledges that the best
					products emerge from teams who are customer-oriented, and focus on the user when building their
					products.<br />Many Scrum teams prefer to be co-located, meaning they work alongside each other in
					the
					same physical space.<br />Many believe the team delivers higher quality work and improves faster if
					they
					are co-located.<br />But this isn’t always possible for every team.<br />Let’s take a look at an
					example.<br />Let’s say that the Virtual Verde team discovers an issue with one of their plant
					vendors.<br />They can’t make the holiday rush due to some product quality issues.<br />The quality
					assurance specialist on the team can fly a across the country and help the vendor, but that means
					they
					won’t be available to complete their assigned tasks.<br />If the team is co-located, they can
					quickly
					huddle in a conference room and write out some ideas to either get the work done or rearrange the
					work,
					so this doesn’t impact the Sprint goals.<br />If they don’t sit together or work in different time
					zones, this collaboration is a bit harder.<br />It has to be done over phone or email, or you’ll
					have to
					coordinate the schedules for a meeting.<br />And you might have to come up with workarounds that
					ultimately lead to overall project delays.<br />On the flip side, we live in a world where working
					virtually is possible.<br />So if the quality assurance specialist needs to be on a call, they can
					dial
					in or join via video conferencing platform like Zoom or Skype.<br />Both co-locating and working
					virtually has its benefits and drawbacks.<br />So make sure to use whichever method is best for your
					team.<br />At this point, we’ve covered each role within a Scrum team.<br />A product owner is
					responsible for meeting customer’s needs, also known as “building the right thing.” A development
					team
					is responsible for creating the product, also known as “building the thing right.” The Scrum Master
					is
					responsible for improving efficiency, also known as “building the thing fast.” We know that each
					role is
					vitally important to achieving the goals of a Scrum project.<br />No individual is more or less
					important than the others.<br />They all work together as a team to create value for their users and
					customers.<br />ROWENA: Congratulations on finishing this video in the Google Project Management
