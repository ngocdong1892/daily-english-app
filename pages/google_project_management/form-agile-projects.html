					understand VUCA as it relates to project management.<br />When we get started on a new project, it’s
					helpful to examine the environment and conditions in which the project exists before we decide the
					best
					approach to use.<br />If your project environment has high levels of volatility, uncertainty,
					complexity
					and ambiguity, then it’s a good sign that you should consider an Agile approach.<br />While an Agile
					approach is not a perfect solution that will get rid of VUCA, it will lead to better outcomes by
					giving
					you and your team tools and systems to mitigate the risks that VUCA presents.<br />When you consider
					Agile values and principles, it’s clear that Agile is a proven and well-documented solution to the
					challenges VUCA presents to your project.<br />OK, let’s revisit the Office Green scenario we
					introduced
					earlier in the program.<br />We’ll use this scenario throughout this course as well to illustrate
					the
					power of an Agile approach to project management.<br />If you’re just joining us now, I’ll give you
					a
					quick recap.<br />In previous courses, learners acted as the lead project manager at Office Green,
					LLC,
					a commercial landscaping company focused on interior plant design for offices, restaurants, and
					hotels.<br />For this Agile course, we’ll come back to Office Green as they pursue a new business
					opportunity.<br />The Office Green market research team noticed a major shift to more workers
					setting up
					and working from a home office.<br />They wanted to react fast to a potentially huge market
					opportunity
					and not lose revenue if businesses had less need for their previous office service.<br />Instead of
					offering indoor landscaping designs for businesses, Office Green wants to find a way to capture this
					new
					market full of home offices.<br />I don’t know about you all, but I have a hard time keeping plants
					alive.<br />I can’t keep a cactus alive.<br />But I love all those video conference backgrounds that
					are
					so nicely decorated with beautiful live plants.<br />This shift to working from home came about
					suddenly, so Office Green didn’t have any project plans to start from.<br />They didn’t have time to
					do
					a lot of prep work, but they wanted to maximize this opportunity before it was too late.<br />To do
					this, Office Green assigned you to be the project manager of a scrappy new Agile team.<br />Your
					goal is
					to deliver their new service called Virtual Verde.<br />What environment did Office Green
					face?<br />Volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity.<br />They experienced volatility in
					the
					form of a major disruptive change to their business plans; uncertainty through a lack of
					predictability
					which made it difficult to create concrete plans for the future; a high level of complexity due to
					interrelated factors like suppliers and the economy; and they experienced ambiguity by not being
					able to
					determine or control what might cause future changes.<br />By using an Agile approach to their
					project,
					Office Green was able to address high VUCA factors that were affecting their business.<br />Instead
					of
					business slowly or quickly eroding due to market forces, Office Green embraced the changing market
					and
					remained flexible in how they approach their next project.<br /></p>
