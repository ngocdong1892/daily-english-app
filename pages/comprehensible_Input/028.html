					Are you ready to learn some real life English comprehensible info? Well, good because today we're
					going to explore Indian, Pakistani, Afghan culture here in the United States. Today, we're going to
					explore Little India. Let's go. All right, guys. So, one thing you'll notice here in Little India,
					there's jewelry stores everywhere. Jewelry store, jewelry store, jewelry store. Show over here,
					baby. More jewelry stores. And this is because in Indian culture gold is highly valued one as a safe
					place to invest and store your money but also spiritually they think that it cleanses you, blesses
					you and brings you good fortune. But it's really a way that you can invest your wealth and pass it
					down to your children and your children's children. Something interesting here. We can see some
					traditional Indian clothing. This is for the women. That's for the men. This is something very
					beautiful about that culture. You can see all the attention to detail..<br>
					Somebody worked very hard to make this beautiful clothing. They would use something like this for
					special events, special celebrations such as weddings, which are a big celebration in Indian
					culture. Here we can see some more beautiful traditional clothing. There's tons of stores like this.
					Now guys, weddings, Indian weddings are not like American weddings. Indian weddings can last several
					days with hundreds of people and can cost from $50,000 to $200,000..<br>
					It is a huge day in the life of an Indian person. Okay, guys. So, we had some delicious Indian food
					for lunch. I thought it was really good. It's a little bit spicy for my wife, but I loved it. The
					naan was delicious. We tried chicken biryani and niari Pakistani stew and it was absolutely
					incredible. The broth was delicious. So Indian cuisine is interesting. It's very colorful due to the
					different spices that they use. But it's not just for flavor. They actually use spices that are good
					for your health. Another interesting thing about Indian cuisine is that a lot of it is vegetarian.
					Vegetarian means that they do not eat meat. It's all vegetables, fruits, grains, things like that.
					And the reason for this, well, there's a couple of reasons. One is religion. In Hinduism, some
					Buddhists and Janism, they don't want to harm or kill any other life form. For that reason, they
					don't eat animals. Another interesting thing about Indian cuisine is like our Muslim friends, many
					of them eat only with their right hand for cleanliness reasons. They eat directly with their fingers
					like this. All right, guys. We had our lunch. Let's go try some Indian dessert. Okay, guys. We're
					going to try our dessert. We've got this pasta bari pistachio. Almost looks like fudge.
					Camera wife picked this out. So, let's see if she made a good choice..<br>
					I like it.
					I like it. It's not extra sweet. Tastes pistachios. Pretty good. That tastes like a blaz. And this
					one, lad.
					[Music] So, guys, this one's really interesting.
					It has some a lot of spices in it. Has a spice called cardamom, spice called saffron, which is a
					very expensive spice.
					I think it's okay. I like the pistachio one better. And we've got Connor down there, my son. Conor,
					how's your cake?.<br>
					Good.
					Scale of 1 to 10.
					No problem with that.
					So, he says on a scale of 1 to 10, that cake is a 10,000. Must be some good cake. All right, guys.
					Let's see if we can find something else to show you.
					Okay, guys. We got a little souvenir.
					This beautiful elephant. Camera wife and I went into this little store that had objects like this,
					religious items, Hindu, Buddhist, many beautiful little things like this. And my vision is soon I'll
					make a studio space in my home and I'll get little things like this and decorate the studio with
					cool little objects from all around the world to represent the cultures of all my viewers. But let's
					talk a little bit about why this is special..<br>
					In Indian culture, elephants are seen as a symbol of strength, wisdom, and loyalty. And in the Hindu
					religion, one of the most beloved Hindu gods, Lord Ganesha has the head, the head of an elephant.
					He's their god of new beginnings, the remover of obstacles, and he is worshiped before any major
					event or journey. But for us, it's just a nice decoration and a beautiful symbol of Indian culture.
					So, we picked it up..<br>
					Show me. All right, guys. This is called an auto rickshaw or a tuk tuk and it is a very traditional
					form of transportation in India. Basically, that's an Indian taxi. All right, guys.
					So, I'm back home. We had a ton of fun exploring Little India. It's super interesting. I've been
					going to Chicago for years. I've lived very close to the city of Chicago all my life, and I never
					knew that Little India even existed..<br>
					It's really cool how there's these different neighborhoods, these different little sections in the
					big city of Chicago where you can go and explore a completely different culture. But you may be
					thinking, how did a place like Little India even happen in a big city in the United States? How did
					one street in the city of Chicago, Devon Avenue is the street, how did that become so full of Indian
					businesses? And why did so many people from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, all these countries come to
					this one area in Chicago? Well, it's actually pretty interesting. Well, the reason is because in the
					year 1965, the United States changed a very important immigration law. It was called the Immigration
					and Nationality Act of 1965. And what this did was change a law that basically only allowed white
					European immigrants into the United States. And the thing that this law changed was to start
					allowing people from all over the world as long as they were qualified people. Meaning they were
					smart, they were educated, and they had something to offer the country. This led to a wave of South
					Asian immigrants from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh. Many of them were highly educated and successful
					in their own countries. They were doctors, lawyers, businessmen. They began settling around Devon
					Avenue in Chicago because there was affordable homes there. It was very close to the big city and
					there was transportation such as trains and buses. Now, it started out small with just a couple of
					the grocery stores, restaurants and sari shops. The sari is the traditional Indian dress. But then
					these people started telling their family members..<br>
					Those family members started telling their family members and everybody just kept coming until it
					grew and grew and grew until what you see today. One street full of South Asian restaurants,
					clothing stores, religious buildings, we saw temples, we saw Islamic bookstores.
					There is everything there guys. And it was really interesting. There were so many people walking
					around in the traditional Indian dress. people walking around in traditional Muslim clothing like
					women in burkas, things like that..<br>
					And there was really very few people that look like me there. The people were friendly, the food was
					delicious, and we had a fun time exploring a new culture..<br>
					And to tell you guys the truth, it really made me want to explore that part of the world one day and
					to learn more about the culture. So guys, let me tell you a couple things about Indian culture that
					have impacted my life. Things that I have practiced, things that have had a huge impact on my
					mindset and my health that come from India and the surrounding regions. First, yoga.
					Namaste. So guys, yoga, the word yoga actually comes from a Sanskrit word which means unity, the
					uniting of your body, your mind and your soul. And yoga, the practice of yoga originated in ancient
					India more than 5,000 years ago..<br>
					It was developed as a spiritual practice to help you with your meditation and help you to align with
					the divine. And yoga is not just doing stretches like many people in the west may think.
					There's actually a lot of different parts to yoga. Some of these things are ethical or moral
					principles and ideas..<br>
					One big part is the postures or the positions. Breathing plays a big part which I'm going to talk
					about in a minute. Concentration and meditation..<br>
					Now, yoga was started or invented more than 5,000 years ago, but it still to this day plays a huge
					part in Indian culture and is practiced by millions of people of all ages and homes, temples, parks
					all over the world really, but especially in India. And like I said, western places, western
					countries, people in the west generally think of yoga as an exercise or a physical practice for your
					body. But in India, it is still viewed as a spiritual path to well-being, health, and spiritual
					growth. I read a book about yoga and I really enjoyed learning the spiritual side of it, how it ties
					in with the Hindu religion. I found I found that very interesting and I enjoy the physical parts. I
					think it's a wonderful thing that you can do for both your body and your mind. So I'm very grateful
					for the role that this piece this huge piece of Indian culture has played in my life.
					The next thing that has played an even bigger role in my life from Indian culture is breath work.
					Breathing breath work. Now our Indian friends may know this as pranayyama. In the west it was made
					famous by somebody who I really like Wimhof. He's awesome and he is where I learned about breathing
					exercises for the first time. Later I learned more about pranayyama. So Wimhof has a Wimhof
					technique and the breathing is a deep breath in you release it. Deep breath in you release it. You
					do that 30 times and then you hold your breath..<br>
					Wimhof breathing looks like this.
					[Applause] Wimhof breathing is awesome. You feel so good after you do it. And I did it for several
					months. And guys, it had a huge impact on my health. Guys, I did not run for a long time. All I did
					was wimhoff breathing and then I went for a run. I ran for like three or four miles which would be
					what 5 kilometers, six kilometers and I was not sweating. I was not breathing heavy. It was easy
					because Wimhof breathing had my respiratory system, my breathing and my circulatory system, my blood
					working so well, guys..<br>
					I could not believe how how much that impacted my my physical health and endurance. It was
					incredible. But there are other pranayyama techniques that I've done as well that I've learned about
					through reading and watching things online. One of them is alternate nostril breathing. So guys,
					this is your nose in English. This part is your nose..<br>
					The holes are your nostrils. So alternate alternate means going back and forth. So alternate nostril
					breathing is breathing through one and then switching or alternating to the other.
					That's alternate alternate nostril breathing and that is supposed to align your body. All I know is
					that it feels really good. Another one is called billow breathing. It's like this where you're
					pushing all the air out of you. Uh, I usually do that 40 times and then hold my breath. And the last
					one that I learned about from pranayyama that I really liked is called B breathing. B like a bee.
					And you do it like this..<br>
					[Music] And obviously it's called B breathing because it sounds like a what? A B. So guys, you
					breathe in and on the exhale or releasing the air, you make a humming noise in your nose and it
					sounds like a bee..<br>
					Okay guys, those are the two parts of Indian culture that have impacted my life in a big way. Should
					we learn a couple interesting facts about India before we end this video? Okay, interesting fact
					number one about India..<br>
					India has a huge movie production industry known as Bollywood. Bollywood is like Hollywood which we
					have in the United States which is our big movie producing industry. Bollywood is known for its
					bright colors, its romantic love stories and its dancing. And they are a movie making machine, guys.
					They make over 1,000 movies every year. That's impressive. Next interesting fact, there are more
					than 22 official languages in India and more than 1,600 dialects. That means that there are a lot of
					people speaking in different ways in the country of India..<br>
					Next interesting fact, the game chess, chess was invented in India. My son likes chess, so I'm sure
					he's grateful for that contribution from Indian culture. Next interesting fact in India there is a
					temple devoted to rats. It is home to more than 25,000 sacred rats and they are protected and even
					fed by the devotees or the people who are practicing their religion in that temple. And the last the
					last fact that I find quite interesting there is a village an entire village in India that does not
					have doors. I'm not sure if I'm saying this right, but I would guess it's called sha shing napore.
					Well, in Sha Shinapur, homes and even banks do not have doors and locks because they believe that
					the deity deity is like a word for supernatural being or god. They believe that the deity shani
					protects their homes and their belongings. All right, my friends. Thank you for joining us on this
					small adventure into Indian culture. Guys, this was just a very small taste of the huge, huge
					amounts of culture that India has to offer the world. Like I said before, I hope that one day I get
					to go experience it there, meet some Indian friends, try some authentic Indian food, and learn a
					little bit more about this beautiful world that we call home. Thank you guys..<br>
					Thank you so much for spending your time working on your English and learning with me, growing
					together. I appreciate every single one of you. I'll see you in the next video.
