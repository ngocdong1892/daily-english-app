					light okay let me loose and then up back here back here it's just a piece of cloth okay a piece of
					material that I bought on Amazon I'll put a link down below if you're interested okay it's cheap

					that and I'll show you guys all of the the tricks I know to get good lighting okay a good background
					how to edit videos easier if that's interesting for you guys just tell me and I'll I'll happily make
					a video like that okay but today so Stephen I hope that answers your question okay thank you thank
					you for asking me it's a good question I hope that cleared it up for you okay all I also want to say
					is Stephen is only 16 years old 16 years old and already studying English and wants to learn other
					languages Hey Stephen I salute you I salute you okay awesome job keep it up keep on going and one
					day you'll speak English and any other language that you want very well I'm sure of it okay so the
					story of how I learn Spanish where I live in Indiana there are a lot of Mexican people here okay a
					lot a lot a lot of Mexicans live here in the part of Indiana where I live so when I went to school
					there were Mexicans speaking Spanish to each other okay so in school the only Spanish I really
					learned was bad words okay bad words from hearing the Mexicans yelling at each other okay I don't
					want to say them but you guys know okay so I knew a little bit about a little bit of Spanish like
					that bad words from school and then later in my life when I got jobs once I started to work I had
					some Mexican friends there okay when I worked at the pizza place when I worked at the pizza place uh
					the pizza was five dollars five dollars and 35 cents okay one of the Mexicans told me to say that in
					Spanish Cinco so whenever a Mexican person came in and ordered a pizza I would say okay and I
					thought oh I'm speaking Spanish so cool and then later at another job uh a friend of mine when I was
					working really hard he said okay so little things little things I picked up just living here in
					Indiana surrounded by a bunch of Mexicans all right but I could not speak Spanish I could not
					understand when people were speaking I knew maybe 20 words okay maybe 20 words but because I lived
					here and I had Mexican friends there were Mexican people all over the place I always thought it
					would be super cool to learn Spanish so when I was maybe about 20 I started using apps on my phone
					like Duolingo okay I use Duolingo and I would do it every day for 10 minutes and I learned some
					vocabulary vocabulary okay I learned some vocabulary I learned some words how to say a few things
					but the problem with Duolingo is that 10 minutes 10 minutes every day you will never ever you could
					do that for 10 years okay and you will not be able to have a conversation in my opinion okay because
					it's not enough you need more than 10 minutes every day so I was using Duolingo and I found a cool
					podcast a cool podcast called coffee break Spanish and coffee break Spanish was awesome and I
					learned on once again I learned a lot of vocabulary okay and how to say some phrases like where's
					the bathroom is there a good restaurant around here things like that but the problem okay El
					problema the problem with coffee break Spanish is that they were speaking English and telling you
					how to say things in Spanish okay so once again if I listened to coffee break Spanish for 15 minutes
					maybe four minutes of it we're in Spanish okay that is not enough input input input input input okay
					so that was the beginning way back when okay I used applications listened to some podcasts in
					English about how to learn Spanish and uh so I I knew how the language sounded I knew some words but
					I did not know how to speak I could not understand and then I met a Mexican girl okay I met a
					Mexican girl who speaks English and Spanish all right she speaks English just like me because she
					grew up here in the US but her parents uh her mom does not speak English so I met this girl we
					started dating she was my girlfriend okay and when I was with her we spoke in English no problem but
					then I met her parentsis Padres and her dad speaks English cool her dad was awesome we we got along
					good but I could not could not speak with her mom at all okay so I really wanted to I really wanted
					to because her mom seemed really nice and I wanted to speak with her okay of course I wanted to
					speak to my girlfriend's mother so I decided that CD I decided I am going to learn Spanish I have to
					find out how so I started using an app called Babel 10 minutes a day okay I learned some more words
					but I could not speak it was not helping so I started looking on YouTube how to learn Spanish Google
					how to learn Spanish and I finally found italki and italki is great I love italki I love I love I
					love italki so I started using italki and that's when I met my friend Emma and I would do one lesson
					every week with Emma and it was great okay I was speaking she was helping me to learn new words I
					was learning about the culture I was learning about how Spanish works it was great uh the only
					problem the only problem is that it was only once a week and you can't do an italki class at work in
					your car when my son's running around like crazy making a bunch of Noise Okay that was the only
					problem if you could do italki every day for an hour you would learn a lot okay because it's input
					you're getting input from a native speaker so I I talk he's great I learned a lot from Emma and I
					made a great friend I'm honored to call him my friend she's kicking butt at her YouTube channel
					habla con Emma the only problem is that it was only one hour every week okay so you need more input
					input input so one day I was on YouTube looking and looking and looking how to learn Spanish how to
					learn Spanish and one day my life changed okay I found a channel that would change my whole life I
					found a channel on YouTube called Dreaming Spanish okay dreaming Spanish now the man who makes
					dreaming Spanish he's a Spaniard okay he's from Spain and his name is Pablo Roman okay Pablo he
					makes videos like this speaking in Spanish and he talks about his life his experiences talks about
					all kinds of things okay everything you could think of just like I try to do okay and that changed
					my life okay I started with his beginner videos I watched I watched and I watched hours hours hours
					hours okay started with his intermediate hours hours hours I could understand more and more and more
					and I was watching these videos when I was at work when I was at home okay sometimes I would watch
					two three hours every day of dreaming Spanish all right I was getting so much input okay I was
					starting to understand it was like magic so fast and that's when I realized input is the secret
					input input input so I started watching so much streaming Spanish so much so much hours hours hours
					and then at the end of the week when I would speak with Emma I could understand her I could
					understand her okay I could talk more with her and she was like what are you doing how are you
					getting better so fast how it's crazy and it's because I was watching so much I was getting so much
					input input input so I started with his beginner videos then I watched his intermediate videos and
					he even has advanced videos where he just talks normal like he talks with his friends and family if
					any of you guys think that you're ready Stan listos for a video of me just speaking how I normally
					speak tell me tell me and I'll make one okay I'll make one just speaking normal English fast like I
					do with my friends with my family all right I could make one like that for you guys if you're ready
					and then when I could understand when I could understand his uh his intermediate videos and start to
					understand a little bit of his Advanced videos I started watching Netflix with subtitles in Spanish
					and I started watching so much Netflix okay I watched series and series and series and movies I
					think okay I would watch maybe two hours three hours sometimes of series sometimes a movie every day
					in Spanish okay input input input I was getting so much input okay Spanish every day I was listening
					to podcast in Spanish when I was driving to work okay audio books in Spanish I was reading good
					books in Spanish good books that were interesting to me so my mind started to change it started to
					change and a part of my brain became Spanish okay there's a part of my brain that will never change
					for the rest of my life that speaks Spanish okay because I spent so much time on input input input
					okay so at that point I could speak I could understand and then I met a beautiful Colombian woman
					okay I met a beautiful Colombian woman she's my fiance now okay and when I met her she did not speak
					English yet okay now she speaks English so good I'm very proud of her but in that time she did not
					speak English so we spoke Spanish our first date we spoke Spanish for like four or five hours all
					right so we spoke Spanish for four or five hours that was the most Spanish I ever spoke okay so our
					relationship grew and grew we got close we were speaking Spanish every day we text in Spanish okay
					that's just more input more input more input just a huge huge part of my life became Spanish okay I
					fell in love with a woman who speaks Spanish we speak Spanish every day all right I listen to
					Spanish music with her I watch Spanish shows I read Spanish books Okay so you have to make it part
					of your life I made Spanish part of my life now nobody could take that away from me the great secret
					of life is that we become what we think about whatever you think about all day you will become that
					if you think about success you will become successful if you think about speaking English you will
					speak English okay make it part of your life and it will become a part of your life that nobody can
					take away from you okay so tell me guys tell me down below what have you tried when you were
