					ridiculous  foreign I hope you guys are doing great I'm Kyle and here in our Channel pensando
					English the mission is to help you guys with your English with entertaining and useful content so
					today today I am going to talk to you guys about how much how much certain things cost okay so to
					make it interesting I looked up some crazy things okay I looked up how much money some crazy things
					cost and today we are doing this to help you guys with big numbers big numbers in English small
					numbers too because I know I know that for me sometimes really big numbers in Spanish are hard for
					me I forget them So today we're going to work on that in English here we go first the most expensive
					pet okay La Mascota mascara this is a Tibetan Mastiff okay it's a big dog big Chinese dog this dog
					this Chinese dog cost Cuesta it costs 1 million one million five hundred thousand dollars one
					million five hundred thousand dollars for a dog um and they say decent they say that this dog has
					health problems so I don't know why you would spend one million five hundred thousand dollars on a
					big ugly dog that has health problems okay I spend I spent 180 on my dog Oreo del Mundo Clark so I
					spent a hundred and eighty dollars on my dog and I love her okay this this is called a dimple a
					dimple okay I me Kyle I do not have dimples okay I don't have dimples but some people they think
					that dimples are beautiful they're cute they look nice okay so there is a surgery called
					dimpleplasty a surgery called dimpleplasty okay where doctors will make dimples dimples on your face
					okay they will give you dimples with a surgery and this surgery is called dimpleplasty how much do
					you think a dimpleplasty surgery costs well between and three between one thousand five hundred
					dollars and two thousand five hundred dollars okay so for between one thousand five hundred dollars
					and two thousand five hundred dollars you can have some nice dimples okay okay this next one I was
					thinking about hmm what are some interesting things that I could look up so I thought hmm I wonder
					what is the most expensive toilet paper in the world okay papel what is the most expensive toilet
					paper in the world and it turns out that in Japan this toilet paper this toilet paper right here
					that is made in Japan costs 17 for each roll for each roll okay dolares so this roll of toilet paper
					that cost 17 is made in Japan and it is supposed to be very soft soft Suave very soft and it has
					nice designs on it okay they they draw nice designs on it so it looks nice I don't know maybe one
					day I'll order a roll just to see okay to take care of myself because in the last video about about
					self-love I said that you have to take care of yourself okay so maybe maybe I'll spoil myself and
					buy a 17 roll of toilet paper to treat myself good and to show myself that I love me but the truth
					is that the last time that I bought toilet paper I bought this I bought this and this is 30 rolls
					okay 30 rolls and it cost 23 dollars okay so that is less than one dollar each roll and it works
					fine okay ropa interior what is the most expensive underwear that you can buy well this this is made
					by Christian Dior and it cost one thousand six hundred dollars for one pair okay now the thing is I
					think this is pretty ugly okay I would not use that would you guys use that I would not so the most
					expensive underwear that you could buy is one thousand six hundred dollars okay and it looks like
					this now the last time that I bought underwear was 10 years ago so I do not remember what it cost
					okay now we're going to talk about the most expensive cell phone okay the most expensive cell phone
					that you can buy this right here this is called the Supernova iPhone it is covered in 24 karat gold
					and it has a huge huge diamond the Amante has a huge diamond on it okay so how much does the most
					expensive phone in the world cost what do you think what do you think 48 million 500 000 dollars 48
					million five hundred thousand dollars wow phone that I have okay thank you is an iPhone 8 I think
					it's an iPhone 8.
					and the screen is cracked okay but it works I don't use my phone too much I watch YouTube videos on
					it I text that's it it doesn't matter to me my phone okay so the last thing I want to talk about I
					was thinking Hmm I was thinking what is the cheapest thing that you can buy on Amazon and what is
					the most expensive thing that you can buy on Amazon okay so the cheapest thing La Costa masparata
					that you can buy on Amazon is this this is an avocado cutter okay and this cost one penny one cent
					okay one penny but the thing is it's kind of a trick okay because you have to pay for shipping okay
					so really it costs like eight dollars but the price says one cent so what is the most expensive
					thing on Amazon this painting this painting by an artist named ABIA Avila now I have never heard of
					ABIA Avila and I think that my son can paint something like this my son could paint something like
					that but this painting is 10 million dollars 10 million dollars wow okay my friends we talked about
					some things that are very cheap some things that are very expensive and some things that are very
					weird I hope that this video was useful for you guys and I will see you guys very soon
