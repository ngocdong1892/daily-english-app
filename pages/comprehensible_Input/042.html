					Hello my friends hello today we are going to do another video in intermediate English Okay
					intermediate English I am only going to speak English but but I will speak slow slow and clear so
					that you can understand me so today today we you and I we are going to talk about a book okay we're
					going to talk about a book that was written was written by somebody that I think I think you know I
					think you know this person okay today we are going to talk about Mr salus's book okay this book was
					written by the YouTuber the language YouTuber Mr Salas okay so today we are going to talk about his
					book in English from zero to polyglot okay we're going to talk about his book first I want to say
					something about Mr Salas I know that most of you maybe most of you already know this and a lot of
					you guys are here because of Mr Salas but a few months ago Mr Salas he did something very cool very
					cool that helped me a lot all right Mr Salas made a video a YouTube video about language YouTubers
					who deserve more subscribers okay and somehow I have no idea how somehow he found my channel he
					found my channel he put me in the video and he said that you guys should come and check out my
					channel if you are trying to learn English okay he also made a joke about the the name of my channel
					Mr Salas really helped me out okay one day I was at work I looked at my phone and that morning I had
					200 and something subscribers I looked at my phone and I had 600 subscribers okay like that just
					like that because somebody with a big audience and a big YouTube channel he wanted to be a good
					person and he wanted to help others okay and I was lucky enough that for some reason he found my
					channel and decided to help me so uh I want to say gracias Maestro gracias Mr Salas thank you very
					much if you ever see this video I want to tell you thank you I think it was really cool what you did
					and one day when my channel is bigger I want to do the same I want to return the favor to somebody
					else okay super cool what you did I appreciate you and you've got all my respect my friend Okay so
					because Mr Salas did this very nice thing and helped me so much a few months ago I wanted to support
					him in a way okay I want to support him in a small way okay so I bought his book okay I bought his
					book I went to Amazon I found his book and I bought a copy of it and I read it okay I read it
					because I wanted to support in a small way this person who did something so cool for me so today I
					am going to tell you guys some interesting things that I learned from this book but but I am not
					going to tell you all of it because I think it's a good book and if you guys want to know all of it
					you should buy a copy to support Mr Salas too okay because he works hard he worked hard to write
					this so I am not going to tell all of the content that is in here I would not feel right about that
					so I'm only going to tell you guys some of the interesting things that I learned from this book okay
					here we go all right so in the first chapter of this book in the first chapter Mr Salas he breaks
					down okay he describes he describes each level of understanding a language okay from A1 all the way
					to C2 and from Reading each level I think that my Spanish is probably a strong B2 and my French is a
					very weak B1 okay but it's interesting to to read these things and understand your level better I
					think it's a very very useful tool that he included in this book okay and I say that my Spanish is
					probably a B2 because I can defend my points of view I could talk about pretty much any topic okay I
					could live my life in Spanish if I wanted to and I would certainly improve if I spent more time
					speaking in Spanish the next chapter uh describes the differences between being bilingual trilingual
					or a polyglot and this one is interesting and I think that he's right in saying that a lot of the
					times in language learning communities for example polyglot YouTubers or things like that sometimes
					they are very strict in their definitions of what it means to be a polyglot but Mr Salas he says he
					says that if you speak three or more languages you are a poly clap and okay like I said I'm not
					going to go into depth of everything that he said if you want to know all that you gotta buy this
					book but I do find this interesting because my previous understanding was that you had to speak for
					or more languages to be a polyglot but that is because I watched and listened to a lot of these
					perfectionist and sometimes toxic as Mr Salah says language learning YouTubers okay where polyglot
					language YouTubers but I am happy I am happy to read Mr salus's definition because by that
					definition I'ma probably later he touches on how languages are traditionally taught in schools and
					how this is not the most natural or effective method for teaching or learning a language I
					completely agree with this I know personally many people who took four years four years of Spanish
					classes or French classes in high school and they cannot speak French or Spanish not even a little
					bit okay they passed some tests but they could never never go to France go to Mexico go to Colombia
					and have a conversation with a native speaker so that just proves the point that in schools in
					general they do not teach languages right at all they teach grammar a bit of vocabulary but what
					they are teaching you to do is to pass a test and not to understand and be able to really use the
					language in a meaningful way he states he says that it is possible to learn a language on your own
					and it is even preferable it is even better okay and to learn a language by yourself is the best way
					to guarantee your success says Mr Salas and I agree because if you do not have the drive the desire
					to learn a language by yourself and to spend a lot of your own time learning language you will never
					speak a language well so it's important that you take the initiative and you put in a lot of hard
					work on your own or you'll never learn you'll never be able to speak properly and this ties into
					what I said the other day in my video about how in life we we generally we get what we deserve okay
					you you get what you put into something okay so if you spend a lot of your free time working on a
					language you will get what you deserve and after some time working hard you will speak that language
					well the next chapter is great for me because he says he says that the the one true way the true way
					that we learn languages is what is it my friends or in English comprehensible input he goes on to
					say how or how he goes on to explain how we we learn our first our native languages okay and then he
					ties in how therefore for that reason comprehensible input is the most natural and best way to learn
					a language I completely agree it has been my experience that comprehensible input is an incredible
					tool it is the best way that I have found to learn languages comprehensible input is responsible for
					my Spanish and my French and if I were to decide to learn another language the first thing that I
					would search for is comprehensible input whatever language I'm looking for okay for example
					comprehensible input Arabic okay that would be the first step that I took if I was going to learn
					another language he makes one point about comprehensible input that I think is key it is so
					important okay very very important and that is that you must you have to you must enjoy the content
					that you are consuming okay and that is the whole point of my channel pensano English that is the
					whole point okay that is why I try to make my videos interesting I try to talk about interesting
					experiences from my life interesting topics interesting things going around the world I try to make
					them funny funny and fun to watch because I know I know that it is so important that you enjoy the
					things that you are trying to consume it is so important that you enjoy the input that you are
					consuming he then describes how he learned English okay and one one key thing that I took away from
					this chapter was that one thing that played a huge role maybe the biggest role in the language
					learning process for Mr Salas of learning English video games okay Mr Salas first started to learn
					English playing video games and looking in a dictionary okay and this just goes on further to prove
					his point that you must enjoy what you are doing and if you really want really want to understand
					the material that you are consuming is much more powerful and you will be much more motivated so the
					video games Zelda and Mega Man played a huge part in the way that Mr salus learned English now I
					also know what one other person who learned a lot of their English in this way mi amigo Pedro Pedro
					Gomez De Colombia when I spoke to Pedro he also told me that he learned this way and this leads me
					to believe that there is probably a big percentage of young men in this age group who learned a lot
					of English from video games okay who grew up in the 90s I have to imagine that there are many many
					Spanish-speaking or for that matter anybody who did not speak English who learn through video games
					in the 90s there's a whole chapter about his method for learning language and I'm not going to tell
					all of his Secrets you'll have to either go and watch all his videos or buy the book but I will say
					the three points of what Mr Salas calls the input the input Trifecta okay first is to use your free
					time well okay now I have said this many times when you are not doing anything use that time to work
					on your English okay you can watch some of my videos you can watch other videos you could read a
					little bit in English you could listen to a podcast okay do not waste your time if you have to walk
					somewhere put in your headphones and listen to some English use your free time well the second part
					of the input trifecta be constant and disciplined I speak about discipline all the time in my videos
					okay and discipline is one of the most important parts of life whether you want to be successful in
					language learning earning money getting strong getting in shape no matter what it is if you have
					goals discipline is key discipline is so important but especially in language language learning you
					have to be disciplined you have to be constant this means doing a bit every day so doing 30 minutes
					every day will get you a lot farther than doing three hours once a week okay every day we have to
					work and get a little bit closer closer to our goal and the last the third part of the input
					trifecta is we have to adapt to our situation so for example if what you are always doing is
					watching a certain show or series on Netflix in English and it's it's easy for you okay that means
					that it's time to adapt and find a new more difficult content okay or maybe you watch my videos okay
					and you already can understand me well that's great that's great but now maybe you need to try
					watching shows on Netflix okay something a little bit more difficult to adapt and grow to that next
					level okay and at the very end of his book he writes a letter to the reader more or less stating
					thank you so much for reading this book it was difficult to write etc etc but he asked that we
					recommend his book to family and friends that's what I'm doing in this video I recommend that you
					guys check this book out okay it's very interesting very in-depth him death means that he went into
					detail and explained things very thoroughly and after reading this book you will have no doubts that
					Mr Salas understands truly understands the language learning process all right that was a bit of a
					summary about the book some of my thoughts about some of the some of the themes that he discusses in
					this book overall I think it was a good read it was very good for my Spanish because Mr Salas is an
					intelligent person he speaks he uses big words okay um and it was it was good for my vocabulary good
					for my understanding of Spanish and I'm glad that I bought and read this book so another big shout
					out to Mr Salas thank you for what you've done for me my friend one day I hope that we could talk I
					would love to interview you in English talk about languages talk about life one day I think we will
					speak okay my friends pronto
