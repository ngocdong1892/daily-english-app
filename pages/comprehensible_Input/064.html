					episode  hello Kyle my name is Artur result I'm from Mexico City I'm 25 years old I like your
					videos because you helped me with my English with my listening I've learned a lot of new works in
					English thanks for your videos um I want to learn English because I want to talk with another
					country people I want to get a better job I like music in English I would like to understand it I
					want to watch movies in English I would like to travel with another country and know more people
					thanks for your videos because you help us all and saludos is in Mexico okay Arturo wow first I want
					to say thank you thank you so much for taking the time to send me your video it makes me very happy
					to see and I think that you speak great English I think you have a great accent and your
					pronunciation is very good my friend okay your English is very good Arturo and thank you so much for
					taking the time to send me that video okay and made me very happy to see I really appreciate it okay
					anybody else who wants to send me your video speaking in English can send it here and I will put it
					in a video in the future okay it makes me really happy to see you guys doing so well with your
					English Okay so today today I am going to talk about a book that I read okay a very interesting book
					this book okay this book The Four Agreements Los cuatro acuerlos okay and what is this book about
					well this book is about the wisdom of the Toltec people okay the Toltec people were a long long time
					ago long time ago before before the Aztecs okay there was an indigenous people in Mexico called the
					toltecs okay and this book is about four rules okay cuatro reglas that will help your life if you
					always follow these four rules okay now this was a great book I thought it was a great book it's not
					very big there are only 140 pages okay and I read this book and one day okay once I started I did
					not want to put it down okay because I thought it was really good so I kept reading and reading and
					reading and reading okay and while I was reading I was taking notes okay I was taking notes so today
					I'm going to share the notes that I took while I was reading this book with you guys and I really
					love to make videos like this because yes I'm sharing with you guys English that you can understand
					so it's helping with your English but also there's a lot of wisdom wisdom in this book okay Sabi
					Doria so if I can share wisdom with you guys that can help your lives and English we are killing two
					birds with one stone okay we're killing two birds with one stone I think you guys say those pajaros
					con foreign that you make with yourself okay Contigo mismo and if you follow these four agreements
					or four rules your life will improve okay you'll be happier you will have peace of mind you'll have
					better relationships with all the people in your life okay so I think that these these four rules
					are really good to keep in your mind okay and when you think about it you will see like wow they
					they really can help your life if you follow these four rules so the first rule The First Agreement
					from this book be impeccable with your words palabras okay so impeccable impeccable means perfect
					okay so be perfect with your words so what does it mean to be be impeccable with your words well it
					means to always be positive with your words never speak negatively about anybody else okay don't
					insult people now why why is this important it's important because when you are speaking negativity
					there's negativity in your mind okay you're not hurting okay you're hurting yourself with that
					negativity in your mind so it's always important to think and do not speak negative negative things
					about other people okay so this means don't insult other people and something that is going to be a
					little bit difficult for my my Latina Amigas okay  don't gossip don't gossip okay I know I
					know I know but uh uh sometimes all of us can be a little bit too small Source okay so two gossip
					has Ser chismoso or chismos okay but this book says it's important to not gossip no Seas chismosa
					okay because when you're talking about other people you're usually saying bad things negative things
					about them okay and if you're talking about the negative things in their lives and judging them okay
					you're bringing that negativity to you so you should speak about positivity about love okay and
					something that I've tried to do okay I'm trying not to say bad words okay Pala brought us I'm trying
					not to say bad words anymore because that's that's negativity you do not sound intelligent
					intelligente when you're saying bad words all the time okay so I'm trying to cut that out I don't
					want to be cussing I want to speak positivity okay I want to motivate people I want to help people I
					don't want to say bad things and hurt people and there's a part of the Bible that uh for my
					Christian friends Mis Amigos cristianos lest ye be judged okay and that means no no who's guess and
					you will not be judged okay is to judge so do not judge other people and you will not be judged all
					right that's basically what this rule is saying so the second agreement don't take anything
					personally okay so don't take anything personally what does it mean to take something personally
					well to take something personally is if you say Kyle your videos are not good and I get sad oh they
					don't like my videos okay that would be me taking it personally so you should not take things
					personally okay because people who are being negative who say negative things they are being
					negative because they have negativity in their minds and in their lives it is their problem it is
					not your problem okay so if you tell me Kyle your videos are not good I don't like them I will say
					well I'm sorry that you don't like them but you can go and look for other videos okay because I'm
					here to help people and I am helping a lot of people so it does not matter no me importa what one
					person says negatively about my stuff okay because I'm not going to take it personally so if
					somebody says something mean about you don't take it personally okay don't take it personally they
					are probably having a bad day or maybe they've had a long bad life okay and they're a negative
					person so don't take it personally don't take it personally if somebody says bad things to you and
					the book the book even says don't take your own thoughts personally okay so if you have bad thoughts
					sometimes don't take it personally don't let it bother you okay keep on moving and keep on following
					these four rules okay so agreement number three do not make assumptions do not make assumptions so
					what is it to make assumptions okay what is it to make assumptions to make assumptions is to to
					think that you know what somebody else is thinking that's like an assumption okay so if I think oh
					that person does not like me but they never told me they don't like me I'm assuming okay really
					maybe they're just not a very friendly person okay so never make assumptions so how can you put this
					rule into your life have the courage to ask for what you want okay speak your mind okay speak about
					what you're thinking and if you do not know what somebody else is thinking or what their opinion is
					ask them okay so this rule in particular can be very helpful for relationships okay and I have found
					that this rule has helped my relationship with my fiance very much okay we have improved our
					communication a lot by basically using this rule so instead investe instead of thinking oh I don't
					think she would want to do that so I'm not even going to ask her or I think that she should be doing
					these things for me but she's not doing them no tell your partner tell them what you want what you
					need what you think okay and there will not be assumptions so how my fiance and I we use this rule
					we always tell the other one we always tell each other what we're thinking okay so if I want
					something out of the relationship okay I tell her if she wants me to change something or to try
					harder to be good at this part of the relationship she tells me okay so we communicate we tell each
					other what we want and what we need we do not assume okay okay and this one is great this is great
					at work okay with your co-workers if you think that somebody is not doing their job and is making
					your job harder don't just get mad and don't assume that they're a bad person talk to them okay tell
					them hey uh how about if you do this part and I do this part and we can work together better all
					right so don't make assumptions this one's very very important all right number four the last
					agreement always do your best as Los Siempre no mejor que puedas so this one is important okay we
					all have things that we regret we all have things that we regret okay we all have things that we
					regret now a lot of these things that we regret we regret them because we did not do our best in
					that time okay if you always do your best you will not have more regrets so always do your best to
					try and help somebody do your best to try and be a good friend okay and then later if the
					relationship doesn't work okay or you know whatever you were working on fails you will not regret it
					because at least you did everything that you could okay you did your best and you will have a lot of
					good opportunities you'll find more opportunities opportunities in your life when you give it your
					all okay when you're always doing your best this could be at work always doing your best to do a
					good job okay maybe you'll earn more money maybe you'll get new new uh a new position at work okay
					this means to treat yourself the best that you can do your best to be clean to eat the best food
					that you can eat to exercise okay do your best if you do your best you will feel good you will be
					happy and you will be a positive person okay and if you do your very best every day you're going to
					improve over time and have a much better life okay so those were the four agreements Los cuatro
					acuerdos from this book I hope that you guys learned something I hope that you heard and understood
					my English okay thank you my friends thank you for your comments that you guys always tell me okay I
					really appreciate it I appreciate you guys that have sent me your videos that made me very happy to
					watch okay thank you so much guys I'm gonna keep on going three videos a week and I hope you guys
