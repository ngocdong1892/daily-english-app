					differente is foreign Libro that way most terminal okay let's see if this is a good book so this
					book is called the Curious incident of the dog in the night time okay and this is a book about a
					young man a boy who has autism autism and he is trying to solve a mystery okay that's all that I
					know about this book first I'll read you guys the little summary resumen on the back Christopher
					John Francis Boone knows all the countries of the world and their capitals and every prime number up
					to seven thousand fifty Seven he relates well to animals but has no understanding of human emotions
					he cannot stand to be touched and he detest the color yellow this improbable story of Christopher's
					quest to investigate the suspicious death of a neighborhood dog makes for one of the most
					captivating unusual and widely heralded novels in recent years okay sounds pretty good sounds pretty
					good let's see let's see if it's a good book it was seven minutes after midnight the dog was lying
					on the grass in the middle of the lawn in front of Mrs Shear's house its eyes were closed it looked
					as if it was running on its side the way dogs run when they think they are chasing a cat in a dream
					but the dog was not running or asleep the dog was dead there was a garden Fork sticking out of the
					dog the points of the fork must have gone all the way through the dog and into the ground because
					the fork had not fallen over I decided that the dog was probably killed with the fork because I
					could not see any other wounds in the dog and I do not think he would stick a garden Fork into a dog
					after it had died for some other reason like cancer for example or a road accident but I could not
					be certain about this I went through Mrs Shear's gate closing it behind me I walked onto her lawn
					and knelt beside the dog I put my hand on the muzzle of the dog it was still warm the dog was called
					Wellington it belonged to Mrs shears who was our friend she lived on the opposite side of the road
					two houses to the left Wallington was a poodle not one of the small poodles that have hairstyles but
					a big poodle it had curly black fur but when you got close you could see that the skin underneath
					the fur was a very pale yellow like chicken stroke I stroked Wellington and wondered who had killed
					him and why my name is Christopher John Francis Boone I know all the countries of the world and
					their Capital Cities and every prime number up to 7057.
					eight years ago when I first met xiaoban she showed me this picture and I knew that it meant sad
					which is what I felt when I found the dead dog then she showed me this picture and I knew it meant
					happy like when I'm reading about the Apollo space missions or when I'm still awake at 3am or 4 a.m
					in the morning and I can walk up and down the street and pretend that I am the only person in the
					whole world then she drew some other pictures but I was unable to say what these meant I got xiaoban
					to draw lots of these faces and then write down next to them exactly what they meant I kept the
					piece of paper in my pocket and took it out when I didn't understand what someone was saying but it
					was very difficult to decide which of the diagrams was most like the face they were making because
					people's faces move very quickly when I told shoban that I was doing this she got out a pencil and
					another piece of paper and said it probably made people feel very hmm and then she laughed so I tore
					the original piece of paper up and threw it away and shelbon apologized and now if I don't know what
					someone is saying I asked them what they mean or I walk away now this word where is it it's a name
					it's a weird name but it's a name I pulled the fork out of the dog and lifted him into my arms and
					hugged him he was leaking blood from the four coals I like dogs you know you always know what a dog
					is thinking it has four modes happy sad cross and concentrating also dogs are faithful and they do
					not tell lies because they cannot talk I had been hugging the dog for four minutes when I heard
					screaming I looked up and saw Mrs shears running towards me from the patio she was wearing pajamas
					and a house coat her toenails were painted bright pink and she had no shoes on she was shouting okay
					guys it says a bad word here says a bad word okay I'm gonna say it because it's part of the book but
					it's a bad word what in fox name have you done to my dog I do not like people shouting at me it
					makes me scared that they're going to hit me or touch me I do not know what is going to happen let
					go of the dog she shouted let go of the [ __ ] dog for Christ's sake I put the dog down on the lawn
					and moved back two meters she penned down I thought she was going to pick up the dog herself but she
					didn't perhaps she noticed how much blood there was and didn't want to get dirty instead she started
					screaming again I put my hands over my ears and closed my eyes and rolled forward till I was hunched
					with my forehead pressed onto the grass the grass was wet and cold it was nice this is a murder
					mystery novel choban said that I should write something I would want to read myself mostly I read
					books about science and math I do not like proper novels and proper novels people say things like I
					am vain with iron with silver and with streaks of common mud I cannot contract into the firm fists
					with those clench who do not depend on stimulus what does this mean I do not know nor does my father
					nor to shoban or Mr javens I have asked them shoban has long blonde hair and wears glasses which are
					made of green plastic and Mr jeevans smells soap and wears brown shoes that have approximately 60
					tiny circular holes in each of them but I do like murder mystery novels so I am writing a murder
					mystery novel in a murder mystery novel someone has to work out who the murderer is and catch them
					it is a puzzle if it is a good puzzle you can sometimes work out the answer before the end of the
					book Siobhan said that the book should begin with something to grab people's attention that is why I
					started with the dog I also started with the dog because it happened to me and I find it hard to
					imagine things which did not happen to me Siobhan read the first page and said that it was different
					she put this word into inverted commas by making the Wiggly quotation signs with her first and
					second fingers she said that it was usually people who were killed it was usually people who were
					killed and murdered mystery novels I said that two dogs were killed in the Hound of Baskervilles the
					Hound itself and James mortimer's spaniel but Shaban said they weren't victims of the murder Sir
					Charles Baskerville was she said that this was because readers cared more about people than dogs so
					if a person was killed in a book readers would want to carry on reading I said that I wanted to
					write about something real and I knew people who had died but I did not know any people who had been
					killed except Mr Paulson Edward's father from school and that was a gliding accident not a murder
					and I didn't really know him I also said that I cared about dogs because they were faithful and
					honest and some dogs were cleverer and more interesting than some people Steve for example who comes
					to school on Thursdays needs help to ease food and could not even fetch his stick Shaban asked me
					not to say this to Steve's mother then the police arrived I like the police they have uniforms and
					numbers and you know what they are meant to be doing there was a policewoman and a policeman the
					policewoman had a little hole in her tights on her left ankle and a red scratch in the middle of the
					hole the policeman had a big Orange Leaf stuck to the bottom of his shoe which was poking out from
					one side policewoman put her arms around Mrs shears and led her back towards the house I lifted my
					head off the grass the policeman squatted down beside me and said would you like to tell me what's
					going on here young man I sat up and I said the dog is dead I got that far he said I said I think
					someone killed the dog how old are you he asked I replied I am 15 years and three months and two
					days and what precisely were you doing in the garden he asked I was holding the dog I replied and
					why were you holding the dog he asked this was a difficult question it was something I wanted to do
					I liked dogs it made me sad to see that the dog was dead I like policemen too and I wanted to answer
					the question properly but the policeman did not give me up did not give me enough time to work out
					the correct answer why were you holding the dog he asked again I like dogs I said did you kill the
					dog he asked I said I did not kill the dog is this your forecast I said no you seem very upset about
					this he said he was asking too many questions and he was asking them too quickly they were stacking
					up in my head like loaves in the factory where Uncle Terry works the factory is a bakery and he
					operates the slicing machine and sometimes the slicer is not working fast enough but bread keeps
					coming and there is a blockage I sometimes think of my mind as a machine but not always a bread
					slicing machine it makes it easier to explain to other people what's going on inside it the
					policeman said I'm going to ask you once again I rolled back onto the lawn and pressed my forehead
					to the ground again and made the noise that father calls groaning I make this noise when there's too
					much information coming into my head from the outside world it is like when you are upset and you
					hold the radio against your ear and you tune it halfway between two stations so that all you get is
					white noise and then you turn the volume up so that all you can hear so that this is all you can
					hear and then you know you are safe because you cannot hear anything else policemen took holding my
					arm and lifted me onto my feet I didn't like him touching me like this and this is when I hit him
					okay guys I'm gonna stop right there for today yeah I hope you guys enjoyed this I think it's a good
					English challenge tell me down below if you like this if you guys like this I'll keep on reading
					this book we'll finish this whole book and get you guys out a lot a lot of input all right I really
					hope this was enjoyable for you guys something a little different I really like I really love to
					read so I would really enjoy reading books to you guys as a form of input because I think that it is
					one of the best ways that we can hear new vocabulary learn new words and really work on our
					comprehension all right my friends
