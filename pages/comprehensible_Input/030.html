					that the food. It looks delicious. I've seen pictures and videos and the food looks delicious. One
					thing that my wife really wants to try there is a really good croissant. A really good croissant.

					week or two weeks, you will be seeing where I go and the fun things that my wife and I do there.
					We're going to be there for three full days. And I'm excited. I like to see new places. And I'm
					excited that I will get a chance to speak a little bit of this language that I definitely need to
					work on. It's not as good as my Spanish. All right, guys. So, maybe you noticed I'm not in the
					studio. It's a beautiful day out here in Indiana, guys..<br>
