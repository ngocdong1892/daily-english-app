				<p id="1cf468a0-53d4-81ed-9882-efe397e56b5f" class="">A project plan can be useful for any project, big
					or
					small, since it helps you document the scope, tasks, milestones, and overall activities of the
					project.<br />At the center of the project plan is the project schedule.<br />The project schedule
					can
					help you estimate the amount of time it will take to complete the project, and it can provide the
					team
					with a way to track the project’s progress against your goals.<br />What goes into a project plan
					may
					vary from company to company, but most plans contain these five basic elements.<br />These are
					tasks,
					milestones, people, documentation, and time.<br />Let’s break those down.<br />A project plan will
					include tasks and milestones, two topics we discussed before.<br />Tasks are activities that need to
					be
					accomplished within a set period of time.<br />They’re assigned to different members of the team
					according to their roles and skills.<br />And milestones are important points within the schedule
					that
					indicate progress.<br />They usually signify the completion of a deliverable or phase of the
					project.<br />A project plan will also include the people working on your team and their
					roles.<br />It’s important that each team member understands their role and the tasks they’re
					responsible for completing.<br />Ensuring that everyone is clear on their assigned task frees you up
					to
					focus on managing the project and creates a sense of personal responsibility for members of the
					team.<br />A project plan is a good place to link to relevant documentation.<br />This includes
					documents like your RACI chart, which helps to define roles and responsibilities for individuals on
					your
					team.<br />You can also link to your charter, which clearly defines the project and outlines the
					details
					needed to reach your goals.<br />Relevant documentation can also include documents like your budget
					and
					risk management plan.<br />We’ll discuss more about those later on in the course.<br />Lastly, a
					project
					plan should include the estimated time that will be spent on the project.<br />This forms the basis
					of
					the schedule, which is the anchor of your project plan.<br />The estimated time includes dates on
					which
					tasks should be started and completed and the dates when you hope to reach various
					milestones.<br />It
					also includes the start and end dates of the project, which are important in determining which
					resources
					you’ll need and when you’ll need them.<br />So how exactly do you estimate how long these things
					will
					take?<br />Meet me in the next video to find out.<br />[MUSIC PLAYING] As the project manager, you
					aren’t responsible for completing every task.<br />What you are responsible for is identifying and
					helping assign those tasks, and then estimating how long they’ll take to complete.<br />These
					estimates
					come together to determine the overall project schedule.<br />So how do you estimate the amount of
					time
					a given task will take?<br />You do this with the help of your team.<br />Time estimation is a
					prediction of the total amount of time required to complete a task.<br />Effort estimation is a
					prediction of the amount and difficulty of active work required to complete a task.<br />Effort
					estimation differs from time estimation in that effort quantifies the amount of time it will take a
					person to complete work on a task.<br />On the flip side, time refers to the overall duration of the
					task from start to finish.<br />That includes inactive time.<br />Here’s an example.<br />The effort
					estimation for painting a wall might be 30 minutes, but time estimation might be 24
					hours.<br />That’s
					because, in addition to the 30 minutes of active painting time, there are also 23 and 1/2 hours of
					inactive drying time.<br />It’s important to understand the difference between time estimation and
					effort estimation because it can help you be more efficient with your available resources.<br />If
					there’s idle time baked into a given task, your teammate is effectively free to do other
					things.<br />A
					painter can do other tasks while the wall is drying, like painting the mailbox or the window
					trim.<br />An unrealistic effort estimate can negatively impact a project schedule.<br />Generally,
					this
					happens when you underestimate the amount of time it will take to complete a task.<br />Often, the
					culprit for underestimating effort is optimism.<br />And listen, optimism is a wonderful trait for a
					project manager to possess, but too much optimism can lead you to overlook potential risks that
					could
					set your plans behind schedule.<br />Though it might be tempting to make the optimistic assumption
					that
					tasks will be executed exactly according to plan, there is always a possibility that there will be
					setbacks.<br />So how do you try to avoid making unrealistic effort estimates?<br />You can do this
					by
					communicating with teammates assigned to each task.<br />Your teammates will have the most realistic
					understanding of the amount of work required to complete a task, and should be able to provide you
					with
					the best estimate.<br />Let’s imagine this scenario in the context of our Plant Pals Project at
					Office
					Green.<br />As a reminder, you’re launching a new service to provide top Office Green customers with
					small, low-maintenance plants that they can place on their desks.<br />You might assume that
					creating a
					contact list of top customers is relatively straightforward and can be completed in a single
					day.<br />But it’s important to really consider certain subtasks required to complete work in your
					planning.<br />Subtasks refer to smaller tasks that are required to complete a larger task.<br />For
					example, this might include meeting with the global sales team to identify clients, gathering
					contact
					information, determining client language preferences, and building a spreadsheet to house this
					information.<br />Asking the teammate assigned to the task for their estimate is likely to yield a
					more
					accurate estimation since they’ll have a deeper understanding of the work and the nuances of what’s
					required to complete the task.<br />You might learn that creating the contact list may take two days
					to
					complete, which could be double the time you originally expected.<br />Of course, you can usually
					ask
					follow-up questions, or even gently push back on their estimate as needed.<br />Later on, we’ll
					discuss
					more of the techniques you can use to get more accurate estimates from your teammates.<br />Now,
					even
					though task owners tend to have the strongest sense of how much time they’ll need to complete a
					task,
					the fact is that effort estimates are just that, estimates– meaning that sometimes those estimates
					won’t
					be accurate.<br />For example, in our Plant Pal scenario, your teammate estimates that it will take
					two
					days to create a contact list of top customers.<br />But let’s say that the sales team is out of the
					office for a team building exercise and unable to meet about the client list until after the
					weekend.<br />This will create a task delay.<br />And as a result, the original estimate is no
					longer
					accurate.<br />Luckily, there’s a helpful tool called a buffer that you can use during the planning
					phase to protect against inaccurate effort estimates.<br />A buffer is extra time added to the end
					of a
					task or a project to account for unexpected slowdowns or delays in work progress.<br />Buffers are
					important because they can provide some leeway just in case your time and effort estimates turn out
					to
					fall a bit short.<br />With a buffer, you can add extra time into your schedule, and your projects
					shouldn’t fall off track when task delays inevitably arise.<br />There are two types of buffers you
					can
					use when planning your scheduled, task buffers and project buffers.<br />First, we have task
					buffers,
					which refer to extra time tacked onto a specific task.<br />Task buffers should be used primarily
					for
					tasks that are out of the project team’s control.<br />For example, you might ask a potential plant
					vendor to provide you with a cost estimate by Monday.<br />You might assign them this deadline
					knowing
					that you won’t actually need the estimate until Thursday.<br />The time between Monday and Thursday
					is
					your buffer, and it provides your team with extra time just in case the vendor sends their estimates
					to
					you a day or two late.<br />Task buffers should be used more sparingly for tasks within the project
					team’s control.<br />For example, you might choose to add buffers only to tasks that are difficult
					to
					complete or that have an element of unpredictability, like the length of time it will take plants to
					grow.<br />Adding a buffer to every task could lengthen your project schedule unnecessarily, leaving
					you, your team, and your stakeholders with an unrealistic timeline.<br />This is where project
					buffers
					come in handy.<br />Project buffers differ from task buffers in that they provide extra time to the
					overall project schedule.<br />Rather than adding a buffer to every task, you can add extra time as
					a
					buffer towards the end of your project schedule, then you can use that extra time, two to three days
					for
					example, as needed throughout the project.<br />For instance, if a teammate misses a deadline here
					and
					there, the project buffer gives you space in the overall schedule to make up for lost time.<br />I
					use
					buffers often in my day to day role at Google.<br />For example, on a recent project at Google, I
					was
					working with a new hire who was great at coding but kept missing deadlines.<br />I realized they
					weren’t
					giving themself enough buffer time to do testing.<br />I started to ask questions about their
					current
					workload and the complexity of their tasks.<br />And based on their answers to those questions, I
					was
					able to gather insights about their work and determine where I needed to add buffer to their
					tasks.<br />Ultimately, my goal is to ensure that I’m setting a realistic timeline for the
					project.<br />After all, if you hit your project goal two months later than expected, your
					organization
					may not consider the project a success.<br />Time estimation, effort estimation, and buffers can
					help
					you build realistic plans for reaching the project goal.<br />[MUSIC PLAYING] So we’ve discussed
					time
					estimation, which is a prediction of the total amount of time that will be required to complete a
					task,
					and we’ve also discussed effort estimation, which is a prediction of the amount and difficulty of
					active
					work required to complete a task.<br />These techniques can help you estimate the length of time it
					will
					take to complete a task.<br />Once you have that information, you need to determine if you have the
					right number of people to get the work done.<br />To figure this out, you can use a technique called
					capacity planning.<br />First, let’s define capacity.<br />Capacity refers to the amount of work
					that
					the people or resources assigned to the project can reasonably complete in a set period of
					time.<br />A
					person can only do so much, and it’s important to keep in mind each person’s capacity when assigning
					work.<br />This is where capacity planning comes in.<br />Capacity planning refers to the act of
					allocating people and resources to project tasks and determining whether or not you have the
					necessary
					resources required to complete the work on time.<br />During this process, you might find that you
					need
					more resources to speed up the project timeline, like a second web developer or a third
					writer.<br />Let’s imagine capacity planning in the context of our Plant Pals Project at Office
					Green.<br />If you know that you’ll need to deliver plants to 100 customers over a period of five
					days,
					then you’ll need to determine if you’ve hired enough delivery drivers to meet that deadline.<br />If
					one
					delivery driver averages 20 deliveries within an eight-hour workday, then you’ll need to hire at
					least
					five drivers to complete their work on time.<br />Even if a person on your project team is spending
					100%
					of their time at work on your project, they’ll have limited capacity for the amount of work they
					should
					be expected to complete each day.<br />Between meetings, unexpected urgent tasks, and other elements
					of
					a typical workday, there’s only so much each person can complete.<br />So how do you decide where a
					teammate should focus their priorities and make the most of their capacity?<br />You can prioritize
					their time by plotting the critical path of your project timeline.<br />The critical path refers to
					the
					list of project milestones that you must reach in order to meet the project goal on schedule, as
					well as
					the mandatory tasks that contribute to the completion of each milestone.<br />Anything else is
					considered off the critical path.<br />For example, tasks on the critical path for launching Project
					Plant Pals might include hiring plant vendors, developing a new website, and fulfilling
					deliveries.<br />A task, like adding flowers to your product lineup, is nice to have, but might not
					have
					much impact on the overall success of your project because this task isn’t crucial to your
					launch.<br />These tasks aren’t part of the critical path.<br />To summarize, your critical path
					includes the bare minimum number of tasks and milestones you need to reach your project
					goal.<br />If
					your team is unable to complete any of those tasks on time, that might result in a project
					delay.<br />To determine the critical path of a project, you’d start by listing all the tasks
					required
					to complete the project and the milestones they feed into.<br />This is a perfect time to think back
					to
					your work breakdown structure or WBS, which is a chart that sorts all the milestones and tasks of a
					project into a hierarchy according to the order in which they need to be completed.<br />This
					includes a
					detailed overview of every project task.<br />Then you determine which tasks on the list absolutely
					can’t begin until another task is complete.<br />This is called a dependency.<br />And we’ll discuss
					this topic in more detail later on.<br />Next, you’ll work with your team to make time estimates for
					each task and map each task from start to finish.<br />The longest path is your critical
					path.<br />There are a few factors that can impact capacity and capacity planning.<br />First, you
					need
					to be able to identify which task can happen in parallel, which means they can happen at the same
					time
					as other tasks.<br />You will also need to identify which task can happen sequentially.<br />Meaning
					they must happen in a specific order.<br />When you identify which task can happen in parallel, it
					helps
					you create efficiencies within your project schedule by demonstrating where you can complete
					multiple
					tasks at the same time.<br />Identifying sequential tasks help you identify the tasks that you need
					to
					prioritize early on in the project.<br />For example, a sequential task for your Plant Pals Project
					may
					include needing budget approval before hiring a vendor.<br />And two parallel tasks might include
					hiring
					delivery drivers and the development of a website.<br />These tasks have no relationship to one
					another
					as they focus on different portions of the project and can be completed by different members of the
					team.<br />That means that one task can begin even if the other task hasn’t been completed, and so
					the
					work to complete these tasks can happen at the same time.<br />You also need to determine which
					project
					tasks have a fixed start date.<br />A fixed start date refers to the date on which you must start
					work
					on your tasks in order to achieve your goal.<br />Identifying whether or not your task have a fixed
					start dates can help with capacity planning because it helps ensure that you’ll have the right
					number of
					people available to complete tasks on time.<br />For example, let’s imagine that your contract says
					you’ll need to deliver 100 plants on a specific date.<br />That means that the task of picking up
					those
					plants has a fixed start date of one day prior to delivery.<br />Alternatively, some tasks might
					have an
					earlier start date.<br />An earlier start date refers to the earliest date in which you can begin
					working on a task.<br />Identifying an earlier start date can set accurate expectations for when
					vendors
					and team members will be up and running on the project.<br />This can help you plan your work and
					prioritize your work accordingly.<br />For example, if you’re working with a new vendor, you need to
					wait until contracts are signed and the purchase order is approved and created before the vendor can
					start.<br />Let’s say that at Office Green this process can take about three weeks.<br />Based on
					this
					information, you can determine that the earliest start date for your vendor will be three weeks from
					the
					kick off meeting with your vendor.<br />Another best practice for capacity planning and creating a
					critical path includes identifying if a task has float, also sometimes known as Slack.<br />Float
					refers
					to the amount of time you can wait to begin a task before it impacts the project schedule and
					threatens
					the project outcome.<br />These are high-priority tasks that have low to no wiggle room.<br />This
					helps
					reinforce what is and what is not on your critical path.<br />For instance, tasks on the critical
					path
					should have zero float.<br />Meaning there is no room for delays.<br />And tasks that do have float
					are
					not a part of the critical path.<br />For example, the shipment of plants to a priority customer
					who’s
					requested their delivery on a specific date is a task that has zero float.<br />Great.<br />You’ve
					now
					learned a bit more about how to define capacity, capacity planning, and critical path.<br />We also
					discussed the techniques used to identify critical path in a project and the various factors that
					can
					impact capacity and capacity planning.<br />[MUSIC PLAYING] Time estimation, effort estimation, and
					capacity planning are all helpful techniques for creating your project schedule.<br />And at the
					center
					of all this planning is your team.<br />Throughout the schedule planning process, you’re working
					with
					teammates to gather estimates, and you’re taking into account each person’s capacity when building
					the
					project schedule.<br />It makes sense to involve your teammates at this stage.<br />After all, the
					person assigned to the given task is likely to have the best sense of how long it will take to
					complete
					that task.<br />They’ll also have the best sense of their own capacity for taking on the
					work.<br />But
					these conversations are a two-way discussion, and you’ll need to tap into your soft skills to get
					the
					most accurate estimate from your team.<br />Soft skills are personal characteristics that help
					people
					work effectively with others.<br />These include crucial communication and interpersonal skills
					we’ve
					discussed over the course of this program.<br />Soft skills can be important when trying to
					understand
					what might be blocking someone’s ability to do their best work.<br />Let’s go over three ways to use
					soft skills and gather accurate estimates from your teammates.<br />These are asking the right
					questions, negotiating effectively, and practicing empathy.<br />Let’s start with asking the right
					questions.<br />Think of conversations around the time estimation as a kind of interview.<br />Your
					connecting with your teammates to learn more about how they work on specific tasks, and you’ll use
					this
					information to build your schedule.<br />To aim to get the most relevant information from these
					conversations, you’ll want to be certain that you’re asking effective, open-ended questions that
					lead to
					the answers you’re seeking.<br />An open-ended question is a question that cannot be answered with a
					yes
					or a no.<br />The answer provides the relevant details of what you need to know.<br />Let’s imagine
					this
					in the context of your project at Office Green.<br />You’ve discussed the design of a new website
					with
					your web designer, and you’d like to know how long it will take them to mock up designs for your
					review.<br />Now let’s say you start the conversation by asking a question like, can you complete
					the
					mock ups in one week?<br />This is a closed-ended question and might elicit a simple yes or no
					answer,
					which doesn’t tell you much about the task of designing a website or about your teammates working
					style.<br />Now, imagine if you had started this conversation with an open-ended question.<br />For
					example, you might ask the web designer something like, how long does it typically take you to mock
					up a
					website design like this one?<br />This is an open-ended question, and is more likely to elicit a
					more
					detailed response.<br />From there, you can ask follow-up questions like, how complex are the steps
					to
					complete this task?<br />What are the risks associated with this task?<br />And when do you think
					you
					can have this ready?<br />By asking your teammates effective, open-ended questions about their
					assigned
					tasks, you can learn more about how they work and what they do.<br />As you have more of these
					conversations, you’ll develop a better sense of your teammates’ roles and their tasks, and you’ll be
					able to rely less on your team to make accurate estimates.<br />Another way to use soft skills to
					gather
					estimates from teammates is to negotiate effectively.<br />Part of your job as the project manager
					is to
					bridge the gap between high-level goals of the project and the day-to-day perspective of your
					team.<br />While your project might be your number one priority, it’s possible that people on your
					project team have competing priorities on other teams to keep track of as well.<br />Negotiating
					effectively can help you influence a team member to make your project their priority by
					collaborating to
					find an outcome that works for everyone.<br />For example, let’s imagine that the website designer
					estimates it will take them two weeks to mock up the website design for review, but perhaps you were
					hoping that their estimate might be closer to one week.<br />To arrive at an estimate that works for
					both you and the designer, you might gently challenge the estimate by asking follow-up
					questions.<br />Perhaps you’d ask if their estimate includes mocking up designs for multiple
					pages.<br />If so, you might ask if the designer is able to share one or two pages with you sooner
					than
					their proposed deadline.<br />By asking questions, you can determine if their estimate is flexible
					or if
					you need to bring in an additional designer to support the schedule.<br />By negotiating effectively
					with your teammates, you can create a sense of shared ownership over the project outcomes and create
					a
					schedule that aligns with everyone’s workload.<br />Now let’s discuss the value of practicing
					empathy.<br />Empathy refers to a person’s ability to relate to the thoughts and feelings of
					others.<br />Practicing empathy at work can be a very effective way to build trust with your
					team.<br />Your teammates are humans, and each person can only do so much.<br />When you’re
					discussing
					estimates with the team, you might practice empathy by asking each person about their workload,
					including work outside of your project and the overall work life balance.<br />You might also ask if
					they’ve scheduled vacation or leave during the duration of the project or if there are crucial
					holidays
					in which they won’t be working.<br />This can help you avoid assigning tasks when teammates are
					unable
					to complete them on time.<br />For example, the web designer might tell you that they’re also
					designing
					a website for another team at Office Green, and that the timeline for both projects overlap.<br />So
					to
					avoid overloading your designer with work, you might work with the other project manager to balance
					workloads across the teams.<br />People like to feel their work is valued.<br />So part of empathy
					is
					remembering to always be appreciative of the work, collaboration, and support that you’re getting
					from
					the team.<br />So to recap, asking the right questions, negotiating effectively, and practicing
					empathy
					can help you get viable, accurate estimates from your teammates about project tasks.<br />Coming up,
					we’ll discuss putting these estimates to good use in the project plan.<br />[MUSIC PLAYING] Even the
					simplest projects can benefit from a clear plan.<br />And an anchor of a good project plan is a
					clear
					schedule containing all the tasks of a project, their owners, and when they need to be
					completed.<br />Once you have your project schedule, you can build a solid plan around that schedule
					using tools like spreadsheets and Asana.<br />We’ll explain these tools in a few moments, but first,
					let’s discuss building a project schedule.<br />There are many helpful tools that you can use to
					create
					a project schedule, but let’s focus on one that we sometimes use here at Google called a Gantt
					chart.<br />A Gantt chart is a horizontal bar chart that maps out a project schedule.<br />Fun fact,
					the
					chart gets its name from American engineer Henry Gantt who helped popularize the chart in the early
					1900s.<br />So why did people working in project management find this chart useful?<br />Well, it’s
					a
					highly visual representation of a project’s tasks with clear breakdowns of who’s responsible for the
					work and when those tasks are due.<br />For many people, a visual aid that builds upon written
					directions can be a helpful way to understand and synthesize the work they need to do, when they
					need to
					complete it, and how their individual tasks connect to the other tasks in a project.<br />Gantt
					charts
					are almost like calendars.<br />They feature the start and end dates of each task, and the bars
					align
					with how much time is devoted to each of those tasks.<br />For example, let’s say that your
					teammate,
					Leon, is tasked with creating a project charter, and another teammate, kylie, is tasked with
					reviewing
					and editing the charter when Leon is finished.<br />Using a Gantt chart, you’ll use colored bars to
					illustrate the days that they’ll be working on these tasks.<br />With this method, you and the rest
					of
					your team can determine that Leon has Friday, Monday, and Tuesday to work on the chart, and Kylie
					has
					Wednesday to complete any revisions.<br />The bars cascade down the chart to illustrate the passing
					of
					time and the blocks of time in which the tasks are completed.<br />Gantt charts can be a helpful
					tool
					for tracking schedules, but what kinds of tools can you use to make a Gantt chart?<br />There are a
					few
					options, but we’re going to focus on the straightforward spreadsheet.<br />Creating a Gantt chart in
					a
					spreadsheet is pretty simple.<br />You can organize your left columns by items like task title, task
					owner, start date, due date, duration, and percent of task complete.<br />This is a great place to
					list
					the tasks and milestones previously identified in a work breakdown structure.<br />You’ll include
					relevant information in the rows below, organized by start date.<br />On the right side of your
					sheet,
					you’ll order your columns by the weeks estimated to complete the project from start to
					finish.<br />In
					the rows below that, you’ll include bars representing the dates when certain tasks will take
					place.<br />Kind of neat, right?<br />Spreadsheets are helpful here because they can hold more
					information than just the Gantt chart.<br />Though the project schedule serves as the central
					component
					of the project plan, you can use separate tabs on your spreadsheet to house or link to other
					documents
					you’ll want to include in your plan, like a RACI chart or a project charter.<br />You may also opt
					to
					include your plans for risk management and communication here too.<br />With a spreadsheet, you can
					simply add a tab for your documents.<br />Keeping every document for the project in one spreadsheet
					saves time, helps everyone stay organized, and reduces the burden of having to search through emails
					for
					information.<br />Alternatively, you can also opt to use a digital document to link out all the
					relevant
					documents.<br />While Gantt charts are a useful tool, they are far from the only option for your
					project
					plan, and there are plenty of reasons why this form of documentation might not work for you or your
					project team.<br />For a simple project, you might find that your team responds better to a digital
					document that features a list of tables or tasks, their owners, due dates, and links to other
					relevant
					planning documents.<br />Or perhaps your team works best with kanban boards, which uses cards to
					track
					and visualize the progress of your tasks.<br />Regardless of your chosen tool, if your plan includes
					the
					project’s goals, its tasks, owners, start and end dates, and relevant planning documentation, then
					you’ll be able to keep everyone on the same page.<br />Now you know a bit more about the tools that
					can
					be used to create a project schedule.<br />[MUSIC PLAYING] Earlier, you learned about creating a
					project
					plan based on a project schedule that lists all of the milestones, tasks, and deadlines of a project
					and
					that clearly outlines the people responsible for each task.<br />You also learn about Gantt charts,
					which are simple visual ways to create your schedule.<br />So how can you help make sure that your
					plan
					works for you and your team?<br />Let’s discuss five best practices for building a great project
					plan
					that will remain useful throughout the execution and closing phases of your project.<br />Those
					include
					ensuring careful review of project deliverables, milestones, and tasks, giving yourself time to
					plan,
					recognizing and planning for the inevitable, things will go wrong, staying curious, and championing
					your
					plan.<br />First you’ll want to ensure that you’ve carefully reviewed the project’s deliverables,
					milestones, and tasks.<br />During the initiation phase, you’ll recall that you created a project
					charter with important information regarding your project, like your goal, scope, and
					deliverables.<br />When a project enters the planning phase, your plans become more
					granular.<br />Let’s
					discuss this in the context of your project at Office Green.<br />In your plan, you need to break
					this
					information down further.<br />You’re creating a new website for the service, so you’ll need to
					break
					that deliverable down into smaller milestones, like kicking off a meeting with the web developer and
					gaining stakeholder approval.<br />And those milestones will break down into smaller tasks, like
					mocking
					up a design of the new website and developing a landing page.<br />Each of these tasks will be
					assigned
					to a teammate and given a start and end date.<br />Now, a new website isn’t the only Project Plant
					Pals’
					deliverable.<br />You will need to break down every deliverable into milestones and tasks to ensure
					that
					you and your team have a clear picture of what needs to be done to meet your project’s
					goals.<br />Your
					plan revolves around completing each and every tiny task, so you should take your time to get this
					piece
					right.<br />This brings me to my second tip, give yourself time to plan.<br />There’s a reason that
					planning is its own phase of the project life cycle.<br />It’s a time-intensive process, especially
					for
					larger projects with multiple deliverables.<br />Planning gives you and your team some time to think
					realistically about your team can and cannot accomplish within a certain time frame.<br />You’re not
					a
					machine and neither are your teammates.<br />There are limits to the amount of work any one person
					can
					do in a given time frame.<br />Using the strategies that we’ve shared earlier, like effort
					estimation
					and capacity planning, can help you and your team get a realistic sense of how long the project will
					take and when you’ll be able to hit your milestones.<br />It’s also important to allow for buffer
					time
					since projects rarely go exactly as planned.<br />Later in the project, you’ll be grateful that you
					initially planned for some built-in flexibility around timing.<br />That leads nicely into my third
					tip,
					recognize and plan for the inevitable, things will go wrong.<br />Even with thorough planning, your
					projects will still experience unexpected setbacks and bumps in the road.<br />You can’t plan for
					every
					problem, but the team can identify the risks that will most likely occur and create plans to prevent
					or
					mitigate those risks.<br />As we mentioned before, buffer is a helpful tool for mitigating issues
					related to slowdowns in progress.<br />You’ll learn more about how to create a risk management plan
					that
					goes into your project plan later on in this course.<br />Onto my fourth tip, stay
					curious.<br />Though
					you may be the sole expert on your project overall, it’s extremely unlikely that you’re an expert on
					every task of the project.<br />That’s why it’s so important to sit down with your teammates during
					a
					planning phase and ask lots and lots of questions.<br />As we mentioned earlier, asking your
					teammates
					questions about their work can give you deeper insights into their tasks for the project.<br />Their
					input will help you build a stronger plan, and the back and forth dialogue will help you build trust
					between you and your teammates.<br />To keep the project running smoothly, it’s also important to
					understand the expectations, priorities, risk assessments, and communication styles of your
					stakeholders
					and vendors.<br />For example, you might ask stakeholders how to best keep them in the loop on the
					project’s plans, and you might ask your vendors about their availability to complete work for the
					project.<br />Now, onto my fifth tip, champion your plan.<br />While deciding how to organize your
					plan,
					you’ll want to ask yourself a few questions, like can your teammates use the tool you used to build
					your
					plan?<br />Is the information clear enough for your stakeholders?<br />Will using this plan as a
					single
					source of truth save your team and stakeholders the time and energy when they need to find
					information
					on the project?<br />If the answer to each of these questions is a strong yes, then you’re on the
					right
					track.<br />To achieve buy in from your teammates and stakeholders on your project plan, champion
					it.<br />Tell your team why it benefits them to stay on top of the plan.<br />By doing so, you may
					influence your teammates to stay on track and update the plan regularly.<br />[MUSIC PLAYING] Nice
					work.<br />Let’s recap what we’ve just covered.<br />First, we took you through why it’s necessary
					to
					create and manage a project plan.<br />At the center of the project plan is a project schedule, and
					we
					discussed methods for determining realistic time and effort estimates for each task.<br />You also
					learnt more about the power of soft skills to help you gather time and effort estimates from members
					of
					your team.<br />We also introduced you to a Gantt chart, which is a useful tool for visualizing a
					project schedule, and I shared my best practices for creating a project plan that will serve as a
					useful
					source of information throughout the planning phase and execution phase.<br />Coming up, we’ll take
					you
					through managing costs and budgets.<br />See you soon.<br />Congratulations on finishing this video
