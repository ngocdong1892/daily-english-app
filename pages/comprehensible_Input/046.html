					hello my friends I'm Kyle welcome back to your home for real and comprehensible English pensano Eng
					where I bring you real and comprehensible English and today I'm going to bring you real and
					comprehensible native English in the form of something that is very important to understand these
					days memes or like you guys say m okay today I'm going to look at some memes and we are going to
					talk about why they are funny okay so this is a good way to practice your English because you are
					going to learn vocabulary and you might just laugh okay so guys I want you to tell me down in the
					comments below after this video which one was your favorite all right guys here we go first meme
					right here when you open a snack and your girlfriend suddenly starts paying attention so maybe a
					couple of you guys don't know what snack means snack is food like potato chips or maybe some cookies
					it's not a meal it's not like a whole dinner it's something you eat when you're just a little bit
					hungry maybe popcorn while you're watching TV or a candy bar okay something little so as you can see
					with a little shark here he's like H I want that okay and okay guys if you have a girlfriend or a
					wife I think you can relate to this meme okay I remember when my wife and I were just dating there
					was one time in my house I was going to go make myself something to eat I was a little bit hungry so
					I wanted a snack I asked her hey are you hungry would you like something no no no thank so I go in
					the kitchen I make myself a sandwich okay it's a peanut butter sandwich because I love peanut butter
					sandwiches I don't eat them much but when I do I love them nothing but bread and peanut butter and a
					glass of milk that's my favorite snack anyway I made the perfect peanut butter sandwich I came back
					sat down on the couch she looked at me like the shark and she said H kis and I knew what she wanted
					she wanted a bite of my sandwich so then we shared my sandwich that I made for myself when she was
					not hungry okay that's why that's a good meme because girlfriends will steal your food it's what
					they do this is a good one too guys tomorrow I'm going to get up and work out at 6:00 a.m. okay we
					we all say that all right we're going to go to the gym early in the morning and it's says me at 9:00
					a.m. so as you can see by that lazy little guy he did not get up at 6:00 like he said he was okay I
					think uh you really got to build up discipline if you're going to try and go early in the morning to
					the gym okay and I think we've all been in the situation where our alarm goes off at 6:00 a.m. or
					5:00 a.m. and we hit snooze or we turn it off right so I think we can all relate to that guy he did
					not get up and he did not go work out oh this is a good one guys um in case you think that you are
					working under pressure okay so this means in case you think that at your job your boss wants a lot
					from you there's a lot of pressure your boss always says did you get it done yet you better do it
					right do a good job okay well this guy in the black coat is Kim Jong-un which is a dictator in North
					Korea and the point of this is that if his people don't do what he wants he will have them killed so
					imagine the pressure that the guy that's doing the little job on the computer is feeling okay he
					cannot mess up so next time you are at work and you think your boss is putting a lot of pressure on
					you think about this guy trying to work for Kim Jong-un okay guys here we go uh so aot shooting star
					is like you see a star in the sky and it goes okay you see it fly it could be a meteor it could be a
					just a a comet or an asteroid but it looks like that and we have a thing where if you see a shooting
					star you have to make a wish oh I wish I had a million dollars o I wish I would find somebody I
					truly love okay uh I think that might come from the movie Pinocchio I think that's where that came
					from cuz there was a song in there that said When You Wish Upon a Star so he says ooh cool a
					shooting star then he makes a wish I wish my salary raises would be higher than inflation so salary
					is the money that your job pays you and inflation is when prices for everything go up so a big
					problem that a lot of people are facing in a lot of different places some countries have already
					been destroyed by inflation but right now it's a trending topic here in the US because salaries what
					businesses are paying are not going up however the cost of food is going way up the cost of gas is
					up okay so he says I wish my job would pay me more and inflation would go down and then you could
					see the shooting star says nope can't help you there buddy sorry not going to happen and the joke of
					this meme is that the government is so stupid that that's a dumb wish and it can't be can't be made
					okay uh because they're going to keep on screwing up the economy and salaries will not raise higher
					than inflation but we can hope oh this is a good one too guys if you see the lady she's at the
					doctor's office doctor says hello why are you here today and me I say I don't want to go to work all
					right guys have you done this before be honest tell me tell me in the comments have you went to the
					doctor so that you did not have to go to work I'm going to be honest with you guys I have I have so
					I don't know how it is at your job but at my job and a lot of jobs if you call off you say hey boss
					I can't come in today I'm sick  yeah you've done it before I bet so the thing is you can't
					just call and say that or else you'll get in trouble at work you have to actually go to the doctor
					and get a note tell the doctor I need a note for work they'll write you a note that says so and so
					Kyle was in my care today he can go back to work tomorrow when you take that you say hey boss I was
					really sick yesterday but I'm good now okay you take it to your boss and you can't get in trouble so
					a lot of times when people want a day off they'll go to the doctor's office super early in the
					morning right when they open up get a note and then they get to enjoy the rest of the day I've done
					it once or twice guys okay this is a good one too this is from breaking bed and that guy is a
					psychopath he's a really bad guy but anyway it says my boss meeting with management super happy and
					then it says my boss meeting with direct reports okay so by management they mean the boss's boss
					okay so for example the manager meeting with the owner of the business okay his boss uh and by
					direct reports they meanes okay the workers the people who are under the manager so what they're
					trying to say here is that when the boss is around his boss he okay sucking up we call it sucking up
					oh you look good today sir looking good I like your haircut nice oh yeah how's the weather okay he's
					in super nice smoo kissing up or sucking up to the boss but when the boss goes away he's mean to the
					workers okay and a lot of managers have this problem where they think that they are higher up up
					than their workers so they treat them like they are less of a person and I don't like that at all if
					I ever have my own business that's making money and I have people working with me I want to treat
					them very well I want them to respect me so they will work hard uh my business will make money and I
					will be able to give them good money too so that's a win-win a lot of managers don't act that way
					but when their boss comes around Hey sir yeah everything's great here we're doing a good job right
					guys and then they want to pretend that they are your friend when the big boss is around I've seen
					this happen guys does your boss act like that when their boss is around okay this one's pretty funny
					too okay so here it says me selecting a profile picture and then it says a picture of me 10 years
					ago before I gave up okay so you see the guys M abdominal maros he's got a sixpack he's got big
					muscles so the joke here is a lot of times people who are a little older sometimes they pick a
					profile picture for their Facebook Instagram whatever their dating profile okay on a dating
					application but instead of just taking a a recent picture or photo act like this this you know hey
					this is what I look like today right click that's my photo no they go pick a picture from 10 years
					ago when they were hot all right when they were uh muscular when the women had real pretty hair and
					their skin looked nice okay and then you meet these people in real life and you're like you are not
					that person from the picture then they say oh no that's me yeah I've gained a little bit of weight
					or me a couple years ago I've seen this before guys oh this one's funny too we got Arnold
					Schwarzenegger here so that paint on his face is called camouflage and we put on camouflage when we
					want to blend in or disappear and not be seen okay so he says when I'm out and I see somebody from
					high school so he's saying the meme is saying that when I see somebody from high school I try and
					hide okay try and hide um and I don't know why we do this as humans why don't we just say oh hey
					buddy take care now so there have been a couple times where I've seen somebody and I just wave or
					shake their hand real quick and keep moving like oh hey cool man take care but sometimes you just
					don't feel like talking to people they were never really your friend so you kind of just look away
					and out of the the corner of your eye you can see that they look away too cuz they don't want to
					talk either okay so that one's pretty funny I think us who are a little bit older in our 30s who
					have been outside of school for a while we could probably uh probably relate to this one right guys
					right tell me it's not just me guys tell me I'm not just antisocial here's another good one modern
					supportive husband you've got the guy with his camera microphone and his headphones okay what does
					this mean guys if this is a supportive husband what's he doing he's taking his wife's Instagram
					pictures okay those of you guys who are married and your wife likes to take cute pictures for her
					Instagram you know what I mean I'm one more please oh no no no I don't like that one one more please
					one more okay my baby always wants one more but I do it like this guy cuz I'm a modern supportive
					husband but seriously guys she records me more than I record her her because she helps me with the
					channel so I'm happy to take pictures of my wife but this is just funny that you guys maybe have
					seen pictures of Instagram boyfriends where it's a guy on the ground trying to take a cute picture
					for his girlfriend yeah you've seen that uhoh this one guys I've been here when you're sleeping and
					your alarm did not ring ring ring ring yet but the amount of sleep you're getting is suspicious okay
					so sometimes we'll wake up and all of a sudden we feel really well rested and it feels like we've
					been sleeping for 10 hours and we're like my alarm didn't go off what's going on here guys like did
					I miss my alarm did I forget to set it last night so guys this sometimes happens to me because when
					I get up in the morning before work the sun is not up yet okay it's still dark outside so sometimes
					I'll wake up and I can see just a little bit of light through my window Ventana and I get super
					suspicious like wait a minute did I over sleep but sometimes it's a little bit lighter uh in the
					morning so that's what that is I never forget to set my alarm because I check it like two three
					times before I go to bed I obsess about it because I'm scared of this I don't ever want to oversleep
					cuz that's not a good feeling when then you have to rush to work you're late you have to tell them
					why so I try my best to be punctual and being punctual means that you try to be on time to things
					you don't want to be late oh guys this one's sad that's why they've got Michael Jordan crying in
					this meme when you wake up and check your phone to see how much time left to sleep but it's right
					before your alarm is supposed to ring guys this happens to me all the time usually I have my alarm
					set for 4:30 in the morning because I like to get up and go to the gym before I go to work so a lot
					of times I'll wake up and I'll look at my phone and it's like 4:27 or 4:2 I ain't even I've woke up
					and it was literally 1 minute before my alarm clock and I was like because everybody knows that the
					best feeling in the world is when you wake up you look at your phone and you still have two more
					hours oh krio guys krio you get to lay back down for two more hours that's the best I love it when I
					wake up and my phone says like 2:00 in the morning oh it's the best so good okay and here's the last
					one guys last one when you come back to work on Monday hey how was your 48 hour break so guys people
					don't say how was your 48 hour break they say hey how was your weekend but I never really thought
					about this until I looked at this meme a weekend is only 48 Hours okay we work all week just to have
					48 hours free that's sad so that's what they're trying to say here is that it kind of sucks that we
					work so much and then we only get 48 hours off and everybody's like oh how was your weekend like it
					was some sort of big vacation but it's really not all right guys those were the memes for today to
					help you guys to improve your English I proud of each and every one of you who has been on this
					journey with me okay it's my journey of helping sharing my language trying to grow this YouTube
					channel your guys' journey of acquiring a new language which in my opinion is one of the coolest
					most valuable things that we can do so thank you guys thank you for sharing in this journey with me
					this learning experience I promise you guys that even if you learn a lot from these videos I am
