				<p id="1cf468a0-53d4-81d8-8b24-f9852fdd6eeb" class="">No two projects are exactly the same, which means
					there are many different ways to manage them.<br />Each project comes with its own needs and factors
					that impact how you’ll take action and achieve your goals.<br />There are many ways to manage
					projects,
					and not always one right way to do so.<br />Picture this– your project managing a political campaign
					for
					a local candidate.<br />To make it happen, you need to think about things like your available
					resources,
					the people you’ll be working with, the election date, and the location.<br />You need to be aware of
					lots of details to successfully complete your project.<br />Because so many different things can
					impact
					a project, it’s important to understand its basic structure.<br />We call this structure the project
					lifecycle.<br />The lifecycle is a great way to guide your project in the right direction so that
					you
					and your project stay on track and end up in the right place.<br />Most project life cycles have
					four
					major phases, each with their own set of tasks and concerns.<br />Check it out.<br />The main phases
					of
					a project are initiate the project, make a plan, execute and complete tasks, and finally, close the
					project.<br />Let’s talk about the first phase, initiate the project.<br />This is the launch pad
					for
					the entire process of your project.<br />In this phase, you’ll define project goals and
					deliverables,
					identify the budget and resources you’ll need, the people involved in your project, and any other
					details that can impact the successful completion of your project.<br />You’ll document all this
					information in one place to showcase the project’s value and, hopefully, get approval to move
					forward
					with it.<br />Once the project is approved, it’s time to get rolling.<br />Next, you’ll make a plan
					for
					how you’ll meet the goals of your project.<br />There are all kinds of ways to plan your project,
					and
					we’ll get into some different methods and techniques later on.<br />But right now, the important
					thing
					to know is that, for every single project, creating a plan of how you’re going to meet your goals is
					absolutely 100% essential.<br />Think about it– you can’t hire a contractor to build a house without
					planning what it’ll look like or how much you have to spend.<br />These same considerations apply to
					any
					project that you manage.<br />To be effective, your plan needs to include a lot of things, for
					example,
					a budget, a breakdown of all the tasks that you need to be completed, ways to communicate team roles
					and
					responsibilities, a schedule, resources, and what to do in case your project encounters problems or
					needs to change, and that’s just to name a few.<br />Once you have your plan in place, it’s time to
					execute and complete those tasks.<br />It’s important to point out that your project team has the
					job of
					completing the project tasks.<br />Now, as the project manager, your role’s a little
					different.<br />While you might be in charge of completing certain tasks in the project, your
					primary
					tasks, as the project manager, are to monitor progress and keep your team motivated.<br />You’ll
					also
					remove any obstacles that might come up so that the tasks are executed well and on
					time.<br />Finally,
					when all the tasks have been completed, all the resources have been accounted for, and the project
					has
					crossed the finish line, it’s time to close the project.<br />Why is it important to
					close?<br />Well,
					one big reason is so your team has a moment to celebrate all of their hard work, but closing the
					project
					is also a chance to evaluate how the project went.<br />You can make note of what worked and what
					didn’t, so you can plan better for next time.<br />Even if the project was a massive success, it’s
					helpful to take time to reflect.<br />Closing the project is also a great way to connect with anyone
					outside your team who may have had interest in the project’s goal.<br />You can let everyone know
					what
					was completed and what you accomplished.<br />Some projects, like the campaign example, will have a
					firm
					end date.<br />Once the project is finished, that’s it.<br />There’s no more work to do.<br />Other
					projects have different finish lines.<br />For example, a project where you’re implementing a new
					ordering system at a restaurant is complete after the system is set up and the employees know how it
					works.<br />At that point, your goals are completed.<br />Now, it’s time to hand over the project to
					another group whose job it is to provide support and make sure the system stays running on a day to
					day
					basis.<br />Another example of this is, I once project managed the creation of a dashboard that
					would be
					used by various stakeholders in my organization.<br />This dashboard would show pertinent
					information to
					each stakeholder depending on the team that they were a part of in our broader organization.<br />I
					project managed the beginning, from writing out the vision for the project, to the end, where we
					deliver
					the dashboard.<br />Now, once I passed off the final product, I transitioned the continued update of
					each team’s data and the corresponding dashboard page to the respective teams.<br />Think of it like
					turning over the keys of a newly built house to its new owner.<br />The project of building the
					house is
					complete, and now, it’s up to the owner to take care of the house’s maintenance and the
					upkeep.<br />So
					there you have it– the project lifecycle.<br />The exact name for each phase might change depending
					on
					the type of project or organization you work for, but the general idea stays the same.<br />And
					following the project processes you will learn in this course will set you up for project management
					success.<br />Next, we’ll take a closer look into what happens during each phase of the traditional
					project lifecycle.<br />[MUSIC PLAYING] Now that we’ve discussed the project lifecycle, we’re going
					to
					explore some of the different tasks that match up with each life cycle phase.<br />But first, let’s
					review the phases.<br />The project lifecycle phases are initiate the project, make a plan, execute,
					and
					complete tasks, and close out the project.<br />Great.<br />Let’s get back to the task that need to
					be
					accomplished during each phase.<br />For this video, we’re going to focus on the first two project
					lifecycle phases, initiating the project and making a plan.<br />It’s important to call out that the
					name or tasks for each phase might change, or may be a little different depending on the type of
					project
					or the organization where you work.<br />At Google, we use a mix of different project management
					methods, which you’ll learn more about later in the course.<br />But regardless of the method, all
					projects share a lot of the same tasks needed to get the job done, so let’s get into it.<br />The
					first
					step of the project lifecycle is to initiate the project.<br />During initiation, you’ll organize
					all of
					the information you have available to you about your project.<br />This way, when you’re ready to
					continue on, you’ll be prepared for the next phase, when you can create your plan.<br />Defining
					project
					goals makes the details of your project clear so that you and your team can successfully complete
					the
					project.<br />For example, if the project goal is to manage a political campaign, then some
					deliverables, which are specific tasks or outcomes, might be to raise $5,000 or get 500 signatures
					in
					support of your candidate’s cause.<br />With this in mind, you’ll need to do some research to come
					up
					with ideas that will help you meet your goals.<br />You’ll also need to find out what resources are
					available.<br />Resources can include people, equipment, software programs, vendors, physical space
					or
					locations, and more.<br />Anything you need to actually complete the project is considered a
					resource.<br />Now, as the project manager, you’ll record all of these details in your project
					proposal
					and then get them approved by a decision maker or group of decision makers at your company so that
					you
					can move ahead with your project plans.<br />Now, in some cases, you may be the decision maker, so
					be
					sure to consider the same set of factors when initiating your project before moving to the next
					stage.<br />No worries– you will learn all the details about how to create a project
					proposal.<br />We
					will be getting into more detail of what this is and how to create one later in the
					course.<br />Voila,
					once your project is approved, you’ll move into the second step of the project lifecycle, which is
					to
					make a plan.<br />In this phase, you’ll create a budget and set the project schedule.<br />You’ll
					establish the project team and determine each person’s roles and responsibilities.<br />Let’s pause
					for
					a second.<br />You may be thinking, ugh, why can’t we just get started?<br />But that’s the thing
					with
					project management.<br />Delivery planning is critical to a project success.<br />A crucial part of
					project management is planning for risk and change.<br />An experienced project manager knows that
					plans
					always change.<br />This ability to adapt is all about thinking and planning ahead.<br />Scheduling
					delays, budget changes, technology and software requirements, legal issues, quality control, and
					access
					to resources are just some of the more common types of risks and changes that a project manager
					needs to
					consider.<br />So it’s important to keep in mind that planning is key to reducing those
					risks.<br />But
					don’t worry, if the idea of risk seems a little overwhelming right now, in later courses, we’ll
					teach
					you all about understanding risks.<br />Just know that it’s really important not to skip this step,
					and
					to always make a plan.<br />Again, the success of your project depends on it.<br />Once you have a
					plan,
					you’ll communicate all of this information to your team.<br />That way, each member will know which
					tasks they’ll own and what to do if they have questions, or if they run into problems.<br />You’ll
					also
					communicate your plan with others who have an interest in the project success, so that they are
					aware of
					your plans and your progress as the project continues to move forward.<br /><br /></p>
				<p id="1cf468a0-53d4-80f1-8e3e-da807a17085e" class="">We just learned about the core tasks that need to
					be
					completed and the first two phases of the project lifecycle, initiating the project and making
					plans.<br />Now, it’s time to put your plans into action.<br />Remember, it’s not your job to
					actually
					do all the tasks.<br />Your primary job as the project manager is to manage the progress of the
					project
					as a whole.<br />This means you’ll oversee your team’s efforts and make sure everyone understands
					what’s
					expected of them, what tasks need to be done, and how and when to complete those tasks.<br />It’s
					also
					your job to help remove any obstacles and to alert the right people if it looks like there might be
					a
					delay to the project.<br />This means you’ll need to communicate with your team and anyone else
					involved
					in your project through meetings, written communications like memos, emails or internal chat tools,
					and
					other working documents like task reports.<br />Quick pro tip– if in doubt, err on the side of over
					communication.<br />As your project progresses, you’ll make adjustments to the schedule, budget, and
					allocation of resources, clearly communicating updates all along the way.<br />When all the tasks
					are
					complete, and you’ve met the project goal, it’s time to close the project.<br />This phase is
					usually
					overlooked because it’s easy to assume that, once the project goal has been delivered, everyone can
					move
					on, but hold up.<br />There’s still a lot that needs to be done.<br />First, check to make sure all
					tasks have been completed, including any work that was added along the way.<br />Be sure any
					outstanding
					invoices have been paid, resources are returned and accounted for, and project documentation has
					been
					submitted.<br />Next, and this is very important, get confirmation that the final outcome of your
					project is acceptable to the people you’re delivering it to.<br />It is crucial to your project’s
					success that the person who asked you to manage the project is satisfied with the end
					result.<br />Once
					your project has been accepted as meeting its goals, take some time to reflect on what went well and
					maybe what didn’t go so well.<br />This reflection is usually called a retrospective, and it’s a
					chance
					to note best practices and learn how to manage a project more effectively next time.<br />Even if
					everything went great, the notes from your retrospective are also valuable to the people or
					organization
					receiving the end result of the project.<br />That’s because they can use that information to inform
					decisions about their business the next time they consider a project.<br />Now, it’s time to collect
					all
					the project documentation that you’ve created or collected along the way, including all of your
					plans
					and reflections, and share the final results of your project with your stakeholders.<br />Remember,
					stakeholders are people who are interested in and affected by the project’s completion and
					success.<br />Depending on the type of project, stakeholders could include a department or
					organization’s management team, clients or customers of your product or service, users of your new
					tool
					or process, or even the community at large, if you’re planning a community town hall
					meeting.<br />Pro
					tip– stakeholders play a huge role in the development and success of your project.<br />You’ll learn
					a
					lot more about these key players later on, but for now, just know that they are like the VIPs of
					your
					project.<br />Next, take some time to celebrate the effort your team invested in the
					project.<br />The
					celebrations help people feel good about the work they’ve done and think of the work as uplifting
					and
					rewarding because it truly is.<br />Some ideas for small celebrations are a company or team wide
					email
					thanking the team and acknowledging individual efforts.<br />Now, for big projects, you may even
					consider a company party to celebrate the team and the project success.<br />To wrap up, you and
					your
					team can formally move on from the project, so that you can pursue new projects in the
					future.<br />Well, as you can see, being a project manager is a lot of work, but it’s very
					rewarding.<br />And it’s all, well, manageable when you follow through with the project
					lifecycle.<br />You can see how the organization, communication, and improvements you add to various
					areas of a project can make the entire team more effective and efficient, and you can have an impact
					on
					many areas of a project in a way that’s greater than if you focused on any one task on the
					project.<br />Similar to a coach with a sports team, even though you aren’t actually playing a
					direct
					role in the game, your guidance, your communication, and your team building can make the difference
					in a
					happy high performing and successful team.<br /><br /></p>
				<p id="1cf468a0-53d4-8095-b75e-e17b474bddfe" class=""> Different types of projects will benefit from
					applying different project management approaches or methodologies.<br />A project management
					methodology
					is a set of guiding principles and processes for owning a project through its
					lifecycle.<br />Project
					management methodologies help guide project managers throughout a project with steps to take, tasks
					to
					complete, and principles for managing the project overall.<br />We will talk through two different
					types, linear and iterative.<br />Linear means the previous phase or task has to be completed before
					the
					next can start.<br />A linear approach would work well for a project like building a
					house.<br />You’d
					need the blueprint created before you can begin laying the foundation.<br />You’ve got to know
					exactly
					what the house will look like, its dimensions, and what type and how many resources you’ll
					need.<br />Then you’ve got to finish the foundation before you put up the walls, and the walls
					before
					you put up the roof, and so on before you have the finished project, which is a bungalow style
					home.<br />There’s also a clear goal.<br />You know exactly what the house will look like.<br />It’s
					unlikely that, in the middle of building the house, your client is going to decide they’d rather
					have a
					multi-level Victorian instead of a single level bungalow.<br />What’s more, even if they wanted the
					change, it’s too late.<br />You already laid the foundation and built the walls for the
					bungalow.<br />Done and done.<br />A bungalow is what they wanted, and a bungalow is what they’ll
					get.<br />Using this type of linear project management approach, completing each step in order and
					sticking to the agreed upon specific results in being able to deliver just what the client
					ordered.<br />For a project like producing a new show for a television company, on the other hand,
					it
					might be more effective to use a methodology that uses an iterative, more flexible approach, where
					some
					of the phases and tasks will overlap or happen at the same time that other tasks are being worked
					on.<br />Your team comes up with an idea for a show and films a pilot.<br />You run several tests of
					the
					pilot in different locations and time slots.<br />As your team gathers feedback about the pilot,
					adjustments to the show are made.<br />At the same time, you’re able to make decisions and start
					working
					on other parts of the project, like hiring permanent actors, starting film production, and working
					on
					advertising even while the final version of the show is being worked on.<br />And even though the
					overall goal is clear, produce a new show, the type of show could end up being different from the
					original idea.<br />Your team may have started out creating a one hour show, but during testing,
					they
					realized a half hour show would actually be more popular.<br />Or maybe a supporting choose to go to
					of
					positive feedback, so you want to make them one of the main characters.<br />What’s more important
					is
					that you produce a show that audiences are going to watch.<br />Because of the iterative approach,
					plans
					remain flexible, and you’re able to make adjustments as you go along.<br />Each of these projects
					benefits from a different approach to how tasks will be carried out in order to best meet the
					project’s
					goals.<br />Linear projects don’t require many changes during development and have a clear
					sequential
					process.<br />If you stick to the plan, it’s likely you’ll finish your tasks within the time
					schedule
					and all other criteria.<br />Iterative projects allow for more flexibility and anticipate
					changes.<br />You’re able to test out parts of the project to make sure they work before the final
					result is delivered, and you can deliver parts of the project as they are completed rather than
					waiting
					for the entire project to be done.<br />Over the years, the field of project management has
					developed
					many different methods that project managers can choose from that will help them manage most
					effectively.<br />Google takes a hybrid approach to project management.<br />We mix and match from
					different methods depending on the type of project.<br />Our project managers are encouraged to
					adapt
					their own style to what makes the most sense to their project and their team.<br />So you’re
					starting to
					see how different approaches might benefit the projects you’ll be working on now.<br />Pretty soon,
					you’ll become a pro at picking an approach or combining approaches to fit with your project.<br />Up
					next, we’ll learn about the most well known and most used project management methods that you can
					add to
					your project management toolbox.<br /><br /></p>
				<p id="1cf468a0-53d4-802c-9ddb-e2e355a62902" class="">Two of the most popular project management
					methodologies are waterfall and agile.<br />Each of these methods has a rich and complex
					history.<br />In fact, you could take an entire certificate on just one of these methods
					alone.<br />You’ll have a chance to learn more about waterfall and agile methods in the upcoming
					courses
					of this certificate, so be sure to check those out after completing this one to learn more.<br />For
					now, I’ll just give you a brief introduction and provide you with some examples that illustrate how
					different types of projects can be more successful or easier to manage when you consider which
					method to
					use.<br />First, let’s take a look at the waterfall approach.<br />Waterfall, as a methodology, was
					created in the ’70s and refers to the sequential ordering of phases.<br />You complete one at a time
					down the line, like a waterfall starting at the top of a mountain and traveling to the
					bottom.<br />Remember the definition an example of linear from that last video?<br />Well, waterfall
					has
					a linear approach.<br />At first, waterfall was used in the physical engineering disciplines, like
					manufacturing and construction.<br />Then software emerged as an important field of engineering, and
					waterfall was applied to those kinds of projects as well.<br />It’s still used a lot in engineering
					fields, including product feature design and application, also known as app design.<br />Over time,
					other industries, like event planning and retail, have adapted waterfall phases to fit their
					projects.<br />There are now many styles of waterfall, and each style has its own specific set of
					steps.<br />What they all have in common, though, is that they follow an ordered set of steps that
					are
					directly linked to clearly defined expectations, resources, and goals that are not likely to
					change.<br />Let’s take a closer look.<br />The phases of a waterfall project lifecycle follow the
					same
					standard project lifecycle flow that you learned about earlier– initiating, planning, executing,
					which
					includes managing and completing tasks, and closing.<br />So when would you want to use a waterfall
					approach to project management?<br />Well, when the phases of the project are clearly defined, or
					when
					there are tasks to complete before another can begin, or when changes to the project are very
					expensive
					to implement once it’s started.<br />For example, if you were catering an event for a client on a
					very
					tight budget, you might want to use waterfall methodology.<br />This way, you could confirm the
					number
					of guests first, then very clearly define the menu, get approval and agreement on the menu items and
					costs, order the unreturnable ingredients, and successfully feed the guests.<br />Because the budget
					is
					limited, you can’t afford to make changes or waste food.<br />The traditional method won’t allow for
					the
					client to make changes to the menu once the order has been placed.<br />You can also reserve tables,
					chairs, and dishes because exactly how much and what kind of food is being prepared.<br />A well
					thought
					out traditional approach to managing a project can help you reach your desired outcome with as
					little
					pain as possible during the project implementation.<br />By spending extra effort thinking through
					the
					entire project up front, you’ll set yourself up for success.<br />Now, in an ideal world, following
					this
					approach will help you identify the right people and tasks, plan accordingly to avoid any hiccups
					along
					the way, create room for documenting your plans and progress, and enable you to hit that
					goal.<br />However, plans don’t always go well according to plan.<br />In fact, they rarely
					do.<br />The
					waterfall method has some risk management practices to help avoid and deal with project
					changes.<br />Luckily, there are other methodologies that are entirely built for change and
					flexibility.<br />One of these is agile, another popular project management approach.<br />The term
					agile means being able to move quickly and easily.<br />It also refers to flexibility, which means
					being
					willing and able to change and adapt.<br />Projects that use an agile approach often have many tasks
					being worked on at the same time or in various stages of completion, which makes it an iterative
					approach.<br />The concepts that shaped agile methodology began to emerge in the ’90s as a response
					to
					the growing demand for faster delivery of products, mainly software applications at that time, but
					it
					wasn’t officially named agile until 2001.<br />The phases of an agile project also follow the
					project
					lifecycle stages we described earlier generally speaking.<br />However, rather than having to always
					go
					in order or wait for one phase to end before starting the next, agile project phases overlap, and
					tasks
					are completed in iterations, which, in scrum, are called sprints.<br />Scrum is a form of agile that
					you’ll learn more about in the course focused entirely on agile, and by sprint, we do not mean
					running a
					race as fast as possible.<br />In this case, sprints are short chunks of time, usually one to four
					weeks, where a team works together to focus on completing specific tasks.<br />What’s important to
					understand is that agile is more of a mindset than just a series of steps or phases.<br />It’s
					concerned
					with building an effective, collaborative team that seeks regular feedback from the client, so that
					they
					can deliver the best value as quickly as possible and adjust as changes emerge.<br />Projects that
					are
					best suited for an agile approach are those where the client has an idea of what they want, but
					doesn’t
					have a concrete picture in mind.<br />Or they have a set of qualities they’d like to see in the end
					result, but aren’t as concerned with exactly what it looks like.<br />Another indicator that a
					project
					may benefit from agile is the level of high uncertainty and risk involved with the
					project.<br />We’ll
					talk more about those things later.<br />An example of a project that would work well with an agile
					approach might be building a website.<br />Your team would build the different parts of the website
					in
					sprints and deliver each part to the client as they are built. This way, the website can be launched
					with some parts, say the main homepage, that are complete and ready for public view, while other
					parts,
					maybe the company blog or the ability to book online appointments, continue to get built out over
					time.<br />This allows the team to get feedback early on about what works and what doesn’t, make
					adjustments along the way, and reduce wasted efforts.<br />In this same website example, the
					waterfall
					method will plan for and require the whole website to be complete before it can launch.<br />Having
					a
					basic understanding of waterfall and agile will help you figure out an effective way to organize and
					plan out your project, and knowing about these two methodologies will come in handy during future
					job
					interviews because you’ll be able to demonstrate a solid understanding of the project management
					landscape.<br />Waterfall and agile are two of the more common and well known project management
					methodologies, but they are by no means the only or the best ones.<br /><br /></p>
				<p id="1cf468a0-53d4-809a-9a71-da181d3f7fa0" class=""> Lean Six Sigma is one more you can add.<br />It’s
					a
					combination of two parent methodologies, Lean and Six Sigma.<br />The uses for Lean Six Sigma are
					common
					in projects that have goals to save money, improve quality, and move through processes
					quickly.<br />It
					also focuses on team collaboration, which promotes a positive work environment.<br />The idea is
					that,
					when your team feels valued, motivation and productivity increases, and the whole process functions
					more
					smoothly.<br />There are five phases in the Lean Six Sigma approach.<br />They are define, measure,
					analyze, improve, and control, commonly known as DMAIC.<br />DMAIC is a strategy for process
					improvement, meaning you’re trying to figure out where the problems are in the current process and
					fix
					them so that everything runs more smoothly.<br />The goal of each step is to ensure the best
					possible
					results for your project.<br />Just like with waterfall and agile, there are more specific details
					for
					using DMAIC and the Lean Six Sigma approach, but what’s great about the DMAIC process is that it can
					be
					used to solve any business problem.<br />Let’s break it down.<br />The first phase is to define the
					project goal and what it will take to meet it.<br />This first phase is very similar to the
					initiation
					phase of traditional project management.<br />Let’s take a real scenario to illustrate.<br />Imagine
					that you are brought on as a project manager for a large travel company to help streamline and
					minimize
					customer service wait times that have been surging due to a recent sales promotion.<br />Before you
					begin working on tackling the issue, you’re going to need to define the project goal and talk to
					stakeholders about expectations for the project.<br />In this case, the goal is to take average wait
					times down to less than 10 minutes on average compared to 30 minutes.<br />Next, it’s time to
					measure
					how the current process is performing.<br />In order to improve processes, DMAIC focuses on
					data.<br />Here, you want to map out the current process and locate exactly where the problems are
					and
					what kind of effect the problems have on the process.<br />Using our example, you’re trying to
					figure
					out why it’s taking so long for the travel company to address a customer service issue.<br />To do
					this,
					you look at company data, like average wait times, number of customers per day, and seasonal
					variations.<br />Then you’ll set a plan for how you’ll get that data and how often to measure
					it.<br />This could look something like having the company generate reports on a weekly, monthly,
					quarterly basis.<br />In other situations, you might have employees or customers fill out surveys or
					look at inventory shipping and tracking records, things like that.<br />Once you have the data and
					measurements you can move on to the next phase, which is analyze.<br />Here, you’ll begin to
					identify
					gaps and issues.<br />In our example, after mapping out the process and data points, you may see
					that
					staffing is inadequate on days where customers are the highest.<br />Data analysis is important for
					project managers regardless of which method you choose, and we will learn more about that in an
					upcoming
					course.<br />From your data, you’ll have a strong understanding of causes and solutions to get to
					the
					next stage, improve.<br />Oftentimes, project managers may want to leap straight to this phase, but
					really projects and process improvements should only be made after a careful analysis.<br />This is
					the
					point where you present your findings and get ready to start making improvements.<br />In our
					example,
					this could be modifying staffing to address customer needs.<br />The last step of this cycle is
					control.<br />You’ve gotten the process and project to a good place, and now it’s time to implement
					it
					and keep it there.<br />Controlling is all about learning from the work you did up front to put new
					processes and documentation in place and continue to monitor so the company doesn’t revert back to
					the
					old, inefficient way of doing things.<br />To sum it all up, you can remember DMAIC like
					this.<br />Defining tells you what to measure.<br />Measuring tells you what to
					analyze.<br />Analyzing
					tells you what to improve, and improving tells you what to control.<br />Lean Six Sigma and the
					DMAIC
					approach are ideal when the project goal includes improving a current process to fix complex or high
					risk problems, like improving sales conversions or eliminating a bottleneck, which is when things
					get
					backed up during a process.<br />Following the DMAIC process prevents the likelihood of skipping
					important steps and increases the chances of a successful project, and is a way for your team to
					discover best practices that your client can use going forward.<br />It uses data and focuses on the
					customer or end user to solve problems in a way that builds on previous learning so that you can
					discover effective, permanent solutions for difficult problems.<br />There are many ways out there
					that
					break the flow of project management into digestible phases and approaches, all with the same end
					goal
					of accomplishing the desired outcome as smoothly as possible and delivering the best
					value.<br />Like I
					said earlier, at Google, we follow a lot of different approaches.<br />For instance, an engineering
					team
					releasing a customer focused product may primarily use agile when creating the product, but decide
					to
					plug in some of the aspects of waterfall project management for planning and documentation.<br />A
					customer service team might focus on using Lean Six Sigma to improve an experience for our users,
					like
					offering new features based on a recent analysis, but the team might develop parts of the code and
					roll
					out the features using agile iterations and sprints to allow for change.<br />Or one of our internal
					education and training teams may focus solely on waterfall project management to achieve a targeted
					goal
					of having all employees complete and annual compliance training.<br />Here, waterfall makes sense
					since
					the requirements of the training program are fixed, and so is the deadline and goal.<br />The
					biggest
					takeaway is to know the various methods and tools to be able to confidently apply what works best
					for
					you, your team, and the end goal.<br />There is no real prescription for how to execute a project
					perfectly because there are always pieces you can’t 100% control.<br />But the good news is, you can
					get
					pretty close with the skill sets you develop through learning about these different
					frameworks.<br />
