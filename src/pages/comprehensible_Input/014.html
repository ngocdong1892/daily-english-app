					Are you ready to learn some real life English with comprehensible input? Well, good, because today
					we are going to prepare a delicious feast from the country of Turkey, and we're going to do it on
					the grill. Let's go. All right, guys. Today we are going to make a Turkish feast. My wife and I, my
					little camera wife and I are going to eat. So good. So, we're going to make flatbread.<br>
					We're going to make hummus. We're going to make something called jujuk, I think is how it's
					pronounced. And the main dish is going to be kebabs. We're going to serve it with a Turkish yellow
					rice.<br>
					I'm going to make all kinds of stuff, guys. And we're also going to learn some interesting things
					about the country of Turkey along the way. So, let's start by making the dough for the flatbread.
					Okay. So, wife, what's the first thing I should do if I'm going to be mixing dough with my hands?
					You need to wash your hands. Need to wash my hands. Smart boy. So, wash my hands because I'm going
					to be mixing the dough with my hands.<br>
					All right, guys. There's a million different ways to make dough. I'm going to make it quick and
					simple with only two ingredients. Wife, what ingredients are they going to be? Flour and water.
					Flour and salt. And what? Flour and yogurt. Guys, this I'm not sure if they actually do this in
					Turkey, but this is a way that I like to make dough and it makes incredible pizza crust. I know that
					for sure. I've made pizza with it and I saw online that you can make these flatbreads with it and
					it's super fast.<br>
					So, that's what we're going to do today.
					So, have flour, 1 and 1/2 cups of flour.
					Okay, 1 and 1/2 cups of flour. Now, we need one cup yogurt. Now, we have our yogurt, we have our
					flour. We're going to put a little bit salt in for flavor.<br>
					Exactly that much. 10 shakes. 10 shakes. And guys, I'm going to do something else just to make it
					look cool. Because like I said last time you guys saw me cook, how it looks is very important for
					how it tastes. So guys, I got something very cool today. This is called a cleaver. I've always
					wanted one, but I never had it. Today I saw it at the store. So, how about it? This is called
					parsley. We're going to take just a little bit of parsley. Oh, yeah. This cleaver is awesome. Okay,
					parsley in.<br>
					Now, we mix. Just slowly start bringing it all together. Keep on mixing. And eventually, this is
					going to turn into a ball of dough like this. Like this. All right, guys. So, when you have your
					ball of dough like this, you have to do something called kneading it. Okay.<br>
					Kneading it means you keep folding it over like that. You fold it over. That's kneading bread or
					dough. And it helps with the texture of the dough to make better bread. So, here's our dough for our
					flatbreads. We're going to put that over here in this bowl and let it rest for about 20 minutes
					while I get everything else ready. All right. All right, guys. This is a pot and this is what we're
					going to use to cook our rice. So, we've got our pot. Got some butter here. Going to put a little
					bit of butter into our pot. This is going to give the rice a good flavor. In this bowl, I've got our
					rice, which I already rinsed. Put the rice into our pot. This is going to be a super simple rice,
					guys. We're just going to put a little bit of salt, some turmeric, which is going to give it that
					color.<br>
					Secret ingredient, which is going to give it a beautiful flavor, but also some extra protein, some
					chicken bone broth. This is made by boiling. You guys know what boiling is if you watch my videos.
					They boil chickens in water and you get bone broth. It's very healthy for you. It has protein and
					it's delicious. So many things to make, guys.<br>
					All right, wife. What do we do to the rice now?
					Let it cook. Just let it cook. My wife doesn't like me picking on her. I have to give her a little
					kiss.<br>
					Okay. Now, all right. Let's Let's make our jutchuk. Guys from Turkey, please tell me, am I
					pronouncing this correctly? Is it jutchuk? Because if I was reading it, I would say kakik or kasik,
					but I heard it on a video, somebody said juk. So, tell me, am I saying it right? Okay, guys, more
					yogurt. You guys eat a lot of yogurt over there in Turkey, don't you? That's cool because yogurt is
					very healthy, full of protein and probiotics.<br>
					Probiotics are actually little tiny living organisms and when you eat them they go down into your
					stomach and they help to digest the food but it is an essential part of a healthy gut. Gut is
					another word that we call stomach. Okay wife, what's this? Cucumber. Cucumber.
					Cucumber. This is organic cucumber because I want my wife to be healthy. I buy her organic. Thank
					you.<br>
					very much. All right, guys. We need that much with my cleaver. We're just going to chop this nice
					and thin. This knife is awesome and dangerous. Not for me because I'm a messa. No, we need these
					nice and small.<br>
					Okay, I don't think we want a whole lot of cucumber. So, I'm going to stir it up a little bit and
					see how that looks. I want a lot of cucumber. Baby wants a lot of cucumber. Okay, wife gets what she
					wants. That's going to be fresh and delicious. How does my jutch look, baby?<br>
					Great. Looks delicious. Okay, now the secret ingredient. Mint. Smells so good, guys. Wow. Okay. A
					little bit of mint in there. This is going to be so fresh. All right. The last ingredients to the
					jetik. Little bit of salt. And it's optional, which means you can do it if you want to, but you do
					not have to.<br>
					Little bit of garlic. Guys, I baked some garlic. I baked it in the oven because roasted garlic,
					which is what you call this, is delicious. So, we've got this roasted garlic and it's super soft,
					super very flavorful.<br>
					I love garlic and that's going to add a ton of flavor. That's my chic. Want to try? Mhm.
					It's good, guys. Now, we're going to put this in the fridge while we get everything else ready. All
					right, guys.<br>
					Everything's going great, but we have one problem. And we've got a little bit of extra vegetables.
					Baby, what do we do with our extra vegetables in this house?<br>
					Who do we give it to? Wins. We give it to Gwen. Connor, bring in the guinea.
					Presenting the most dangerous creature in this universe. Don't be fooled by her. This is my son
					Connor and our guinea pig, Gwen. Don't be fooled by her innocence. She's an evil mastermind to take
					over the world. Gwen loves vegetables. Yes, she's a veggie loving maniac. All right, guys. Next
					thing we're going to make hummus. We say hummus. If you hear a person from the US asking for this,
					they're going to say hummus. But my Muslim friend from Lebanon, Muhammad, told me that they say it
					hummus. So, we're going to make some hummus. Okay. So, chickpeas. bought some good olive oil for
					today because in Turkish cooking or any middle eastern cooking, you have to have good olive oil.
					Come on. What are the cheap My wife is just eating all my chickpeas. Okay, good olive oil. About
					that much for now.<br>
					We'll add some more roasted garlic because it's delicious. So, and we need some lemon juice. Don't
					get the juice in your eyes, guys. Don't get the juice in your eyes like I just did. That doesn't
					feel good. This is called squeezing a lemon. To squeeze. To squeeze. A lot of recipes will tell you
					to squeeze a lemon or a lime. And we'll see how that tastes. And I can add more if I need to.
					All right. I'm going to try and use this. This is called an immersion blender. See if that'll make
					it a little bit faster.<br>
					Oh yeah, that's much better.
					Need a little bit more lemon. Little bit more olive oil.
					Our hummus is looking good. All right, guys. Just to make it look a little better, I'm going to take
					our hummus and put it in this little bowl because it's all about presentation.<br>
					Yes. Spoon. My wife says, "Give me the spoon." Here, baby. Try that. M.
					All right, guys. So, camera wife likes it. Now, this is an ingredient I didn't even know what it
					was. I searched for it and found it for you guys in order to make the kebabs, but also a lot of
					people put it on their hummus. It's called sumac. All right, guys. Now, just to make our hummus look
					good, we're going to sprinkle a little bit of sumac on there. Kind of light. Mhm. And then I saved a
					couple of chickpeas whole dad.<br>
					Just for color and decoration, little bit parsley. That's my hummus. What do you think, wife? Look
					good. Okay. Now, traditionally they eat this at room temperature, but here in the United States,
					people usually eat it cold. How would you rather try it traditionally or in the refrigerator? I
					think I don't know. We're going to do it traditionally to respect our Turkish friends. All right.
					Now, the star of the show. Time to make some kebabs. All right, guys.<br>
					So, I guess for this recipe, you could use beef or lamb or any kind of meat you really want, but
					lamb is the most traditional and we're trying to be respectful to the tradition. So, we got ground
					lamb.<br>
					What sound does a lamb make, wife?
					Oh, yum.
					Don't do that. Oh, and okay, guys. Also, it is ho. So, don't worry, guys.<br>
					Kiss. You know what hel is? Maybe. No.
					Hel is something that's very important for people who practice the religion of Islam, Muslims. It's
					the way that the animal is killed. Okay? It means all the blood is drained from the animal and it is
					therefore clean and they're able to eat it according to their religious standard. I agree with that.
					We are eating ho today, guys. I like that. And Jewish people have something similar, but they call
					it kosher. Our seasonings here, we've got smoked paprika, which is a pepper cooked over fire. Sumac.
					I don't know what that is. Tell me what it is, guys. Salt, black pepper, and and cumin. That's going
					in.<br>
					This is going to be very flavorful.
					And guys, those of you guys in the Middle East, Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, the Middle Eastern
					countries, I love the way you guys cook. I'm I'm starting to learn more about your dishes, and I
					absolutely love all the different flavors that you guys use in cooking. So, I'm going to learn more
					and more about it and keep on trying new dishes. All right, guys. Onion.<br>
					These big peppers, guys, we call bell peppers. That is a bell. So, I guess these are kind of shaped
					like that. I don't know. All right, guys. Now, all the recipes I saw say to put these in a food
					processor. A food processor is something that you put the food in and it's But I don't have a food
					processor and I just bought this awesome knife. So, I am about to process this the oldfashioned way,
					just like this. Should look like that, guys. But you see how there's all kinds of water in there?
					Mhm. We got to get that liquid out because that will make the kebabs fall apart when we're grilling
					it. So, guys, this is paper towel. Paper towel. Put our pepper and onion mix on here. And we're
					going to do the same thing that we did to the lemon.<br>
					What verb did we do to the lemon?
					Squeeze. Squeeze. That's exactly what we want, guys. Let's get rid of that water.
					All right, guys. Most of the water's out. We put it in a bigger bowl. Put our mix in here. And we're
					also going to add a little bit of parsley to the meat just for color and some extra flavor.
					And some more garlic cuz garlic makes everything better. What is the one thing that garlic does not
					make better? Wife.<br>
					Kisses.
					Get it. Right. Right. Yeah. That's it.
					All right, guys. This is my grill. You guys have seen me cook in the kitchen.
					You haven't seen me cook on the grill yet. Today, we're going to do our kebabs on the grill. But
					first, I want to give you guys something a little bit extra in this video. So, I want to help you
					guys out with something that a subscriber from Iraq asked me in an email. So, they said, "Sometimes
					you say things that are very native, like putting two words together and they sound different. Could
					you explain that in a video?" Yeah, I can. With pleasure. So guys, what the subscriber was referring
					to is it's called a reduction, but it's when we take two words and smash them together.
					Okay? For example, going to becomes going to going to. So instead of saying I am going to do my
					homework later, a native would say I'm going to do my homework later. Want to becomes wanna.
					So, I might ask a friend of mine, "Do you want to go get some lunch with me?" Have to becomes have
					to. So, you might say, "Hey, Kyle, do you want to go fishing with me tomorrow?" And I will not say
					no because I have to work. I'll say, "No, I have to work tomorrow. I have to have to work." And
					guys, the last one of these useful tips for today, used to becomes used to. An example is I used to
					go fishing with my friend Ernie all the time. Guys, if you like these tips, tell me and I'll make
					this a regular section in the videos. I can help you guys out with little pieces of information like
					this to have you speaking like a native in no time. All right, let's get back to the Turkish ke.
					This is a lighter. A lighter. This is my grill. This is charcoal. So, we pour charcoal grill.
					stack it up to stack. Stack it up. Make like a little mountain and then you light it with your
					lighter. Now, this charcoal, guys, is called instant light because it already has a fluid on it that
					is flammable.<br>
					So, all you have to do is take a lighter and light it. All right, guys. While this is getting ready,
					we're going to go in and make the bread real quick. Hurry up, wife. Come on. Come on. Okay, guys.
					This new oven we got for this house is awesome. has this thing right here. And this is where we're
					going to cook the flatbreads. This you could call like a a flat top, maybe. Here, we're going to get
					the breads ready. I'm going to put a little bit of flour on my cutting board.
					This is a cutting board. Trying to do this nice and fast. This guys, it's called a rolling pin and
					use it to roll to roll out the All right, got our flatbreads rolled out. Let's put them on here to
					start cooking. All right, guys.<br>
					This is called a skewer. And we're making our kebabs. Take some meat, wrap it around the skewer. All
					right, guys.
					Our flatbreads are done.
					I'm going to put them in the oven at a very low temperature just to keep them warm until we're done
					with our kebabs.
					Here we've got our kebabs.
					And you put the meat on the skewer.<br>
					Now, in Turkey, they have different kinds of skewers that are much bigger.
					So, I'm scared that the meat's going to fall off of these, but we're going to try our best. So, I'll
					see you guys at the grill.<br>
					Okay, guys. Because my skewers are not the right kind, I'm scared they'll fall apart. So, I put down
					a piece of foil and we'll try and start them on that.<br>
					Then we have one that's going to be a patty. A patty is what we call the thing that is on a
					hamburger.<br>
					See what happens, guys. Let's close this so it gets some smoke and heat. And I'll show you guys what
					it looks like in a few.<br>
					[Music] All right, guys. So far, looking pretty good. I think we're going to be all right. Now,
					let's start learning a little bit about Turkey. One interesting fact that I found about Turkey is
					the first coin in the whole world is made in Turkey. This is a coin, guys. We call a coin, the money
					that is made out of steel, these little round things, we call them coins. Okay? This is a quarter.
					25 cents here in the US. That's the first American president, George Washington.<br>
					But way, way, way before George Washington existed, they already were making coins in Turkey.
					Another important piece of vocabulary when you're grilling, when we cook on the grill, we call that
					grilling, tongs. These are a griller's best friend. Okay. And right now I'm going to try and turn
					over my kebabs without them falling apart. Let's see another interesting fact about Turkey that I
					want my Turkish friends to tell me about. Okay, so Turkey is a majority Muslim country.<br>
					Okay, most of the people in Turkey are Muslim. They practice the religion of Islam. However, the
					national beverage of Turkey is alcoholic. In English, it's called lion's milk. Okay. Now, I thought
					that in Islam, alcohol was strictly prohibited, meaning that a Muslim cannot drink. So tell me my
					Turkish friends, is this the drink in Turkey that only people who are not Muslim drink or do the
					Muslims in Turkey drink alcohol occasionally as well? I'm interested to know. Please tell me, guys.
					All right, guys. So, my plan worked. Putting the foil down, cook them enough to make them stay
					together. Now, I have them over the fire, the open flame. And another interesting fact about Turkey
					is that there is a dessert in Turkey. Dessert is the sweet food that people like to eat after they
					eat something like this. And this dessert has chicken in it. My wife just made a face like what?
					That is so weird for us to hear, but this is a pudding. A chicken pudding, and it has chicken, milk,
					sugar, and cinnamon. Sounds strange, but if I was in Turkey, I would sure try it.
					Guys, I've worked hard for this meal.<br>
					I'm excited. Our kebabs are done.
					Flatbread, jik, hummus, and our yellow rice. And this is how I'm going to do it. Take my flatbread,
					take my kebab, and I'm going to put some chic on here.
					And I'm going to have myself a little wrap.
					See how it tastes.
					What do you think? Delicious.<br>
					Super good.
					One more interesting fact. My wife is dying to eat this. So, let me be really quick. Two interesting
					facts very quick.
					We'll end this video. There are two cities in ancient Turkey. I don't know if I'm saying them right,
					but Termesos and Silian, these were the only two cities in all of Asia Minor that Alexander the
					Great could not conquer.<br>
					So that makes me think that the Turkish people must be a brave and strong people because Alexander
					the Great took over pretty much the whole world, but he could not with you guys.<br>
					The next interesting fact is that one of the national sports of Turkey is olive oil wrestling.
					So the wrestlers put olive oil on and then they wrestle. I'm starting to think that's why Alexander
					could not mess with them. Alexander the Great came and was like, "I'm going to take these people
					over." They poured the olive oil on themselves and said, "Come on, Alex." All right, guys. I hope
					you enjoy this video. My wife and I worked very hard on it. We're going to have a great dinner now.
					Thank you so much for spending your time with me, guys. I appreciate every single one of you. I
					appreciate your cultures. I appreciate you wanting to be here with me learning English.<br> Thanks a
					lot. See you in the next video.
