					Oh, hey guys. Nice to see you. I didn't notice you guys there. Just kidding.
					Okay. Hello, my friends. Guess where I am right now. Did you guess? I'm going to give you a little
					hint.
					 Did you understand that? Me neither. Guys, we are in Montreal, a city in Canada, a city that
					is very interesting where they speak French and English. And I am super happy because this is the
					first time in my life I've heard people speaking French in real life. Not on my phone, not on the
					TV.
					I'm super excited. It's only 3:00 p.m. right now, but we've had a long day already and some cool
					things have happened already. So, I just want to tell you guys a little bit about our day getting
					here and what we're going to do on this trip.
					So, the flight was really short, but we had to get up early. We got up at 5:30 this morning and it
					was an hour and a half flight, super easy. But after that, something interesting happened. We got an
					Uber. We got an Uber and I was looking on the phone and it said that the driver, he spoke French and
					Spanish.
					So, I said, "Miss Palu, Espanol." And he said, "Yes." And this guy was from Haiti, guys. and he was
					a polyglot. He spoke Haitian creole, he spoke French, spoke English, Portuguese, and Spanish.
					And his Spanish was super good. So, we got to speak a little bit of French and Spanish with him.
					Then we uh Wait, that wasn't our first interesting thing, was it? What did I do? Esposa, you speak
					in French to a lady who really understand understood everything that you said. So, I got to have my
					first conversation in real life in French. So, guys, I changed some money from United States dollars
					to Canadian dollars. I'm going to show you those in a second. But uh at the airport they have these
					little desk where you can give them your money and they give you back the money of the country that
					you're in. You guys know that they're in all the airports.
					But we went there and she said hello and I said in French, can I practice my French with you? And
					then she said yes.
					And then she started she started talking really fast but I understood and I think I did pretty good.
					My wife was just sitting there like, "So, I think I did pretty good. I was able to tell her what my
					phone number was in uh French." I told her where we were from, and it was it was pretty cool. She
					asked me, and I'm going to take this as a huge compliment. She asked me, "Where are you from? Are
					you French or from the United States?" So, I was like, "Yes." Proud moment, guys. Anyway, let's take
					a look at this money. It's pretty cool. So, this is a $50 bill. Oh, son.
					Canadian. And guys, you can see through.
					See me? Mhm. Uh, this money is not like the money in the United States. In the United States, it's
					paper, but this feels like plastic. And, uh, it's really cool. It doesn't smell like money because
					the Colombian money smells like United States money. So, it's paper money.
					Paper money smells like money no matter where you're at. But this is plastic and it has no smell. I
					feel like if you get wet this money, it doesn't like I think you could probably put this money in
					water and pull it out. This is a $5 bill. And I'm going to keep this one for my son because it has a
					little spaceman on it. He'll think that's super cool. And then this one my wife likes the best
					because she's feminista and there's a woman. I like the purple color. She likes the purple color. So
					let me see again.
					My mom likes purple, too. Maybe we'll bring her one. All right, guys. That's the money.
					Uh, then when we got here, we came to our hotel, but the room was not ready yet, and we were hungry.
					So, we had to try something that is the most famous food in Montreal, which is poutine.
					poutine. Poutine mossy. So, we ate some poutine.
					Uh, it was okay, guys. I'm going be honest. I wish I could say it was awesome, but I think it would
					be great if you were drunk. If you were Boracho, I think it would be super good. It's like a good
					food to go with beer and partying when you've been out all night.
					But for just normal people walking around, it's very heavy. Super heavy.
					French fries, uh, salsa and meat and a ton of cheese. It was good, but very, very heavy. So, we had
					some poutine.
					Now, we're going to take showers, chill out for a little bit. I am tired already. We only slept for
					a few hours last night, but there's a bookstore that's really close that has food, coffee, and
					books. And I want to buy a book and French. So, we're going to do that. I'll talk to you guys a
					little later. Let me go get a shower because I don't smell that good. All right, guys.
					Today, we find ourselves in Little Italy in Montreal. And this is a very famous market called Jean
					Talon. And it's incredible. I wish we lived here so we could buy our groceries here. This store has
					got fresh oysters, fresh seafood. I saw an organic meat store. So, we're going to walk around and
					show you guys some of the good stuff they have here.
					Let's check it out.
					 It's incredible. There's fresh ingredients everywhere. A lot of organic stuff. There's just
					not places like this where we live. And this is like oldfashioned how humans are supposed to eat.
					Wonderful.
					  All right, guys. We got a sausage sandwich with mustard, some sauerkraut, and a
					sausage that has bacon and cheese in it. We're going to see delicious. My wife's going to love it.
					And yeah, I ordered it all in French. Super happy about that. The lady was very sweet with me and
					she spoke a little slow. People are nice here, I think.
					excited about the best incredible  yummy. Wow. It's like eating ham with pizza, but it's
					apple.
					All right.
					Wow.
					 Never had anything like this.
					I say heat.
					Now we're in Chinatown in Montreal and we're looking for something good to eat.
					 Heat. Heat.
					Oh, hey guys. We've been walking around Montreal all day. We're tired, but we've done so many cool
					things. Hope you guys have enjoyed seeing some of the cool stuff we did. Uh, I didn't show you guys
					this cool book I got in French. That was one of my goals on my checklist was to find a book in
					French. And I got this one because it's not too big and I already basically know what it's about.
					It's a a guy named Echar Toli. It's like a a spiritual thing. This is uh which is the power of now
					in English and it's about being mindful. So I really like stuff like this. So, we got this. This is
					going to help me with my French because guys, being here has really motivated me to get better so we
					could go to other places where they speak French. And we've already had some cool experiences. You
					know, just chatting with people. A sweet old lady earlier today was really nice to us. And uh some
					girl told me I look like I was 21. I told her I was 33 and she said, "No, you look like you're 21."
					I was like, "Stop.
					Just kidding, guys. My wife's making faces now. But we were in uh Little Italy and we got something
					called a canoli. So, we got two desserts really, but my wife, she ate hers earlier, so this one's
					mine. Do you guys know what a canoli is?
					Let me show you. This looks so good.
					We've been walking all day, so I don't have to feel like a gordo. So, guys, this is a canoli with
					pistachio. This is a pistachio cream in here. And I've been waiting all day for this. No.
					Very good, guys. All right, I'm going to eat this.
					Talk to you guys later.
					Hey guys, we are in old Montreal or in French like they say v multip trying to enjoy our last day
					here. And the thing about this part of the city is the old architecture and they say it's a very
					European feeling city the way that the buildings are made and there's a lot of cool places around
					here. We're by these old government buildings. Baby show. So, we're going to show you guys some of
					the cool things we see. I just want to tell you guys something super cool that we just did. We met
					up for a French language meetup and it was a group of maybe like 10 people and we all just practiced
					French. We we played little board games and it was super cool. My poor little wife didn't understand
					much, but uh I had a lot of fun and the people there were super cool because people who learn
					languages are cool people like you guys, like me. All right, guys. We'll show you if we find
					something cool. All right, guys. Old Montreal.
					 We had to get my wife a hat. Now she's happy.
					All right, guys. So, we made it to the last part of our Montreal journey. I'm on top of Mount Royal,
					and Mount Royal is actually where the city got its name.
					So, I just walked up this mountain. I'm up here on the top of Mount Royal where you can see all of
					Montreal. So, I'm going to show you this beautiful view up here. Man, guys, this city was great. I
					didn't share everything that we did here. because this was kind of a special trip between my wife
					and I, but I should shared what I could with you guys. So, let's check out this beautiful view. I'll
					show you what I can see right now and that'll be the end of this adventure. Let me find a good spot
					to show you guys.
					Here we go.
					Sorry guys, I almost forgot the most important part. head as famous Romeo.
