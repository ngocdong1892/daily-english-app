					hello my friends hello and welcome back to pensano Eng I am Kyle and here on my channel I bring you
					real English real English that you can understand and today today we have another very interesting
					and useful topic that I think is going to help you guys on your English learning Journey okay a
					subscriber named Brian he asked me the question and more or less MOS the question was why is it so
					so difficult to understand movies and TV shows in English Brian says Kyle I can understand you when
					you're speaking I can understand a lot of other YouTubers in English but when I put on a TV show or
					a movie all of a sudden I can't understand why is this what's going on here guys all right so let's
					talk about a couple of the reasons why it is so difficult to understand a movie or a TV show
					compared to a a video like this where it's just me talking well one of the first reasons is because
					often times in a movie or a TV show there are multiple people or a group of people talking all at
					once okay sometimes they're interrupting each other sometimes they're talking very fast back and
					forth arguing fighting okay now in a YouTube video like this you can look right at my face you can
					focus on my mouth moving and you can really pay attention to me it's one person talking right to you
					okay for that reason you could focus right on me but in a TV show where it's a group of people
					talking is you're trying to focus on one person and just when you start to understand them the next
					person starts talking so you look at them and just when you start to understand them the next next
					person starts talking maybe there's a third person and a fourth person okay for that reason it is
					super difficult all right because a lot of times there's multiple people and it's just obviously
					it's much easier to focus on one person like you are doing right now than to focus on a group the
					second reason that it is difficult to understand the spoken language in TV shows and movies is
					because there is a lot of distractions okay a lot of distractions very distracting things I put on a
					show yesterday in Spanish while I was thinking about how I was going to do this so for my studying I
					put on a a show in Spanish okay and the first thing I noticed was that while the people were talking
					they had a very loud music in the background okay they were trying to play some suspenseful music
					but it was very loud it was very distracting and with without subtitles I could not even hear what
					the people were saying and I realized they do that in a lot of shows okay so if there's music that
					automatically makes it more difficult but there's also some other things that are often going on in
					these shows okay the people could be fighting they could be kissing they could be dancing they could
					be doing a ton of other activities that make it more difficult okay they could be in a war and
					shooting guns and saying things run go to the right all right but they're shooting a gun and there's
					so many different things happening that it's much more difficult to understand okay because your
					brain is focusing on everything that's happening everything that's happening and you're trying to
					hear all right but right now the only thing in this video that you have to focus on is my my face
					and what I'm saying that's why this is so much easier okay there's no distractions in this video
					it's just me talking and the third reason why shows and movies can be much more difficult is because
					depending on where and when the movie takes place the language used can be completely different okay
					so an example is a show that takes place in the 1950s 70 years ago in the past they're going to use
					an English that is very different than if you were to watch a show that is filmed uh in modern time
					today the slang that we use the way we talk it's going to be completely different okay and there's a
					lot of other factors that can influence the way that these people are speaking English Okay an
					example uh TV show about a group of kids young people okay and their DayDay life this young group of
					kids are going to use a completely different English than a show about an old doctor okay the old
					doctor is going to use a lot smarter vocabulary he's going to use bigger words a lot of his words
					are going to be based on his profession and the group of kids are going to be saying uh a lot of
					dumb things uh slang bruh lit things like that okay and the English is going to be completely
					different between the two okay so depending on when and where the series or movie takes place it
					could be completely different if you're watching British TV or American English or Australian etc
					etc uh this is another reason why it could be quite difficult and when you watch shows you may be
					coming across things that you don't understand okay guys now that we understand the reasons why it
					is more difficult let's investigate how we can put in some work and improve ourselves and be able to
					start understanding these shows and movies first and this one's obvious guys use subtitles okay now
					I I really don't think that if you're watching an American movie you should be watching with uh
					subtitles in Spanish that's too easy but even using subtitles in English will help you to understand
					okay because when your brain is reading and listening at the same time it's a lot more
					comprehensible all right and when you can read the word a lot of times you will be able to
					understand it much better than just listening okay if sometimes I use subtitles in English guys I
					just like subtitles but when I'm watching something in Spanish or when I was watching things in
					French I always use subtitles because for me it's much more enjoyable because then I can understand
					99% so use subtitles guys use subtitles and then once you get to the point where you can understand
					it very well with subtitles you can go ahead and try and get rid of the subtitles and slowly you'll
					be able to understand okay the second thing that we could do is watch familiar content okay watch
					something that you have a base understanding of what do I mean by this well if when you were younger
					you read all of the Harry Potter books watched the Harry Potter movies in English okay you know who
					Dumbledore is who hewig is and who Harry Hermione and Ron are and you know about the school you know
					about these spells and things that they're doing so because you already know about this universe the
					Harry Potter story it will be much more understandable for you to watch Harry Potter in English Okay
					some other examples are to watch content about things that you are familiar with okay if you like
					cars watch some shows about cars all right if you like to cook watch cooking shows things like that
					will give you an advantage because you will you will be able to understand what they are talking
					about based on what you are seeing okay so when you watch things that you're familiar with it'll
					make it much easier to understand the third thing that we can do you take notes okay now I don't
					mean you have to sit there with a notepad and write down everything you see on your show but you can
					make in your notes on your phone and when you see a phrase on the subtitles that you don't
					understand take your remote control pause type it in and go look it up later okay I don't think you
					should stop right there and look it up put it make a list and check it out later okay I think that
					you should keep watching the show even if you don't understand little pieces just keep going okay
					keep going and guys a lot of times what happens to me is they'll say something I don't understand it
					but then 1 minute later they keep talking about that topic what they were talking about and through
					context I begin to understand and then I say oh that's what that word meant oh that's what he meant
					by that phrase okay so guys when you when you hear a word or a phrase that you don't understand
					don't automatically think oh man I didn't understand that now I'm lost no keep on paying attention
					Okay because maybe there will be some clues in the next few seconds that will help you to understand
					it and the last thing that you can do to help you understand uh movies and shows in your second
					language guys fully immerse yourself in this language okay and what I mean by this is consume a wide
					variety of content okay listen to podcasts read books look at websites look at social media uh watch
					YouTube videos all right but even more than that guys look at a wide variety of topics okay okay
					anything you're interested in check it out in English okay if you're trying to get a job as a chef
					look at stuff about cooking in English recipes if you like photography uh look for YouTube videos
					about photography and guys when we start to really Branch out and consume a wider variety of content
					we will start to uh to acquire a much larger and wider vocabulary and this will help us to
					understand and movies and shows that may be talking about a wide variety of different things all
					right reading guys is huge even if you just read an article a day in your second language about a
					different topic read about health read about science read about space okay read about working out
					read an article okay that will expose you to a huge amount of vocabulary that may help you in the
					future to better understand a show or movie all right my friends I hope that maybe this cleared up
					some of your doubts maybe it helps you to understand why you're having trouble understanding shows
					and movies and maybe some of the tips can help you to better understand and advance in your journey
					of learning English I hope this video was useful to you and I hope you enjoyed some quality
					comprehensible input PR
