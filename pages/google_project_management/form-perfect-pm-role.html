					a
					challenge.<br />Even the most detailed, specific job listings can leave you wondering what the
					company
					is really seeking in a candidate.<br />Don’t worry.<br />We’ve all been there.<br />And we’re here
					to
					help you sort through the lingo and the confusion.<br />The more job listings you find, the more
					buzzwords you’ll likely notice, too, words like data-driven, team player,
					self-starter.<br />Understanding all the buzzwords in job listings will help figure out if a job is
					right for you.<br />Up to now, we’ve discussed project management as a role.<br />But many companies
					actually list it as a skill.<br />The Project Management Institute estimates that every year, there
					are
					500,000 jobs that list project management as a skill.<br />Here’s some more good news.<br />You’ll
					soon
					be qualified for a position as a project manager and a position that lists project management as a
					skill.<br />Here’s the even better news.<br />If you have the skills to manage projects, you’ll be
					qualified for program manager or operational roles that require you to manage an end-to-end system
					or
					department too, which ask for the same skill set.<br />Now, let’s check out different types of jobs
					that
					use your project management skills.<br />When job hunting, keep your options open.<br />As I just
					mentioned, you don’t have to limit yourself to just project manager titles.<br />There’s lots of
					other
					titles you’re qualified for, too.<br />You’ll know what’s a good fit for you by reading the job
					descriptions.<br />So cast a wide net.<br />Depending on the field you choose, you might find roles
					like
					operations manager, program manager, operations associate, or project assistant.<br />All of these
					could
					be a great fit for your skills.<br />For example, let’s say you’re searching a job board for project
					management roles when you notice a community operations manager role for a small city open
					up.<br />The
					job title isn’t project manager, but you’ll notice that the job functions match your skill
					set.<br />And
					years of experience also match the job requirements.<br />The job description may include a list of
					required skills like organizational management, strong planning and communication skills, budget
					preparation and monitoring.<br />Sound familiar?<br />Maybe you’ll even start to notice that the
					job’s
					responsibilities seem like tasks you’ve covered in this course, like creating monthly status
					reports,
					helping to implement new and necessary technologies, tracking work plans and performance metrics,
					assisting other members of the operations team on given projects, and ensuring timely responses to
					requests for information.<br />These duties are nearly a perfect match for your project management
					skills.<br />And there are plenty more listings like these, too.<br />How great is that?<br />The
					skills
					that go into project management are used in all kinds of roles and professions.<br />Believe it or
					not,
					we’ve all worked with or learned from a project manager at some point in the past.<br />Can you
					guess
					who that is?<br />Your teachers.<br />Think about it.<br />Everything that goes into being a teacher
					takes project management skills, designing a curriculum that’s accessible to students with unique
					needs,
					managing a budget, communicating with others like parents, department heads, or school admins,
					developing processes to make things run efficiently in the classroom, and so on.<br />For example,
					when
					I went for my first interview at Google, I highlighted my experience as the founder and advisor to a
					student leadership group.<br />I told them about how I assembled and led a team of 20 students to
					plan
					and execute events like fundraisers, community gatherings, and academic assemblies for over 300
					students
					during the academic year.<br />I even kind of surprised myself looking back at how much relevant
					project
					management experience I had.<br />Now, I’m sure you’ll think back on your own experiences and feel
					the
					same thing.<br />One more thing to call out is networking.<br />Networking is when you meet other
					people
					in a professional setting with the goal of learning, sharing knowledge, and creating new business
					connections.<br />This plays a big role in job hunting.<br />So it is a great tool to start learning
					and
					perfecting.<br />The skills you learn here will prepare you for all kinds of project management
					jobs.<br />Knowing how to search for jobs will make it even easier to match those skills with the
					best
					opportunities for you.<br />[MUSIC PLAYING]<br /></p>
