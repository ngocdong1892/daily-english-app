					Are you ready to learn some real life English? Good. Cuz today we are going to learn some real
					English with comprehensible input. Today we are going to talk about health and things that you can
					do to be healthier. Let's go. Hello again, my friends. It is your English speakaking friend Kyle and
					today we are going to improve our English with comprehensible input. What is comprehensible input?
					Comprehensible input is when a native speaker like me, I'm a native English speaker to you in a slow
					and clear way that you can understand. Today we are going to talk about something that is so
					important.<br>
					Does not matter what language you speak or where you are in the world. This is something that is
					very important to you and to me. Our health. Being healthy.
					Health is so important, guys, and it can really improve your life or make it much, much worse. So,
					today I'm going to show you guys the things that I do every day to try my best to be healthy so that
					I can live a long and happy life for myself and for my family. So, guys, this video is going to have
					two different parts. The first part we're going to talk about the things I do for my physical
					health, my body, my body, my physical health. And later we're going to talk about the things that I
					do for my mental health, which is just as important. The two things go together.<br>
					Believe me, guys, because I have had problems with both of them. So guys, the first thing the first
					thing that I do every single day to help take care of my physical health, to help take care of my
					body is I walk. I walk every single day, guys. I try and make sure I come to a place like this. We
					call this a trail or a walking path. I come to a place like this and I walk. Sometimes I listen to
					podcast or listen to things in Spanish or French. Sometimes I just listen to the nature. I can hear
					the birds singing and I find that to be very peaceful. So guys, walking is super important. It helps
					you keep your weight down and it helps to improve your cardiovascular health. And your
					cardiovascular health means your breathing and the way that your blood flows through your body. So,
					walking is super good for you. And I try my best to get 10,000 steps a day. A step, boom, boom, one
					step, two step, three step. I try and get 10,000 of those a day. Some days it does not work.
					Some days I do a little bit more, but that is the goal with my walking. And I feel so much better
					when I do it, guys.<br>
					So, number one, walk. Okay, guys. I had a nice walk. Now I'm going to do something else that is
					super important for physical health, also mental health, but very important for me. Going to the
					gym. Going to the gym and lifting weights. Okay? It's good for your physical health to have more
					muscle on your body. But for me, it makes me feel so much better about myself. When you like the way
					that you look, when you like how you look, you're happier. You feel good. your mental health is
					better and your body feels good, too. So, I'm gonna go into the gym and get a good workout. Okay,
					guys. So, today I am doing an upper body focused workout. And your upper body is your back, your
					shoulders, your chest, and your arms.<br>
					These are pull-ups, and I did them with an extra weight around my body, an extra 20 lbs, because I'm
					really trying to build strength with this. These we call dips. They focus on your chest, uh the back
					of your arms, and your shoulders.<br>
					It's another great strength building exercise, one of my favorites. These are called seated rows.
					They're called rows because it is just like the movement of rowing a boat.<br>
					These are seated cable rows because I'm doing them with a cable.<br>
					And these are called upright rows. They work your shoulders and your biceps and your upper back. I'm
					going pretty light on these because I have a shoulder injury that I'm trying to take care of.
					Just finished up at the gym. had a really good workout. I'm feeling really good because I've been
					very committed lately. I've been going several times a week and I'm proud for that. Working out
					makes you feel good. Like I said before, that's one of the best things about it.<br>
					All right, guys. Now the next thing that I find so important for taking care of my health is making
					sure that I eat good foods, healthy foods and that I do not do not eat too much too much. Okay?
					Because that is a weakness of mine. That is a weakness of mine. That is something that I have to
					really work hard on because if I do not think about it, I will just eat and eat and eat. I love
					food. So, I have to really think about it before I start talking about how I make sure that I don't
					eat too much and how I've been doing really good lately and eating healthy foods and the right
					amount of foods. Let me show you something that I do sometimes after a workout. I'm going to have a
					protein shake. Okay, a shake. Now, it's called a protein shake because you shake it up.<br>
					Shake it up to shake. I am shaking this bottle right now. I am shaking it. Okay, so they call it a
					protein shake because you shake it up to shake the verb to shake. Now, I do not think that protein
					powder is necessarily healthy or bad for you, but if you're trying to build muscle, trying to build
					trying to make your muscles bigger, it can help you to get the protein that your body needs to
					build. So, I looked online. And I looked and I looked and I looked and I found a brand that only has
					a couple of ingredients because I do not like it when they put a million different ingredients in
					protein or in food. That cannot be good for your health. So when I'm looking for food, I look for
					things that only have a little bit of ingredients, different things that's inside of it. This only
					has three different things. whey protein, which is a protein that comes from milk. It has sugar from
					coconuts, organic sugar from coconuts, and dried strawberries because it's a strawberry flavored
					protein.<br>
					Okay. So, I'm going to use milk in my protein shake. I'm going to put one cup one cup of milk. And I
					know, guys, this is a measurement that you do not use. I don't think anywhere in the anywhere else
					in the world they use cups. I think it's only US. Possibly in Britain, but I am not sure. One cup of
					milk and then two scoops of protein. Now to scoop means to take a spoon and you can scoop ice cream.
					Okay? You can do scoops of protein powder. Protein powder comes with this so that you can measure
					it.<br>
					And this is called a scooper because you use it to scoop your protein. And I'm going to use two
					scoops. One and two.<br>
					Now I will put the lid on to my protein shaker. And shake. To shake. I am shaking. Shaking. Shaking.
					Shaking my protein shake. To shake. You guys will never forget the verb to shake. Now you can
					remember. Oh yeah, that's right.<br>
					Kyle shook his protein shake. That's good.
					All right, guys. So, let me explain to you a little bit about my weakness. My weakness for food. So,
					guys, if you want to improve, it's important that you know that you recognize your weaknesses, that
					you recognize the things that you do not do very good, the things that you need to really work on.
					And for me, I have always been a big eater. I've loved to eat, okay? When I was younger, I was
					overweight. And really, guys, the only reason that I am not really overweight now is because I love
					to exercise, okay?<br>
					Because I eat a lot. But lately, I have really been making sure that I do not eat too much. And how
					I do that is I count my calories, okay? I count the calories that I eat and I count the protein
					because I'm trying to build muscle. Okay? So, this has been helping me. so much, guys. I'm counting
					every calorie that I put in my body. And this way, I know I am not eating too much, and I know that
					I'm getting enough protein to get stronger and for my muscles to grow. So, I know you're thinking,
					"Wow, that's a lot of work." Or some of you guys probably do it already. Some of you guys who are
					who are fit probably do it already. It seems like it could be a lot of work, but once you get into
					the habit, it's not that bad. And the way that I've been doing it is I meal prepped, guys. I've been
					doing meal prepping. Okay? I told you guys in another video what meal prepping is.<br>
					It's when you make a bunch of meals and then you can eat them for the next week, 2 weeks. You put
					them in your in your freezer. You put them in your freezer and you take them out the day before you
					need them. You heat them up and you're ready to go. So, let me show you how easy it is with some of
					the the meal preps that I've made. All right, guys.<br>
					These are some of the meals that I prepped a couple days ago. 3 days ago, I cooked for a couple of
					hours. Okay, I cooked for a couple of hours. And now, I do not have to cook for days. So, what do we
					have here? This is turkey, ground turkey, potatoes, a cheese, and vegetables. And right here I have
					the calories and the protein. So I know if I take one of these, it's 700 calories and 71 g of
					protein. Super easy. Here I have my pasta that has ground beef, noodles, and a tomato sauce. I know
					that if I take one of these, it's bigger and it has 1,000 calories, 67 g of protein. And then I made
					here I've got burritos made out of beef and cheese. And then I have breakfast burritos that have uh
					turkey sausage, eggs, and cheese. So guys, let's see. I have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10.
					10 meals right here. So for the next 10 meals, I do not have to think about anything. All right,
					that is awesome.<br>
					Saves me time. And I know because I already did the math. I counted how many calories are in each of
					these. I know how much calories I'm eating. And that is super good for my body. It's good for my
					mental health because I'm not stressed about food. And it saves me so much time, guys. Now I don't
					have to cook for a week. So I could do so many other things with that time like make videos to help
					you guys with your English. All right, friends. So, another thing that is super important for me is
					hydration. Hydration means that your body has all of the water that it needs.<br>
					It's super important. Uh, but it's super important especially for me for a couple of different
					reasons. One, I drink a lot of coffee and coffee dehydrates you. So, I have to remember to drink a
					lot of water to put that that hydration back into my body. Number two, my job. I work long hours and
					it's very hot. Okay? So, when you sweat, when you sweat, you lose your hydration and you have to put
					it back into your body. So, something that I've learned recently is that just drinking water by
					itself, just water is good, but your body also needs certain minerals to stay hydrated. So, this is
					a supplement, guys. A supplement. A supplement means something that you add to your diet. Okay? We
					don't call food supplements. We call protein shakes are supplements. This is a supplement because
					it's uh minerals. Let's see. We call vitamins supplements. This is a hydration supplement. It has
					sodium, potassium, and magnesium. This is really good, but it's expensive. So, I do not buy these. I
					just bought a a pack a small pack of this to try. So, let me show you what I do. That is much
					cheaper. I buy a good sea salt. Okay, sea salt means salt from the from the ocean. Okay. And this is
					French sea salt.<br>
					Oh. All right, guys. So, I bought some good sea salt. And the thing about salt, guys, sodium helps
					your body to hold on to the water. Okay? If I just drink a bunch of water, when I go to the
					bathroom, you guys saw the bathroom video the other day. If I go to the bathroom, all that water is
					just going to go out of me. Okay? But if you take some salt, that water will be absorbed into your
					body and you'll be better hydrated. So what I do with this guys, some people like to put a scoop
					into their water. I like to just put a little bit in my hand, little bit in my hand like that, and
					eat it. That is salty.<br>
					That's how we describe something that has a lot of salt in it. The way it tastes, we say, "Ooh,
					that's salty." So what I do in the morning, guys, I take some of that. I put it in my hand, I eat
					it, and then I drink a big glass of water. All right, guys. And that is what I've been focusing on
					as far as my food.<br>
					I count my calories. I count my protein.
					I make sure that I'm getting the right amount of calories, but not too much.
					And I make sure I'm getting enough protein to build muscle. And I make sure that I stay hydrated.
					And that's all in the kitchen, guys. Now, those were the things that I practice to keep my body
					healthy. Now, we're going to talk about mental health, which is as important or more important than
					your physical health. Okay? So, the most important thing, guys, the most important without a doubt
					that I do for my mental health is meditating. Okay? Meditation is a key for me. And I'm going to do
					a little meditation right now. Sometimes I listen to music in my headphones to help me meditate, but
					today it's raining outside, so I'm going to use the natural sounds. Maybe thunder, thunder, and
					rain. Ooh, that's going to be so nice, guys. So, I'm going to do a quick 5minute meditation.
					I'm going to set a timer on my phone and then I'll explain to you guys what I'm doing in my mind.
					See you in 5 minutes.<br>
					All right, guys. 5 minutes.
					It's always a surprise when I hear the alarm go off because when you get into a good state of
					meditation, you're not thinking about time. So, that was very nice. Uh, feel good, guys. Uh, my legs
					are getting a little bit wet. So, let's go inside and I'll talk to you guys about my thoughts on
					meditation and my personal meditation practice. See you in a second. All right, guys. So, 5 minutes
					of meditation done. I re very, very rarely do meditations that short, but it's raining outside and
					I'm trying to make this video. So, that was a small example of what I do. I would say that my
					meditations usually can be anywhere from 15 minutes to 1 hour and my record the best I've ever done
					was 2 hours. So let me tell you guys why meditation is so important for my my mental health.
					Okay, first of all there are so many studies proving it is not an opinion. It is a fact that
					meditation is good for your mental health. It reduces anxiety. It reduces your blood pressure.
					It improves physical and mental health.<br>
					That is not my opinion. That is a fact.
					That's reason number one why meditation is incredible. Meditation for me has helped me in the
					following way. It has helped me to become a much more calm person, a person who does not get angry
					as often. And it has helped me to deal with negative thinking, negative thinking, bad thoughts.
					Okay, it's training your mind. Okay, meditation is working out for your brain. And that's why I love
					it. So in that five minute meditation what I did guys what I do in these short meditations a lot of
					people like to focus on their breathing they'll focus on their breath coming in through their nose
					and down into their lungs feel it leaving and that's great but that's not what I like to do. I like
					to put my attention my focus right here in the front of my head. I put it right here. I keep my
					focus right here and I do not think about anything. All I think about is keeping my attention right
					there. And when my attention tries to go away on a different thought, I bring it back. And in a
					minute or two, it tries to run away with a different thought, I bring it back. And guys, this
					teaches you not to overthink, not to let your brain control you, but for you to control your brain.
					And this is the best thing that I have ever done for my mental health. All right guys, now the next
					one that is almost as important for me as the meditation learning. Guys, I learn constantly.
					Never stop learning. Never. What is what do I mean by constant learning? Guys, if you look at my
					house, you will see books everywhere. Okay, I'm sitting on the floor right now and there's a book
					within reach. There's a book within reach. Okay, this is a book I'm reading and it's just sitting on
					my couch in my home. There are books everywhere. I have no idea how many books I've read, guys.
					Never stop consuming information and growing. Learning Spanish has improved my life in so many ways.
					It's the reason why I have my wife. And learning French has been an incredible adventure for me as
					well. The best thing to me about learning languages, it allows you to see so much more of the world.
					When you learn a new language, your world gets bigger. You can travel to new places.<br>
					You can learn about new cultures. You can meet new people. Guys, I can't tell you how many
					incredible people I've had conversations with on my language learning journey. how many cool shows
					and movies I've seen in French and Spanish and friends I've made speaking in my second and third
					languages. So language learning is very very special for me. It holds a special place in my heart
					and a huge place in my mind and in my mental health routine. And without language learning I would
					not have this channel which is also a big part of my life. Something that I focus on. It gives me
					something positive to focus on and it makes me very happy. I get very happy when I get to read your
					guys's comments. When I get to put out a new video that I know will help you guys.<br>
					That makes me feel like I have a purpose in my life. It makes me feel like I'm doing something good
					for the world and it makes me feel like I'm helping people. So, thank you guys for being a part of
					one of the best things in my life. This community, this YouTube channel. I appreciate you all very
					much.<br>
					Thank you for watching, my friends.
