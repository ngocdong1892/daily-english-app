					[Laughter] [Laughter] [Music] is united states and like [Music] okay ini today you and i we're going
					to talk about some of the differences the cultural differences in between the united states and
					colombia but also latin america in general yeah okay so uh why don't you tell me the first first
					difference that you want to talk about okay so the first difference is um oh that's so interesting
					like how you can uh found stores like so many stores close to your house in colombia and mexico and
					other countries um but here is so different but i want to tell you how it's like in my country and
					i'm sure you know so you can just walk to the store and say oh i need use two eggs and ah can i have
					please mirror can i i don't know like just a couple things and that's it but here if you need
					something what you have to do so here if you want to buy eggs you have to buy 12 of them first of
					all and we don't have stores real close to the house like if i want to go buy food i cannot walk to
					the store i have to drive because it's far away there's a lot of stores but they're all far away you
					have to drive to all of them because they are not close and also it's like a big source so we have
					big stores and we can drive too but you can have uh we say barrios it's like a park for every like
					uh i don't know every part in your city so you can find like five stores so close and it's like a
					lyric store you know so we have both that we can walk to the little ones i will tell you for sure
					that there is no store anywhere near me where i can go and buy two eggs no way anna yes okay so you
					have to think about oh i need this like this wig and just buy everything so okay so the next one and
					it's so interesting too uh and i'm sure you hear about this too and it's uh how we um how is their
					education with the kids so here kyrie's going to explain but i want to say how is in colombia and
					other countries like colombia um so the parents are more like a street with the kids and if you
					don't if you do something wrong they are going to smoke you and um so yeah i mean the parents are
					more like a i don't know the word like um no brows you know come on so we would say like lenient
					lenia means they'll let their kids do more things yeah i mean we are like oh i'm sorry and you know
					they are more like i told you you know yeah so yeah how is here for you and you are adapt so you can
					say okay so um a lot of people maybe think that i'm a little bit more strict on my son than other
					parents yeah she she could see if my son does something that i think is wrong i will tell him don't
					do that stop you know better don't do it but uh and sometimes it hurts his feelings and he he'll cry
					but i tell him it is my job to teach you the right way to act to how to be a good person but sadly
					there's a lot of people here in the u.s who do not teach their kids right and wrong and they let
					their kids run around in the store and scream scream and talk really loud in in a church or in a
					restaurant and sometimes there's even kids that yell at their parents yeah shut up mom i hate you
					and the parents don't do anything yeah that's that's my me man if my son says something bad all i
					have to do is look at him i give him a look like this and he knows he did wrong yeah yeah but for me
					that's weird because here here everybody is like okay okay you can do whatever you want you know but
					yeah so good job okay so um let's see that is um so how we like how we are with our friends or like
					when you are like together or you are for a long time [Music] i don't know when the wave is um so we
					always is we hug and we uh kiss in the chick or like that um so like more closer you know um so okay
					for me here that's two different too it is very different so you whenever you see your family or
					friends in colombia or latin america you can kiss on the cheek yeah um here it's not like that
					sometimes i'll give my grandma me abuela a hug and kiss her on the cheek but that's about it when
					you if you're a man i don't know how men greet each other but men here either shake hands like this
					or sometimes this and you give each other a hug like that yeah but uh you know uh if i see a a woman
					that i know i'm not gonna kiss her on the cheek i we don't even usually men won't even touch women
					when they say hi it's just oh hey nice to see you yeah um but if you see a man who you know you know
					you'll shake hands like that or sometimes when i see my brother we do this yes stuff like that but
					uh yeah we don't we don't greet each other the same like even close families yeah even between like
					family is so different they never are like oh bye see you tomorrow or see you you know they're just
					like um nice to see you again bye see you later and that's it bye so i just like what are you all
					yeah i'm glossy as like oh it's very nice are mad i imagine it's going to be very different one day
					when if i go to a different country and see it it's going to be weird for me okay so our next one is
					so the next one is how is the customs and in my country uh it's like always the woman is who cook in
					the house who make the food so who clean is just a woman i mean i am sure there is a lot of mens who
					her um the wife or his their wives their wives um but i am sure it's just it's more you know just a
					couple so what i mean is more more more woman's is who clean and who make the food okay so that's
					normal for us it's like oh that's fine even when they work to when the wife or is working too she's
					always like more oh i have to do this i have to do this but here is different because well here
					there's a lot of men who like to cook for example i cook every single day i cook i make food when
					eenie's with me i make food for us i make food for myself and my son every day for me it's a little
					bit different because i live alone in my house just me and my son we live together so i have to cook
					i have to cook i have to clean but even if i did have a wife i would still want to cook because i
					love cooking i love to eat my food that i make and i enjoy cooking and i think that that's more
					common here a lot of men here like to cook on the grill this is a grill people like to cook on the
					grill like men like to do that outside that's a man way to cook a lot of men like to cook on the
					grill and i think i think it's more normal here for men to help their wives too at home yeah i think
					it's absolutely they here is like i think that once they cook just like some women do not different
					like here is different no commodities the opposite the opposite like in colombia then it is um oh so
					the food but i know everybody here about the food in the united states is so different i know you
					know that but so what i want to talk about is how is like so important dinner here and how is so
					important for us breakfast and lunch for us and you can eat maybe just something small for dinner
					and colombia and that's fine um sometimes the people is i don't wanna today i don't wanna have
					dinner today and it's fine um but my bread pots my lunch have to be good you know the rice beans
					with meat of course um but here they don't care it's oh it's 11 it's fine we can have a sandwich and
					they don't eat anything for pep bread but so and then how is the dinner when they're going to sleep
					but they they like to eat like kind early so it's fine like five o'clock or five three um yeah so
					for me i don't care about breakfast i never eat breakfast i usually eat it at noon i'll eat at noon
					and then i'll eat again at maybe seven or eight at night but for me i like a big dinner a big piece
					of meat and maybe a little bit of vegetables or something but she wants a bunch of rice bunch of
					vegetables i mean our rice always yeah so another thing is uh so for for breakfast here a lot of
					people eat really bad food though just eat cereal oh yeah or pancakes with a bunch of sugar and
					syrup and yeah that's what the kids eat here and it's not healthy it's not good yeah so sometimes
					i'll get my kid to eat eggs and i'm happy because it's healthy but a lot of kids just want cereal
					with a bunch of sugar in it and uh that's not a good way to start your day yeah um yeah i mean this
					is hard for me to oh sandwich for lunch oh my god i want rice and chicken and beef okay wherever
					that's life here so so yeah so the next one is the way like dressing when you are going to the
					market when you are going to the store when you are going to drive your kids to the school when you
					are going to pick up jurors to your kids i'm sorry for my english um okay so in colombia i'm talking
					about more like colombia um so we are like always oh i have to like dress nice not like chores or
					just kind of this is yeah chores a lot of people wear pajamas yeah yeah yeah so the store just go
					shopping flip flops um so we are yeah so here they're like whatever whatever so that's a big
					difference too um but now i'm like okay i'm fine i can go like this so it's more easy in your life
					trust me just me yeah i wear like uh athletic pants and t-shirts everywhere i go if i go to the
					doctor you know i'm probably wearing yeah that's another sweatpants and stuff but i got to the
					doctor yeah one day i have for first time i really have to go to the doctor and i get the jeans and
					you know like a nice clothes and um so somebody asked me like where are you going and i was like to
					the doctor you're going to the doctor like this like yeah it's not like that date yeah we don't care
					yeah and i was like uh now i think about the fears and i'm like okay i'm fine i don't have to change
					my clothes so it's more like easy yeah for sure oh this one is so good so the way of like saying
					things to them to and like to talk with another people yeah um like if kyle have to tell me
					something he's going to turn me way way he have to turn me by if i have to turn in something are you
					going to events [Laughter] [Music] and i'm just thinking about how can save doubt and they they
					don't think about it they just say where they have to say um so i just don't know but we are like
					around and around around fort say something um but that's a good thing that's i i like that pero son
					frios yeah she said uh that i used to be oh yeah if it's okay wow [Laughter] but um yeah it's true i
					i don't know if it's just a language thing if it's just that's how english speakers are and maybe in
					britain and ireland and australia and everywhere where people speak english um or if it's just
					culture of here in the u.s but if we have something to say you know we say it and don't don't dance
					around it yeah yeah yeah i like that just being you know honest yeah i like that so yeah i mean
					that's um like a couple of differences because i'm sure there's so many um so yeah what do you think
					i think it's interesting and i can't wait to go to columbia one day and see for myself how it is
					there in other parts of latin america as well but uh there's certainly big differences the the one
					big difference that i saw in puerto rico uh which is technically part of the united states but it's
					definitely a latino area yeah uh was the driving the way the roads were uh-huh in puerto rico they
					are not when they're driving they are not going to stop for you you just have to go you got to go
					because they're going to keep going there's no rules no i regress for poor la calle in puerto rico i
					don't is it like that in colombia yeah yeah yeah yeah i when i come here the first time i was just
					walking to see i was like oh they have to go first than me and they was like yeah oh i i started
					like i was just like this and they continue like please go like okay okay please don't hit me so
					yeah that's a big difference too okay so interesting uh i like talking about these things and
					learning about how they are in other parts of the world maybe uh one day when we go on our next trip
					somewhere we'll we'll learn some more differences cultural differences and be able to talk some more
					about that but i think it was an interesting topic i hope that you guys got to hear some good
					english practice you're listening maybe you learn something new about the us or maybe colombia if
					you are not from colombia you're from a different part of the latino world so [Laughter] oh yeah
					sure so if you have idea for something you want to learn in english just talk higher because
					sometimes you are like you can think about a couple things but maybe somebody is oh i would love to
					learn about these or whatever it is don't worry he's going to teach you so it's fine hey so thank
					you for watching videos and see you soon honey thank you for watching kyra's videos and see you soon
					guys [Music] you
