					what is a stereotype what is a stereotype a stereotype is when you assume something about somebody
					you assume something about a person before you know them and you assume this thing about that person
					based on their appearance their race their gender religion where they live etc etc today we are
					going to talk about a controversial subject we are going to talk about stereotypes here in the U.S I
					think this is going to be an interesting video so get ready because it's going to be a long one so
					let's get right into the controversy and start with the most controversial stereotypes let's talk
					about race okay guys so talking about race stereotypes based on race it's kind of a taboo subject
					here in the U.S you're not supposed to talk about these things you're supposed to pretend like
					everybody's the same and you don't notice what color their skin is where they're from how they speak
					things like that but that's not real life and stereotypes exist so today I am going to tell you guys
					some stereotypes about different races here in the US good stereotypes negative stereotypes and then
					we're going to talk about if they are true if they are based on some sort of reality or if they are
					just hate okay if it's just ignorance people being ignorant and judging with no factual evidence
					okay let's start with the race here in the U.S who perhaps has the most stereotypes okay black
					Americans so first let's explore some of the stereotypes about Black Americans that are not very
					negative okay not all stereotypes are negative some stereotypes are almost positive an example of
					this is that a lot of people assume that black Americans are incredible athletes okay that they can
					all run very fast or jump very high and I don't know about you but to me that sounds like a good
					thing I want to be athletic okay so it is a stereotype that black people are more athletic they run
					faster they're great at basketball but the fact of the matter is that that's simply not true there
					are just as many black people here in the U.S who are overweight out of shape unhealthy cannot play
					sports cannot run get tired just walking around okay there are just as many many unhealthy people
					here in the U.S who are black so not all black Americans are incredible athletes however I will say
					that we do have some amazing black athletes here in the U.S and I do not know if this is because
					African Americans they view Sports as a way to get out of poverty for example they think if I get
					really good at basketball I could get a scholarship uh maybe get a good career playing basketball
					that's a that's a chance for me to get out of this bad situation I'm living in okay maybe that's an
					option or perhaps there is something in their genetics it gives them an edge in running or jumping
					another stereotype about Black Americans that is not completely negative is that they all are very
					good dancers and have musical talents like rapping or singing dancing these things and this is also
					not true back when I was rapping I heard a lot of black guys who are not good at all at rap okay who
					should not be rapping but another reason why this stereotype is prevalent and why this is a
					stereotype is because I think music does play a huge part in Black American culture more so than
					other American cultures and obviously there are a lot of black Americans who who love rap music and
					who have tried to rap or be Rappers that's where the stereotype comes from but not all of them are
					good at not all of them are good at it okay now now for some negative stereotypes about my black
					country men and women one stereotype about Black Americans is that they all speak very improper
					English this is called ebonics ebonics is basically a term for black English okay and it basically
					means speaking with improper grammar using words that are not actually words so is this true is this
					true do all black people speak differently than I speak absolutely not absolutely not now just as
					there is a huge difference between how a white man down south in America from Tennessee or Arkansas
					how he speaks and how I speak there are going to be some differences between how I speak and how a
					lot of black people do speak that's just cultural differences but I have also personally met a lot
					of very well spoken a lot of very well-spoken black Americans who speak just like me and I've also
					heard a lot of white people talking in a way that sounds pretty stupid so the way that you speak the
					way you choose to present yourself it has to do with how your parents raised you how you were
					educated where you went to school I don't think it's a race thing another negative stereotype about
					Black Americans This stereotype is that black Americans are much more likely than other races to be
					Thieves to steal things or to be violent criminals now is this one true I will give an example of
					this I'll tell you guys a little story and you can make up your own minds about this and I'll tell
					you what I think so I've had two very good friends Almost best friends who are black black Americans
					in my life okay one was Carl I made this video with my friend Carl and another one we will call him
					Chris okay I used to rap make rap music with Chris and we were very close friends okay now Carl Carl
					is one of the most honorable kind honest amazing people I've ever met okay Carl would never steal
					Carl doesn't lie Carl will treat you with respect now Chris Chris was a different kind of guy okay
					Chris was not somebody who you could trust he once once told me a story about how he was in an
					apartment building where he lived and he went into somebody's somebody's apartment and stole their
					TV okay he walked in and stole their TV and I said well why did you do that he said their front door
					their door was open a little bit so he had to walk in he had to go in and see if there was anything
					in there okay so that just shows you that Chris has no character he is a thief he will steal from a
					stranger but is that because he's black I don't think so let me tell you the key difference okay
					Carl was raised by a mother and a father who loved him he grew up reading the Bible doing sports
					doing good in school and Chris was raised by a drug addicted mother he did not have a father he went
					to school in Gary Indiana a very poor and dangerous place so Chris grew up in a very hard crime
					ridden place and Carl grew up with a family who loved him that's the difference now let me also tell
					you that yes Gary Indiana where Chris grew up is almost all black probably 90 something percent
					black Americans who live there and it is a dangerous place you should not go there you should not
					walk around the streets there it's not a very safe place at all but I will also tell you that I have
					been in places that are 100 white but poor white people and it feels just as dangerous okay so the
					thing here is poverty poverty drugs abuse in the homes these are the things that make criminals not
					race wonderful people come in all colors so do terrible ones all right now my friends time to talk
					about you guys Latinos let's talk about some Latino stereotypes here in the U.S so one that is not
					so negative and maybe could be positive is that all Latinos are very hard workers trabajadores okay
					they work very very hard do tough jobs never complain about working okay that's a stereotype and I
					have seen a lot of wonderful Latino workers in the some of the places I've worked but let me tell
					you the slowest worker I know the laziest guy I know at my job right now is Mexican so not all
					Latinos are good workers now a negative stereotype about Latinos here is that all Latinos here in
					the United States are here illegally without papers and that's just not true either that's just not
					true I know a lot of honest hard-working Latinos who came here the right way they got their visa
					they worked on their citizenship they learn to speak English before they came and did it the hard
					way the right way that you're supposed to by law and on the other hand I know people who are here
					without papers illegally I spent a lot of time with a family who is here without papers I would
					never say anything to possibly identify who they are but they were some of the most amazing people
					I've ever met okay they they welcome me into their home with open arms treated me kindly with
					respect help me with my Spanish taught me about amazing food and we're one of the closest tightest
					families that I've ever met so that is one thing that I have noticed about the Latino people that I
					really admire and it's not really a stereotype but it's something that I have observed is that you
					guys are very close with your siblings with your your moms and dads grandparents much closer than uh
					white Americans or black Americans uh and that's something very positive that I have noticed so
					that's something that I admire very much but I am sure that there's also plenty of people Latino
					people that have terrible relationships with their families and the whole point of this video is
					that we should not be judging people based on what they look like so all Latinos are not here
					illegally and not all Latinos are good workers okay just like every other race there's people who
					have done things that are not completely legal and there's people who work hard and people who are
					complete lazy terrible workers just like everybody else good people bad people all colors okay
					Asians now when I say Asians I'm not only talking about Chinese Japanese okay but Indians as well
					people from India now there's really not a whole lot of bad stereotypes about Asians maybe that they
					speak English with a strong accent and they never learn English very good or I have heard that they
					are bad drivers little dumb things like that but what I think is the biggest stereotype here about
					Asians is that they all do super good in school they all go to college and become doctors or things
					like that okay and hey if that's true is that such a bad thing obviously it's not true that all
					Asians are smart not all of them are doctors and funny enough uh the Asian person who I have been
					closest to in my life is somebody who I've trained a lot of Jiu Jitsu with really good guy he's not
					a doctor he works for the Amazon company making a little bit of money and the funny thing about him
					he's short but he can slam dunk boom a basketball okay he can jump so high so this Asian guy who is
					supposed to be a doctor according to stereotypes he can jump higher than any black person I've ever
					met so once again guys you can never judge or know what someone's gonna be like until you get to
					know them as a person because I would have never assumed by looking at this guy that he can dunk a
					basketball or that he works at an Amazon Factory okay all right guys time to go in on my people time
					to talk about white Americans what are some of the stereotypes about white Americans well some of
					the stereotypes about white Americans are that white Americans are privileged because of their skin
					color they could get better jobs the police do not bother them they have money they grow up in nice
					houses and have more opportunities than all the other races now I'll start by saying I have met some
					very privileged white people some white people whose parents did very well so now they do not have
					any idea what it is like to have to work for a living or they have no idea that there are people in
					this world who have real problems people who don't go on nice vacations and a funny funny story
					about our all-white people privileged as soon as I met my my friend Chris who I rap with once we
					started getting close the first time that he came to my house he said man you white your house is
					supposed to be nicer than this he was so surprised that my house is kind of small you know not a big
					nice house he couldn't believe it he thought that my house was supposed to be a big nice mansion
					because I'm white okay but my house is just normal small you know not a super nice house and he was
					very surprised by that okay I think even though Chris was not a good person honestly and I don't
					hang out with him anymore because he did bad stuff that I didn't want to be around I think I learned
					a whole lot from him about how black Americans live and he learned a whole lot from me about white
					Americans and we both learned that you can't trust stereotypes all the time so another stereotype
					about white people that they put in memes a lot is that white people like to eat boring food without
					flavor Sabor okay without putting spices on it and I'll only talk for myself but I'm the best cook I
					know and my friends of different races will back me up on that so this white person can cook I don't
					know what other white people are eating around here and also another another thing about are all
					white people uh do they all have money are they all privileged there's one place in America where
					you can go and see a whole lot of white people with zero privilege and it is called a trailer park
					okay go to a place like this and you will see so many white people who don't have anything okay and
					I'm not judging any of those people I've been in a trailer park before um we all go through hard
					times in our lives but there will be a lot of white people there who are criminals okay who don't
					have money and who have no privilege and no opportunities all right guys then the last time the last
					thing I want to say is that there's a stereotype about young white males and I was uh I was profiled
					by The Stereotype okay and this story makes me laugh so hard when I think about it but it's super
					embarrassing but I'm going to share it with you guys anyway okay so there's something very sad very
					tragic that has happened sometimes here in the U.S and they're called school shootings okay it's
					when a kid brings a gun to his school boom boom boom and starts shooting people terrible terrible
					thing okay uh you know people have lost family members and lives and it's just awful it's awful but
					usually one thing the shooters have in common they're usually a teenage male a white male the last
					few have been a little bit different but the the classic school shooter is a white male who is uh a
					loner he has no friends he doesn't talk with anybody he's very quiet and maybe weird he wears black
					clothes stuff like that okay those That's The Stereotype of what you would consider a school shooter
					okay now when I was in school I had friends I had my friends but I was a I'm I'm kind of a quiet guy
					I'm not a very loud talker you know I've changed a lot believe me I know you guys think oh this guy
					talks all the time he makes videos on YouTube but back then I was a bit shy and if I was not with my
					friends I didn't talk a lot so one day I was in a class and none of my friends were in there so I
					never talked in that class and I did not bring my pencil to class so I asked the teacher if I could
					have a pencil and the teacher said no I don't have one for you does anybody in here have a a pencil
					for Mr singer and one girl she gave me a pencil and she said okay I was nice to you so now when you
					bring a gun to school and kill everybody don't kill me that really hurt my feelings because I was a
					nice guy I was just a little bit shy I told that story uh a little while ago to somebody and I was
					crying laughing because it was so so crazy to hear somebody judge me like that because I was a
					little bit quiet I was a nice kid I was just shy and I don't know probably scared to talk to the
					girls alright guys moral of this video don't judge people by their their outside appearance some of
					the most wonderful experiences I've had in my life are when I've opened up and been been open to
					making a new friendship relationship with somebody of a different culture or race I've learned a
					whole lot about the world a lot about life from people who are completely different from myself so
					keep an open mind keep some open eyes keep on learning English
