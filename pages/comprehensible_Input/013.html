					Are you ready to learn real life English with comprehensible input? Well, good, because today we are
					going to do something that millions of people all around the world do. Some do it to eat, some do it
					just for fun. Today we're going fishing. Let's catch a fish. Okay, guys. Like I said, today we are
					going fishing. But before we go, I need some coffee. So, I got this new espresso machine. I wanted
					to show you guys. I thought we could get some really good English. I'm going to show you guys how I
					make a nice cup of espresso. So, first, what do you call these? White beans. Coffee beans. Coffee
					beans. All right, guys. So, these are coffee beans.<br>
					You can buy the coffee already ground up. I'm going to show you guys what ground up means in a
					second. But they say that it's fresher and it tastes better if you buy it as beans and then you
					grind it yourself. So that's what we're going to do. This guys is called a coffee grinder. And I'm
					going to show you right now the verb to grind. Okay guys, this is grinding coffee. Grinding to
					grind. Right now I am grinding coffee beans into ground coffee to grind. This is the filter. We pour
					the coffee into the filter. Perfect amount. This is called a tamper. And this is called tamping
					espresso, but that's not a word that you will ever use. I didn't know that word myself until I
					started learning a little bit about espresso when I bought this machine. Really, all you're doing is
					pushing the espresso down to make it tight. Put it in here.<br>
					See how it's pressed down. Pressed down.
					Turn the power on. We turn it on. Takes a second to get ready.
					because we speak Spanish and English all day back and forth. What that means for you guys who do not
					speak Spanish, old school. Now, we would say old school or old-fashioned, meaning doing something
					the way they did it a long time ago. This, for example, could be old school because now a lot of
					people use an electric grinder. I thought it was cool to do it the old school way, like my wife
					said. All right, guys. Now we brew the espresso.<br>
					Brewing is a word that is used a lot for coffee. You brew coffee. When you're making the coffee, you
					could say you are brewing it.<br>
					 So guys, my wife said that's it. This is actually a double shot, meaning there's two. And
					the thing is espresso is very strong. It's a very strong coffee. So they make it like this. Just a
					little bit. This little part on top they call the crema. The crema. And what that is is the oils and
					bubbles from the pressure of the water through the machine. Yeah. It's just a little bit and it's
					very strong. That's why the American soldiers put water in it. And like I said in the other video,
					that's how my favorite drink, the Americano, got its name. Guys, if there's any Italians watching,
					tell me, how did I do? Did I make a good cup of espresso?<br>
					All right, let's go fish. What are you doing on work? All right, guys. So, we're going fishing. We
					walk out the door. I always lock the door behind me.<br>
					And I forgot I forgot the keys to the house, inside the house. So, I had to find a way to get in.
					Luckily, this window was not locked. So, now I have to climb in through the window and get keys.
					See you guys in a little bit.
					Baby, you need some sunscreen.<br>
					So, like super sunny.
					Okay, guys. Put some sunscreen. I don't have sunscreen, baby.
					My wife always says, "Put sunscreen." You need sunscreen. I don't because I have my awesome hat that
					I got in Colombia. This is going to protect me from the sun. Okay, guys. I'm about to catch a fish
					and show you guys. I know I'm going to catch a fish. Wife, do you believe I'm going to catch a fish?
					Yes.<br>
					my wife believes in. So guys, first let me just say it does not matter if you like fishing or not.
					This is going to be a great video full of new vocabulary and we're going to have some fun. All
					right, guys. Let me show you the stuff you need to go fishing in this style. Anyway, this is called
					a fishing rod or a fishing pole. This part right here, this part is the reel because you reel in the
					fish. To reel in means you are pulling it towards you.<br>
					This is called a hook.
					A fishing hook. And this will catch the fish and we will reel them in.
					Let me set up the hook. So this is the fishing line. Okay. Fishing line.
					You have to tie to tie your hook on. And we are going to tie a fisherman's knot.
					That is a knot.<br>
					That is a fisherman's knot.
					That is not going anywhere. All right, guys. Let me give a special shout out to a longtime
					subscriber in Colombia, John.<br>
					You've been asking for this video for years. I hope you like this and I'm going to dedicate the
					first fish that I catch to you, buddy. All right, I'm going to show you how we catch fish here in
					the US. All right, we have our hook on. Now, we need a weight. A weight, something heavy to make the
					hook go down to the bottom in the water. These are fishing weights.<br>
					So, you put your weights on the line like that. Okay, this guy's technically the real word for this
					is a float. A float because it floats on the top of the water. But most people will call this a
					bobber. A bobber because it bobs up and down. Bobbing up and down. Now, you can move it up or down,
					and that depends on how deep the water you're fishing in is. This place is not very deep, so we're
					not going to put it very deep. Before I add the last thing to our setup, let me explain to you guys
					something I do not like. Here in the United States here, you need a license to fish. Okay? The
					government says that I have to give them money to buy this license or I cannot go fish. The
					government did not make these fish.<br>
					Is that right, wife? Is it right that they make me pay for that? I don't think so. No, we don't
					think so. Say no, baby.
					No, no. My wife does not think it's right. Tell me if any of you guys like to fish in your country.
					Do they make you buy a license before you can fish?<br>
					All right, guys. We have our setup.
					We're ready to go. We need one more thing. Bait.<br>
					Bait is what you use to bait. To bait the fish. Okay. Bait is something that looks good that they
					want to eat. So they come, they bite it, and then the hook gets caught in their mouth and we can
					pull them in and then we can eat them. We're not going to eat the fish today, guys. We're just
					making this video and having some fun. So, we are going to use a bait that the fish here love worms.
					My wife loves worms.<br>
					Oh, that's a worm, guys. This is called a red worm. And fish love.
					Fish love these guys.
					So, we put him on the hook and I'm ready to catch a fish. Okay, guys. When you throw your your bait
					out there, the verb we use for that is called to cast. To cast. So, I'm going to cast my bait out
					there. This is a brand new reel. I've never used it, so I don't know if it's going to be good or
					not. Might take me a little bit of time to get used to it, but I'm going to cast it out there. So,
					it looks like there may be fish right here. So, I'm going to do just a little cast.
					Let's see.<br>
					Now, you see the bobber out there.
					That's so far away. I swear.
					All right.
					Now, if a fish is trying to eat my bait, we'll see that bouncing up and down.<br>
					Didn't catch anything over here. We're going to go try on the other side. One little piece of
					vocabulary I want to give you guys is a pond. So, a pond is like a small lake. Okay, this is a pond.
					Uh, another thing I want to just share with you guys is that this is my first time fishing in over 2
					years. I used to fish all the time with a very good friend of mine, but he died 2 years ago, and I
					have not been fishing since. It felt weird to go without him. So, you guys are coming with me on my
					first fishing trip without my buddy Ernie.<br>
					Rest in peace, buddy.
					Okay, guys. We're going to try again. We moved to another spot. My wife said she was super super
					hot, so I had to find her some shade. Shade is when you have trees that block the sun and they cause
					a shadow and it's much cooler over here.<br>
					So, this way my wife won't have to say how hot she is every 5 minutes. Just kidding, guys.
					and maybe we'll catch something over in this different spot. So, I will talk to you guys when I have
					a fish and I will catch a fish. So, guys, something I want to start doing in these videos now that
					the channel is growing and growing, we're getting subscribers from all around the world. And you
					guys say, "Hey, I'm from this country. I'm from this country." To be honest, guys, a lot of these
					countries I know nothing about.<br>
					I don't know anything about your country. So, I'm going to start making a little part in each one of
					these videos where I learn something about one of your guys's countries. That way, you guys can
					learn about the life here. I can share my life with you guys, but I also want to learn about the
					people who are watching my videos. So, today I am going to learn a little bit a few interesting
					facts about the country.<br>
					Oman. Let's learn a little bit about the country. I'm going to guess it's pronounced Oman. One thing
					that I see here that is very interesting is that there's a strong tradition of horsemanship, which
					means that riding horses is very popular there. For that reason, I think my wife would like to learn
					a little bit about this country.<br>
					She loves riding horses, too. Another thing that strikes me as very interesting is that it is one of
					the safest countries in the world. Super cool, guys. Which makes me think, hm, maybe one day a trip
					to Oman. Now, here's one that is strange for me. It says that Mountain Dew, the the drink Mountain
					Dew is very popular there. I am not a fan of Mountain Dew. It's pretty popular here in the US, but
					it surprises me that it's popular in an Arab country that I assume is Muslim. That's sounds strange
					to me. I wonder how Mountain Dew became the popular drink there. So if you guys are from Oman, tell
					me, do you like to drink Mountain Dew? Is that a true fact? And the last interesting fact that we
					are going to learn today about Oman is that Oman is one of only 27 countries in the whole world that
					does not have trains. There's only 27 countries in the whole world that do not have rails and
					trains, and Oman is one of them. All right, guys. That was just me learning a little bit about you
					guys.<br>
					I really appreciate all the new viewers, all the awesome comments. I love when you guys tell me
					where you're from because like I said before, my world gets bigger every time I learn about a new
					place. All right. So, thank you guys so much for being here with me.
					Let's get back to fishing.<br>
					Okay, guys. We're going to try one last spot. This looks like a good one. We've got this big tree
					here for shade. My wife said she was hot, so I find her shade. Now, she's hungry. So, we have to I
					have to catch a fish now. Now, guys, because my wife gets mean when she's hungry. She's going to
					fight me. So, I have to catch a fish now. She said she doesn't like fishing anymore.
					Wow. Oh, yeah. Guys, really?<br>
					Oh. All right, guys. This is a beautiful fish. This is called a blue gill. Let me see. You have to
					be careful where you grab them because this is very sharp and it can stab you. So, you grab it like
					this.<br>
					Oh, wow.
					So, guys, it's called a blue gill.
					Didn't hurt him at all. He's going to be fine when I put him back. See all the beautiful blue
					colors? This part is called his gills.<br>
					Beautiful fish. Blue gill cuz the beautiful blue colors. This is just a small one, but this was all
					we could catch today. John and Columbia, it's a little fish. I'm sorry I couldn't catch you a big
					one. That's a bluegill.
					This one's for you.
					He's going home.
					All right, guys.<br>
					My wife didn't think I was going to catch one. I know. But we got one. Maybe we'll try going fishing
					again at a better time because it's too late in the day right now. They're not biting, but we caught
					one. Maybe we should stay here, baby, and catch some more. No. All right, guys. I got to go feed
					this little wife of mine. She's hungry. Thank you guys for watching, for going on this adventure
					with me. First time I've been fishing in years, and I enjoyed it.<br>
					Thank you for watching. See you guys soon.
