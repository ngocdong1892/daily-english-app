					wow I'm so proud of you that you've been working so hard this week or I'm so proud of you that
					you've achieved your goals and another way that you can speak this language is to tell them thank
					you tell them thank you for all of the things that they do for you thank you so much for always
					cleaning the house for us thank you for helping take care of the kids thank you for always making a
					delicious dinner thank you I appreciate you the second love language hacks of service so one way
					that you can speak this love language is you can do something for your partner that they usually do
					for example your wife always cleans the house she does the dishes well tonight after dinner you can
					clean the dishes for her okay and if this is her love language she's going to appreciate that very
					very much okay other example your partner they worked very hard today okay and they're sore their
					body hurts okay ow my back hurts baby I worked so hard today you can give them a massage okay
					somebody who worked very hard and who speaks the language Actos de cervicio they are going to
					appreciate very much a massage after a hard day the third love language regalos gifts a thoughtful
					gift a thoughtful gift does not have to be something very big or expensive Grande or costos but it
					could be something small that shows your partner that you were thinking about them because really
					it's not the gift no es el regalo it is the thought behind it that makes these people feel special
					who speak this love language for example if your girlfriend to Novia if she loves a certain author
					un outdoor okay if she loves an author and you buy her a book that was written by that author she's
					going to love it she's going to love it because you're speaking her love language okay she's going
					to know that you were thinking about her okay ladies if your boyfriend or your husband he loves uh
					uh soccer team when he keep all the football and you see a hat okay with his team on it and you buy
					him that hat and you say baby I was thinking about you I saw this I know you love this team here I
					got this for you he's gonna fall in love with you again so it doesn't have to be big but if you
					really think about it they're going to appreciate it the fourth love language quality time so people
					who speak the love language they speak the love language of quality time Tiempo de calidad they want
					to share they want to share just a little bit of special time with you okay so some things you can
					do to speak this love language and share some quality time with your partner you can play a sport
					with them that they love my girlfriend and I oh me prometida no es mi novia um we love to play
					tennis okay we love to go play tennis we'll go play for an hour it's great quality time that we
					spend together okay it could be sharing a hobby that you really enjoy or simply sit down and talk
					about the important things that are going on in both of your lives okay A lot of times we do not
					talk about what's going on in our heads all right but it's very important to do so especially if
					your partner speaks the love language of quality time numero Cinco number five the fifth love
					language physical physical touch there are many things many things that can be considered physical
					touch holding hands holding hands when you're walking down the street that could be physical touch a
					little kiss on the forehead okay or a little kiss on the hand okay or touching their face okay and
					telling them how handsome or beautiful they look today or in English we say playing footsies okay
					and this means when you touch your feet okay if you go to a restaurant and you guys are touching
					your feet and legs together under the table we call that in English playing footsies and even making
					love okay to make love I said amor that is definitely okay physical and the language the love
					language of physical touch okay now for the people who speak who speak this love language a hug a
					hug when you are very busy when you're doing all these things when you're very busy and you stop you
					stop and you take the time to give them a hug to give them a quick kiss before you go to work it can
					mean a whole lot to them it can mean a whole lot to them and it can show them that you are thinking
					about them and that you are trying to speak their love language okay so this book was very
					interesting for me to think about when I read it I learned a lot from this book and I learned to
					stop to stop and think okay so maybe maybe the things that are important to me are not as important
					to my girlfriend and maybe the things that are so important to her are not so important to me but we
					both have to stop and think and try to speak the other one's love language okay if you take the time
					I promise you guys less prometo if you stop and you take the time to try and think about the love
					language of your partner and you try your best to speak it it is going to make your relationship a
					lot more successful a lot more satisfying and a lot more loving foreign
