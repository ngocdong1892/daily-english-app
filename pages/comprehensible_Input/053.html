					in  all right guys today today I am going to talk about how you how you can use
					comprehensible input to learn or improve your English but first what is comprehensible input well
					comprehensible input is a concept in language acquisition Theory particularly associated with Steven
					crash's input hypothesis it refers to language input that Learners can understand despite
					encountering some new language features this means the input should be slightly above the language
					learner's current level providing Opportunities For Learning Without causing excessive confusion
					comprehensible input is ental IAL for Effective language learning as it allows Learners to acquire
					language naturally through exposure and understanding rather than explicit instruction alone that is
					comprehensible input so how can we use comprehensible input to learn a new language well first step
					to find content that is comprehensible to you if you are a beginner if you are starting to learn
					English from zero okay you do not know any English in my opinion the best thing that you can do is
					find comprehensible input videos made especially for beginner language Learners like the ones that
					you can find in my beginner playlist these videos use pictures and I talk with my hands to make the
					English comprehensible to you so I recommend that you go and check it out other op options are books
					for children like this and you can even find books that have English and Spanish okay things like
					this are very useful when you are first starting out some people also recommend watching cartoons
					that are designed for young children my comprehensible input Mentor recommends watching Peppa Pig
					now if you have a intermediate level of English you are going to need to find some content that is
					more difficult but you are still not at the level where you will be able to understand shows or
					movies that are made for native speakers this is my specialty and on my intermediate playlist you
					will find hours hours of content made about every theme that you could possibly imagine where I
					speak slowly and clearly so that intermediate English Learners can understand what I'm saying and
					begin to truly acquire my language and and I really love to make videos where you can learn English
					but also valuable life lessons so I really think that this playlist is super valuable for an
					Intermediate Language learner also at this level there are a lot of great podcasts that you could
					find made just for intermediate English Learners and you could even start to read a little bit more
					difficult content such as books written for young readers comic books or books that are made
					specifically for language Learners such as this book that was written by famous polyglot o Richards
					shout out to olly and as soon as content like that starts to become too easy for you it is time to
					search out more advanced content and this is where the fun starts now you can watch shows on Netflix
					with subtitles movies of comedy horror science fiction and you can even start to read novels written
					by your favorite authors but in English step number two now that you found content that is
					comprehensible and probably even more important enjoyable it is time to start consuming it every day
					when I first found out about comprehensible input it was because I discovered a YouTube channel
					called Dreaming Spanish when I first found dreaming Spanish I spent hours watching the videos
					sometimes two or 3 hours a day now you don't have to be as obsessed as I was but I do recommend that
					you spend at least one hour a day with your target language in order to improve and the most
					important part of this step is that you enjoy the process it should not feel like you are studying
					it should feel like you are having fun and step number three as you begin to improve and raise your
					level of your target language you need to start making this language a part of your life make
					friends who speak the language go to events in the language consume your entertainment in the
					language for example I go to church in Spanish with my wife I've went to concerts in Spanish Carlos
					vivz I have friends who speak Spanish and the best comprehensible input that I have ever received in
					my life was going on a date with a beautiful woman who did not speak English and I ended up marrying
					that woman so now I get comprehensible input every day of my life now the truth is you do not have
					to marry somebody in order to learn a language with comprehensible input but you do have to make it
					a part of your life so what are you waiting for go watch some input
