					hey everybody today I am going to speak in a nice intermediate English like this a nice and slow
					clear English that you can use as comprehensible as input input compri to improve your listening
					skills in my native language English so what what are we going to talk about today today I am going
					to learn too you are going to learn English but I am going to learn about how some things work Kom
					funion I'm going to learn about some things the way that they work that I have no idea but we're
					going to learn together okay let me tell you the things that I am going to talk about these are a
					couple of things that I want to learn about okay and we're going to figure it out together we're
					going to ask chat GPT because chat GPT okay guys wind fento where does it come from where does wind
					come from right do you know where wind comes from if you know where wind comes from tell me in the
					comments okay second mirrors esos who makes mirrors how does that happen because glass is clear it's
					clar right how do they make mirrors to where they reflect to where you can see yourself maybe I'm
					just tun okay maybe I'm a big dummy and you you guys already know all of this but I do not have any
					clue no tangoa how mirrors work so that is another one we are going to find out the third that we
					are going to find out the third thing that I don't know why we do it how it works how it helps
					something called leap year every 4 years in the month of February we add an extra day February 29th
					because normally there are only 28 days in February but every 4 years we add one extra day and we
					call it leap year so I want to find out why do we do that how does it help anybody where did it come
					from we will ask chat GPT and the last one is something about languages okay because this is a
					language channel so last one I think is pretty interesting it is how did the language Latin become
					so many different languages because the romance languages all come from Latin so we've got French uh
					Portuguese Spanish Italian Romanian and a couple other ones how did all of those different languages
					come from Latin that's what we're going to figure out last all right guys we've got chat GPT let's
					get some answers chat GPT explain to me in very simple terms where does wind come from okay guys
					this is what chat GPT says let's see if we can understand it wind happens because the sun heats the
					Earth unevenly some places get warmer than others which makes the air there lighter and Rise cooler
					air which is heavier Mas which is heavier moves in to take its place this movement of air from from
					one place to another is what we call wind okay guys you know what I thought that it had something to
					do with gravity because you know I've heard that the moon somehow affects waves oress in the ocean
					so I thought maybe it had something to do with the gravity between perhaps the Moon and Earth but I
					did not think that it would be when air gets warmer and Rises and cold air pushes it down to take
					its place all right guys did you know that one did you know that one or are you as surprised as I am
					okay guys let's figure out mirrors where do they come from how are they made what's up with mirrors
					chat GPT how are mirrors made where were they invented what are they made out of okay guys how
					mirrors are made let's see if we can understand this mirrors are usually made by taking a flat piece
					of glass and coating one side with a thin layer of metal like aluminum or silver this metal layer
					reflects the light creating the shiny surface the metal is protected with a special paint or backing
					to keep it from getting damaged okay guys so they take glass and they put a small layer of aluminum
					or silver Plata and that is what reflects the light H did you know that there was a thin piece of
					metal inside glass or inside mirrors guys maybe this is common sense and I am the only one that did
					not know this but I had no idea where were mirrors invented the first mirrors were made in ancient
					times ancient times about six th000 years ago in places like Mesopotamia and Egypt those Egyptians
					bistos these were polished stones or metals like bronze glass mirrors with metal backing were
					invented much later in ancient Rome okay so they have been using mirrors for 6,000 years so I guess
					the lesson of that is that humans have always been narcissists not n narcissist people have been
					narcissists for 6,000 years and then it says modern mirrors are made of glass which provides a
					smooth and flat surface and the reflective Metal Coating usually aluminum or silver to reflect the
					light loose okay guys I learned something there next let's figure out what's up with leap day what's
					going on there chat GPT tell me what is Leap Day used for why do we do it every 4 years and how is
					it beneficial okay guys it gave me a long list of stuff so I think we're about to learn a lot about
					Leap Day leap day which happens on February 29th every 4 years is used to keep our calendar
					calendario in sync with the Earth's orbit around the Sun okay the Earth's orbit around the sun
					here's why it's important and how it works why do we have leap day the Earth's year is not exactly
					365 days the Earth takes about 365.25 days to orbit the Sun so that extra 6 hours adds up over time
					without leap day our calendar would drift drift means to move or like shift guys by about 6 hours
					each year in 100 years we would be about 25 days off meaning that Seasons would slowly shift why
					every 4 years adding an extra day every 4 years corrects the drift and keeps the calendar aligned
					with Earth's orbit how is it beneficial it ensures that Seasons like spring summer fall and winter
					they occur at the same time each year Agricultural and cultural accuracy it helps farmers and
					Society plan events based on seasonal patterns okay guys let me explain a little bit about that last
					part a little more simpler terms so it helps the farmers Grand Heros now a lot of you guys I know I
					just came back from Colombia I know that in Colombia it's beautiful all year round right most places
					and the the weather doesn't change very much but here there's snow NE right now there's snow outside
					so our Farmers they cannot grow their corn or their soybeans or their potatoes they can't grow those
					when there snow so they need to know when it's going to get cold and when it's going to be warm so
					they can plant their crops crops is a word that we use to describe anything that a farmer is growing
					that's their crops their crops can be corn can be potatoes can be carrots whatever whatever a farmer
					is growing he can call his crops okay so that's interesting so our calendar has 365 days but really
					it takes 365 days plus 6 hours to go around the earth for that reason every 4 years they add an
					extra 24 hours to make up for that extra extra 6 hours per year guys I don't know about you but I'm
					feeling a lot smarter just from learning this stuff and next time somebody's like why do we even do
					leap dat it's dumb you are is too we need it we need it all right guys now for the last one how the
					the language of Latin split into so many different languages let's figure that one out so we can be
					very smart who know how did the Latin language split into so many other languages the romance
					languages give me a detailed explanation okay guys it gave us a whole lot so let's see we'll see
					what we can learn here the Latin language split into the romance languages like Spanish French
					Italian Portuguese and Romanian I knew all those through a gradual process that unfolded over
					centuries over hundreds of years here's how it happened number one the Roman empire spread Latin as
					the Roman Empire expanded it expanded across Europe North Africa and parts of the Middle East Latin
					became the dominant language to the fall of the Roman Empire the fragmentation of the Roman Empire
					after Rome fell it fell communication and unity among its territories broke down isolation isolation
					sometimes I can't even speak English guys regions became more isolated from one another and local
					versions of Latin became began to develop independently okay so once guys this whole area was the
					Roman Empire all right and for that and they were all writing their books and making their laws in
					the same form of Latin but when the Empire split up all these different places were no longer one
					country they were individual territories okay and in each one of these territories a new culture
					started to develop and new slaying New Uses of the language started to develop in different ways
					because they were no longer communicating all together as one in fluence of local languages and
					cultures pre-roman languages meaning the languages that already existed in these parts before those
					big mean Romans came and took everything over local languages like Iberian and Spain mixed with
					Latin creating different dialects later Germanic invasions Germanic tribes like the Franks and
					Visigoths introduced new vocabulary and grammar also geography natural barriers like mountains and
					rivers isolated communities which accelerated the differences in the languages it says by the 9th
					century Regional dialects of Latin had diverg to diverge to split up had diverg so much that people
					from different areas could barely understand each other they could barely understand each other well
					no they could no longer understand each other wow over time these dialects evolved into separate
					languages each with its own grammar vocabulary and pronunciation so guys basically put in simple
					terms Latin was spoken over a huge huge area because the Romans tried to conquer the world okay and
					they actually did a pretty good job because there was a whole lot of territory within the Roman
					Empire but when the Roman Empire fell and broke into different pieces each one of these separate
					territories was no longer underneath the same Empire okay they didn't have those same uh Roman guys
					giving them laws in the same Roman dialect okay they started to make their own cultures and that
					started to form the separate languages that we now know as French Spanish Italian Portuguese and
					Romanian I learned a lot guys I hope you did too thank you for joining me
