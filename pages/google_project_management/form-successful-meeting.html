				<p id="1cf468a0-53d4-817d-8c2a-e0a7bf4d6556" class="">In this video, you’ll learn how to organize and
					facilitate effective team meetings that will lead to a successful project.<br />While the size,
					purpose,
					and format of meetings may differ, effective meetings always have the following elements in
					common.<br />They are structured, intentional, collaborative, and inclusive.<br />Let’s study these
					elements in more detail.<br />First, effective meetings are structured.<br />This means they start
					and
					end on time.<br />The attendees have been carefully selected.<br />The meeting topics are
					prioritized.<br />And the designated note taker has been assigned.<br />Managing the meeting time
					and
					audience lets participants know that they’re valued and appreciated.<br />Remember that everyone’s
					time
					is valuable.<br />If someone’s presence is unnecessary, you don’t need to invite them to the
					meeting.<br />Maybe you can share the notes.<br />Include people who can contribute to the
					discussion
					and anyone who will be directly affected by the topics discussed.<br />Structured meetings also have
					an
					agenda with prioritized topics.<br />So the most important items are given appropriate
					attention.<br />It’s good to think about and set expectations for how long you expect the group to
					spend
					on a given topic.<br />This is defined as timeboxing, which just means you’re setting a time limit
					for
					discussion.<br />In a timebox, you give each topic a buffer of a few minutes to make sure you’re not
					over packing your agenda.<br />Keep the meeting time in mind.<br />And make sure you scheduled
					enough
					time for the topic you need to cover.<br />If there are several topics you need to address, consider
					scheduling a few shorter meetings with just one or two topics as their focus.<br />After your first
					few
					team meetings, think about the pacing to know if you need to be more generous with the time given to
					each topic or if the group has time for a little more.<br />If you get through your topics before
					your
					time is up, don’t be afraid to call a meeting early.<br />Everybody loves having their time
					back.<br />Finally, a structured meeting should have a designated note taker, so you or anyone else
					can
					refer to the meeting notes later and find out what was discussed.<br />The note taker could be or
					another meeting attendee.<br />For this reason, be clear about how, when, and to whom the meeting’s
					outcomes are shared.<br />Again, this all depends on the type of meeting you’re having and who is
					attending.<br />The next point to consider is that effective meetings are also
					intentional.<br />This
					means they have a clearly-stated purpose and expectations, which should be in the meeting agenda as
					well
					as the meeting invite, so everyone understands why they’re attending.<br />The agenda needs to set
					clear
					expectations for what needs to occur before and during a meeting.<br />It helps attendees prepare,
					keeps
					everyone focused on the right topics, and clarifies meeting expectations and goals.<br />The purpose
					of
					your meeting might be to make a decision, assign tasks, propose/invent an idea, or something
					else.<br />Your meeting’s purpose or goal describes the reason you’re meeting and what you’d like to
					achieve.<br />A well-designed agenda increases the group’s ability to address problems and prevents
					wasting time.<br />For example, you may be reviewing last month’s business sales and setting goals
					for
					the next month.<br />Maybe your group needs to choose coordinators for an upcoming event.<br />Or
					your
					goal could be to have your supervisor prioritize a list of tasks.<br />The purpose might change from
					meeting to meeting.<br />Or it could stay the same.<br />If input is needed by attendees, be sure to
					send any pre-reading materials in advance of the meeting, so that everyone shows up prepared to
					participate.<br />Depending on the purpose, meetings can be formal or informal, have as few as two
					or
					three group members, or have hundreds of attendees.<br />Whatever it is, make sure you state a
					clear,
					thoughtful purpose and strive to achieve that purpose by the end of the allotted time.<br />Another
					element of effective meetings is encouraging a collaborative environment.<br />Collaboration is when
					people work together to produce or create something.<br />There are lots of ways to make your
					meetings
					collaborative, even if the purpose is for one person to share important information with the rest of
					the
					group.<br />One easy way to do this is to be sure the agenda isn’t just full of presentations, where
					participants are talked at.<br />Be sure the agenda is clear about the objectives of the
					session.<br />Will a decision be made?<br />Or is the session for information and
					discussion?<br />Second, have a digital shared meeting document and encourage participants to write
					any
					comments or thoughts directly in the document.<br />But more importantly, remind them that the notes
					will be shared.<br />This encourages active listening and participation in real time during the
					meeting.<br />Last, it’s important to respect and embrace each individual’s preferred communication
					style, even in meetings, especially in collaborative meetings.<br />Let folks know they’re welcome
					to
					respond verbally, through the chat, in the meeting notes, or in any other format you’d like to
					include.<br />The final element of an effective meeting is that it’s inclusive.<br />Inclusivity is
					the
					practice or policy of including people who might otherwise be excluded or marginalized.<br />When
					it’s
					done well, inclusion leads to excellent collaboration ensuring that every participant’s
					contributions
					are valued.<br />As a project manager, you play a critical role in ensuring that meeting attendees
					feel
					supported and included.<br />So offering additional resources for ways to participate is
					helpful.<br />For both in-person and virtual meetings, consider appointing a meeting moderator or
					facilitator.<br />This person will guide the meeting and help participants ask questions in real
					time,
					while someone else is presenting.<br />This way, the presenter can stay focused on their topic while
					the
					moderator pays attention to the participants and can help guide participants on when they can chime
					in.<br />It’s also a good idea to leave space in the meeting for participants who have been
					quiet.<br />At the close of a topic or before the meeting ends, you might consider going around the
					room
					once in a while and asking each person to comment on a particular issue or question.<br />I like to
					call
					this final flight check, before everyone takes off and goes their separate ways.<br />A key
					component of
					inclusivity is ensuring that your meetings and presentations are accessible.<br />You’ll find more
					information on this in the course resources.<br />Another thing to consider is the level of internet
					access when conducting virtual meetings.<br />For those without strong internet access, provide a
					phone
					dial in option.<br />Most online meeting tools, including Google Meet and Zoom, have this
					option.<br />Let participants know it’s OK to turn off their cameras if they need to improve the
					connection or adjust the video quality.<br />Focusing on inclusion helps build a sense of belonging
					and
					serves as a reminder that we live in a world with many different kinds of people.<br />Creating a
					meeting space where people of different views, backgrounds, and experiences can do their best work
					and
					be there for one another is key.<br />These tips aren’t exhaustive by any means.<br />But hopefully,
					they can be useful to start empowering others to meaningfully join in and contribute.<br />When done
					right, meetings can be incredibly useful communication tools.<br />That’s why it’s important to be
					purposeful when designing meetings that are structured, intentional, collaborative, and
					inclusive.<br />This will earn you a reputation for writing efficient, inclusive, successful
					meetings
					where everyone feels appreciated, which is great for your project and your career.<br /></p>
