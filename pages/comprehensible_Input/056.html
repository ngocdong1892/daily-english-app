					Emma  is okay okay  thank you so I'm from Washington State from right outside of
					Seattle the cap not the capital but the main city so from wide outside of Seattle and Kyle where are
					you from so I'm from a state called Indiana okay the Northwest part of Indiana and a small city
					called Hobart um not a big city that people from other countries would know but that's where I'm
					from we're pretty close to Chicago and the whole world knows about Chicago okay Kyle so what is your
					state known for okay so Indiana uh kind of has two two different sides to it it has a very
					industrial side and then kind of an agricultural side where we we grow a lot of corn here a lot of
					soybeans super fun stuff and then we have an industrial side where we we make a lot of Steel here in
					Indiana the the company that I actually work for is the biggest steel producer in the United States
					so we make a ton of Steel for cars for buildings uh that's a that's a big thing here in Indiana and
					it's a good thing because it pays well a lot of people can feed their families and it has a bad side
					too because you go to the beach trying to have a beautiful day and you look out over the lake and
					over here you see big buildings smoking making steel and it's a little bit ugly right so the
					pollution is a problem right yeah yeah industry brings money but it brings pollution right so I know
					oops technical difficulties okay we're back yeah yeah okay so uh what do you think when you think
					about your hometown yeah when I think of my Washington I say Seattle but I live really on the
					outside of Seattle so I think of the suburbs you know I just think of these little houses very calm
					areas but when I think of Seattle I think of big city I think of skyscrapers the space needles so
					maybe all of you know that monument in Seattle the Space Needle if not look it up so it's this
					beautiful place monument in Seattle that's really cool very touristic place and just once yeah one
					of The Monuments that Seattle is known for and when I think of Washington as a whole I think of
					natural Paradise we have so much nature there really so much Forest so Washington is the home to a
					few national parks one of the biggest ones is the Olympic National Park so there we have the whole
					rainforest which is the biggest rainforest in the United States so that's really awesome and it's
					beautiful and yes we have Beach there we have many lakes the whole state is on the coast so
					Washington is in the state of the Pacific Northwest in the region I should say of the Pacific
					Northwest which is part of Oregon Washington Canada and then that's right above California so it
					goes California Oregon and Washington so I'm really from a beautiful region the west coast is
					gorgeous so you were you were talking about the beautiful nature where you grew up and that that
					sounds great sounds super peaceful uh when I think about nature in Indiana we we do have some
					beautiful things here too it's not all one giant uh steel factory with smoke and uh corn and stuff
					so we actually have a lake that's 10 minutes away from where I live it's called Lake Michigan and
					Lake Michigan is one of the Great Lakes and um these lakes here are as big as a sea so they're
					bigger than some seas in other countries wow so yeah you it's it's huge there's beaches on it and in
					the summer it's actually pretty beautiful uh we have sand dunes where you could hike and there
					there's a lot of places in Indiana where it's actually really really natural uh really clean
					unpolluted and just nice places to go do photography or you know go spend some time with your
					friends or family and uh that that's what I think about when I think about the nature in Indiana is
					sand dunes beautiful Forest we don't have an ocean but we have Lake Michigan yeah hey that's
					something and I'm sure it's beautiful there mm-hmm if we're talking about what your region is famous
					for is there something in particular that comes to mind so keeping with the corn that we grow here
					uh there's a famous brand of popcorn Orville Redenbacher so I'm pretty sure popcorn was pretty much
					invented here so that's our claim to fame we nobody does corn like we do corn you know that's a lot
					that's a lot of Amazon like the huge giant International giant that's taking over the world so think
					of it what you will a lot of people are for a lot of people are against I'm not saying anything I'm
					just saying Amazon's based in Seattle not Google but Microsoft's based in Seattle so it's very Tech
					techie we have this very Tech culture it's very modern too because it's probably one of the last
					colonized states in the U.S over to the West so it's very modern and so yeah we have lots of tech
					there lots of startups big startup culture okay so you know you've got the big Tech you've got the
					beautiful nature would you say everything is good there you guys have your uh your things that are
					less than perfect as well yeah we have things that are less than perfect just like any place so we
					can't talk about the US the United States without talking about the reality and what's really
					happening and in Seattle what we have is a lot of gentrification first of all so if you for those of
					you who don't know what gentrification is it happens everywhere and it's when money or rich people
					move into the City and they kind of pull they push locals out of the city not purposefully it
					happens right because it's a tech central people want to be there I said Amazon's there they're
					bringing in lots of workers nothing against them but we do have this push to Poverty so when you
					push people out of their homes you push people onto the streets so that's real that's the reality
					and we have a lot of homelessness in the U.S a lot and problems with drug usage and problems with
					gun violence and I don't want to sit here and act like everything's perfect because the US is not a
					Hollywood movie and I have had family members who have been involved or have seen gun violence
					because of this culture in the U.S so I want to be very outspoken and say that we need to have
					reform and we need to take care of the situation because we are hurting each other really and we
					can't act like everything's perfect I agree it's uh it's a problem with the the mindset as a whole
					of the officials uh you know the legislation but also our we have to take responsibility as uh as a
					as a people you know uh Society we glorify violence singing about hurting one another you know we
					need to start projecting positivity and love rather than talking about hurting each other and you
					know stealing from each other and yeah uh I would say we deal with a lot of that as well drugs
					poverty a lot of people losing their homes or you know just not having money to eat not having clean
					clothes for their children and like I said I'm real close to Chicago uh if I'm not mistaken Chicago
					is the gun Capital the gun violence capital of the U.S uh people are killed here every weekend sadly
					and it just never changes nothing changes you hear about it every weekend and they they speak about
					it so casually yeah because that becomes people's reality people get used to that I was just talking
					to my brother the other day who's living in in the U.S still and recently in my neighborhood we had
					an incident with gun violence and my brother said hey we're used to this I'm used to hearing
					gunshots and we're talking about a middle class neighborhood of families yeah so none of this is
					going to change with that reform and as you said without a mindset change so we don't want to focus
					on too much negative but we understand that we need to talk about the reality of what's happening in
					the U.S so I'm just glad that we can share what's happening and that not all of us are like boom
					boom let's go to the streets you know we're not all supporters of this we just need support from the
					government we need people to really make change you know and you know what I would I would argue
					that uh you and myself and other people who are putting out positive content Good Vibes having a
					mission and trying to help other people I would argue that that's the change we need everybody needs
					to be focusing on positivity and you know trying to share the good things rather than trying to take
					away what someone else has or hate someone else try to bridge the gap between people right
					absolutely I think it's necessary to acknowledge these realities and as you said put out positive
					and beneficial content right so let's get to that I know one thing that you have in your area and
					this is all over the U.S but also in my area it's a lot of diversity of cultures a lot of diversity
					and that's one of the things that I love about the US say what you will about the us but we have
					diversity like you will find people from every country in the world in the US building a life and
					building a community looking for that American Dream right so that's our charm that's really what we
					have and that's one of my favorite things like you go to Seattle you can see Korean food Chinese
					food Vietnamese food you can find Mexican food Cuban food I mean food from everywhere you just have
					such a rich culture and that's beautiful I agree completely uh the town where I actually live is not
					like Chicago you know where there's such diversity as in like Korean Vietnamese we have a ton of uh
					Latinos here and you could get the most authentic Mexican food on every street in my my city There
					is seriously probably 15 Mexican restaurants that I could walk to every one of them is so good it's
					got you know filled with people making the food they grew up on delicious real stuff and uh that's
					that's a beautiful thing to me too and I never have trouble finding someone to practice my Spanish
					with here find a lot of like Latino products we do yeah you could go in there and get the uh the
					Abuelita chocolate or yeah super good fresh vegetables and uh awesome little you know Carnitas and
					the the good cuts of meat for making awesome tacos or stuff like that chicharron yeah there's salt
					Mexican stores around here yeah absolutely I don't know about in your region but one thing that we
					have a lot in the Pacific Northwest is like native communities and Indigenous communities so Native
					Americans you know who the original people from this land historically so they have tons of of
					property there and you know they there's a lot of native reservations which is kind of controversial
					but at the end of the day they have their presence and they have their Community within the U.S so I
					know that because we're all the way to the west and we were like some of the last colonized lands we
					have a large very large native population there so what about you guys in your region so it's sad
					because Indiana is literally comes from the misconception that you know the people the indigenous
					people here were Indians so Indiana Indianapolis Indiana police is city of Indians wow yeah however
					sadly you're not going to find very many Native American people living here as you said I think they
					were so uh you know we we do have some uh some casinos here that are ran by Native Americans and uh
					but that's really the only place you're gonna find any type of Native American population here to my
					knowledge yeah right so we do have to put out there that we're not experts we might be missing out
					on something so yeah you know what we're going to find a lot in Washington is like a lot of native
					artwork like in Washington at least we have this culture of wood firewood why because it's like all
					forests we're built on a forest so what we have there is like a lot of native carvings of like just
					different figures in trunks like huge tree trunks they'll carve like little different animal figures
					and face figures and paint them so you can find like these beautiful woodwork beautiful native
					woodwork there so and different kinds of tribal artwork so that's very particular to that region as
					well and very rich in culture that's that's super cool and I I wish we had something like that uh
					but that's that's not what we're known for here um this is a really blue collar area Blue Collar
					meaning physical labor jobs you know we've got a lot of people uh working construction or like
					Paving streets stuff like that um that's kind of what you think of when you you come to my city
					you'll see a lot of people working hard trying to feed their families you know a lot of a lot of I
					would say there's a lot of good people here because you know sometimes when people don't come from a
					lot of money we we kind of learn to stick together and enjoy what we do have and I I think that's
					kind of a reason why I have some friends that are closer than brothers because we came up without
					having a whole lot so you know we we stick together and you just put three of us in a room with
					nothing no money no food no nothing we're gonna have a good time we know how to do that right and
					you learn how to survive when you learn how to hustle right like the US is totally known for that
					hustle mentality of like okay I have what I have I'm gonna make do with what I have and I'm gonna
					make it good so definitely of course in the suburbs of Washington it's the same mentality recently
					as I said in Seattle we have this modern tech tech this modern tech movement so that's cool too it's
					not necessary it's not physical work it's brain work you know we have people making Industries like
					huge companies so that's cool but I can definitely appreciate this kind of like middle class
					hard-working family person I think those are the people that are building that built our country at
					the end of the day and sustain our country you know yeah it's the it's the backbone of the country
					but you need both sides you need to keep advancing and you also need the people who are holding it
					up so that the others can do these jobs requiring the brains to make our future brighter great
					absolutely so I'm gonna throw a different question at you I'm very curious about this so I wonder if
					you have any kind of like fairy tales are folklore or kind of stories from your area okay that's
					that's that's a really good question I you know I love urban legends and stuff like that um there's
					a lot of urban legends by me there's a a road uh street that is haunted by me and uh you know
					there's supposed to be ghosts there we've got a lot of ghosts ghosts here in Indiana you know I've
					got a book that's uh called Haunted Indiana and it's all about the ghost stories and it's super
					interesting um I don't know that we have something that we're super known for like you know Bigfoot
					or a wolf man or anything like that but I think ghosts are super super popular here and there's tons
					if you if you type up haunted places near me there's so many here and another thing that is here in
					my city we have ghost hunting groups wait totally yeah very very popular ghost I grew up watching
					Ghost Hunters these crazy guys going into haunted houses at midnight with flashlights and all this
					technology hunting for ghosts that's crazy that's super funny so maybe one day I'll I'll reach out
					and try and uh do a video with them or something whatever you can imagine so what about you yeah you
					you kind of gave it away there we in the Washington Pacific Northwest region we have this kind of
					Legend of Bigfoot right because it's all forests so I don't even think people have gotten to the
					depths of the forest fair so with that comes these Legends and these kind of you know folklore about
					Bigfoot which is a Sasquatch this huge furry like I don't even know how we would classify him like a
					animal mixed with a man like a gorilla mixed with a man and yeah he has a family supposedly living
					in the forests of Washington state and Oregon so the Sasquatch came from from that region and also
					we have this kind of like the love for the Wolves you know because we have tons we used to have more
					of course they're going less and less they're decreasing but also we have like legends about wolves
					again Twilight this whole legend of wolves and vampires you find that there so that's kind of some
					of the folklore that we have related to Washington  okay yeah I love things like that I love
					I have a bigfoot shirt that's one of my favorites so yeah in Washington you'll find tons of like art
					with big big stickers Bigfoot stickers Bigfoot t-shirts so yeah that's super particular to that
					region as well yeah so if you want to talk about popular culture in Seattle we have tons of movies
					there we had Gray's Anatomy Twilight we had 50 Shades of Gray and also we've had some music bands so
					Kurt Cobain from Nirvana from Seattle not really from Seattle but from Washington State so the
					grunge movement in music was born in Seattle so pretty a city with a lot of history there modern
					history we could see yeah what about you any popular culture that's kind of important from your
					state okay so have you ever seen the Christmas movie A Christmas Story yeah that's supposed to take
					place like 10 minutes away from me in a city called Hammond Indiana cool so that we've got that here
					um that's the only a lot of things have happened in Chicago I know they film like part of
					Transformers there and you know there's been tons of movies taking place in Chicago but where I'm
					from I the only thing I could think of as far as Pop Culture uh is that that Christmas movie um yeah
					yeah I bet you've had some artists some singers or rappers from Chicago it's just not for sure we
					have Kyle singer ah yeah uh-huh and uh there there is a rapper called Freddie Gibbs he's from Gary
					Indiana and uh Gary Indiana could be a uh a discussion all of its own so yeah Gary's one of them
					yeah all right well that was a super fun conversation about American culture mm-hmm yeah I really
					enjoyed that so guys if you learned anything new about the US let us know down below and let us know
					what kind of particular cultural details you can tell us about your city where you're from we'd love
					to hear about that absolutely it was uh super fun to talk about this to learn a little bit about
					where you're from Emma and hablamos luego see you later bye
