				<p id="1cf468a0-53d4-819b-9a9a-cae70c121067" class="">DAN: Welcome to applying project management in the
					real world.<br />If you’ve joined us for this program’s previous courses, then you’ve developed a
					solid
					foundation of project management knowledge and skills.<br />Those courses covered how a project
					progresses through the initiation, planning, execution, and closing stages.<br />They also taught
					how to
					manage projects using different methodologies and approaches like Agile and Scrum.<br />If you
					haven’t
					completed the previous courses, we recommend checking them out before starting this course to ensure
					that you’re ready to work through all of the upcoming activities.<br />As you progress through this
					course, you’ll create project documents based on an imagined scenario.<br />You’ll learn details
					through
					conversations, emails, and other materials just as you would in a real world scenario.<br />By the
					end
					of this course, you’ll have developed a portfolio of project management documents that will
					demonstrate
					your ability to manage stakeholders and teams, organize plans, and communicate project
					details.<br />All
					of this can be valuable when applying for jobs or working on projects in your current line of
					work.<br />Before we go any further, I want to take a few minutes to introduce myself.<br />My name
					is
					Dan, and I’m a program manager here at Google.<br />And I’ll be your instructor for this
					course.<br />At
					Google, I work on a team that promotes responsible practices in designing, building, and applying
					Artificial Intelligence, also known as AI, and machine learning.<br />I support teams in adopting
					tools
					and techniques they can use to evaluate their machine learning models and determine whether they’re
					performing equitably.<br />I love this role because I get to support teams in building products that
					work for our users.<br />Before my current role, I worked on the Google AI residency program
					team.<br />This is a rotational program for people who are interested in doing AI research but who
					come
					from non-traditional backgrounds.<br />This work was compelling to me because I personally didn’t
					have
					any experience with AI or machine learning before coming to Google.<br />This just goes to show that
					if
					you have strong project management skills, you often don’t need to be a subject matter expert in a
					given
					domain to work in that field.<br />Prior to my time at Google, I worked outside of tech first as a
					math
					teacher and then as a sponsorship coordinator for a professional soccer team.<br />Throughout my
					career,
					I’ve always been passionate about education, whether that’s teaching students in the classroom or
					teaching developers how to ethically implement AI systems.<br />So I’m pretty excited about leading
					you
					through this course.<br />It should be a lot of fun.<br />Now let’s get right into the scenario that
					will apply to all of the activities in this course.<br />In this imagined scenario, a small
					restaurant
					chain called Sauce and Spoon wants to meet their annual growth and expansion goals.<br />As one way
					to
					meet these goals, they’ve decided to launch a pilot project to test out the impact of installing new
					table top menu tablets.<br />The new menu tablets will allow the restaurant to serve more guests in
					less
					time and will provide valuable data that will help Sauce and Spoon meet its business goals.<br />The
					company just hired Peta as their first in-house project manager to oversee the tablet rollout at two
					of
					the restaurant chains five locations.<br />Throughout the course, you’ll observe Peta as she guides
					her
					team through planning and executing the project deliverables.<br />Although she has five years of
					project management experience, Peta hasn’t managed a restaurant project before.<br />You’ll get to
					follow the project through its lifecycle as Peta learns about the restaurant industry, determines
					the
					goals of the project, negotiates with stakeholders, and much more.<br />Along the way, you’ll record
					details of the project to use in course activities.<br />You’ll also evaluate Peta’s project
					management
					skills as she works to complete this project in scope, on time, and within budget.<br />You’ll learn
					what works and what doesn’t and how to problem solve your way through a project.<br />As you
					progress
					through the course, we’ll review and practice key project management concepts, which include
					analyzing
					materials to identify project requirements, solve problems, and manage stakeholders applying
					important
					negotiation techniques and influencing skills, listening with empathy when working with a team, and
					practicing your stakeholder communication skills.<br />We’ll explore these concepts in more depth,
					and
					I’ll explain how each concept applies to the Sauce and Spoon project.<br />Each activity will
					contain
					guiding questions to help you create common project documents that you can speak to in a job
					interview
					and utilize throughout your career.<br />As you work through these activities, you may want to take
					notes on some of the information you learn.<br />Feel free to use whichever tool you prefer, whether
					that’s the Coursera note-taking system or another method.<br />In the upcoming videos, I’ll explain
					the
					project in more detail and share project management best practices so that you can complete the
					associated course activities.<br />Are you ready?<br />Let’s go.<br />You’ll analyze project
					documents
					and supporting materials to identify project requirements, evaluate stakeholders, and problem
					solve.<br />You’ll use a project charter as a tool to align project scope and goals among
					stakeholders.<br />And you’ll apply effective negotiation skills with stakeholders to prioritize
					project
					goals.<br />In this video, I’ll review the purpose and main components of a project charter so you
					can
					get started creating one for the Sauce and Spoon tablet rollout.<br />After this video, you’ll
					review
					supporting materials that will enable you to observe Peta as she initiates the project.<br />Then
					you’ll
					apply strategic thinking to create a project charter based on what you observed.<br />Strategic
					thinking
					involves analyzing documentation and talking with stakeholders to inform decisions based on the
					information available to you.<br />OK, let’s review the purpose and main components of a project
					charter.<br />A project charter is a formal document that clearly defines the project and outlines
					the
					necessary details to reach the project’s goals.<br />The project manager creates the charter during
					the
					initiation phase, which is the first phase of the project lifecycle.<br />The project charter helps
					you
					organize vital project information, create a framework for the work that needs to be done, and
					communicate those details to the necessary people.<br />It’s also useful as a reference throughout
					the
					project’s lifecycle, since it can help stakeholders realign on the project’s scope, goals, and
					costs.<br />The project charter contains key information about a project like the summary, goals,
					and
					deliverables.<br />The goal of the summary is to provide an overview of the project and to outline
					the
					goals you hope to accomplish.<br />Summaries should be brief, just a few sentences at most and to
					the
					point.<br />After the summary comes project goals and deliverables.<br />Project goals refer to the
					desired results of the project, and deliverables refer to specific tasks and tangible outcomes that
					enable the team to meet project goals.<br />In general, project goals address the overall result
					that
					stakeholders are aiming to achieve.<br />They are determined by input from stakeholders and the
					project
					manager.<br />For example, part of Sauce and Spoon’s annual growth and expansion goals is launching
					the
					tablet rollout project.<br />And one deliverable of the project is the successful installation of
					working tablets at two restaurant locations.<br />The last part of the project charter that we’ll
					cover
					here is scope.<br />Remember, that scope refers to the boundaries of a project.<br />Along with the
					scope, the charter contains information about work that’s out of scope.<br />Details that don’t
					contribute to the project’s goals are considered out of scope.<br />Scope was covered in a previous
					course, and I’ll continue to discuss it in more detail in an upcoming video.<br />Let’s recap what
					we
					just covered.<br />A project charter is a formal document that clearly defines the project and
					outlines
					the necessary details to reach the project’s goals.<br />The primary components of a project charter
					are
					the summary, goals, deliverables, and scope.<br />A charter can include other sections as well, such
					as
					budget and cost and success metrics.<br />In this video, we’ll discuss how to use the charter as a
					tool
					to get the project stakeholders in alignment about the project scope and goals.<br />Then in the
					upcoming activity, you’ll review supporting materials containing information about the Sauce and
					Spoon
					tablet rollout.<br />You’ll also observe how Peta guides a conversation among disagreeing
					stakeholders
					to get alignment on the project charter details.<br />Then you’ll identify key aspects of the
					conversation that will help you revise and clarify details in the charter you drafted in the last
					activity.<br />Let’s get into it.<br />Any time you’re communicating the details of your project,
					you
					need to think about your audience and what information is important to them.<br />When adding
					details to
					a project charter, ask yourself the following questions about your audience.<br />And if it’s
					helpful,
					try answering these questions in your notes.<br />Who are your stakeholders?<br />In this case, your
					audience includes all of your key stakeholders.<br />What details are most important to
					them?<br />Are
					there project details that they might disagree with?<br />Once you’ve identified what you believe
					are
					important details, review your charter and ensure all of those details are included.<br />From
					there,
					you’ll be able to present the charter to your stakeholders and confirm that everyone agrees with the
					project information.<br />Think of the project charter this way.<br />In addition to serving as a
					formal
					document that defines the project, a project charter is also an alignment tool.<br />Here alignment
					refers to reaching agreement between two or more parties.<br />A common cause of project failure is
					misalignment among stakeholders about the details of the project.<br />Misalignment can also happen
					between you and your stakeholders when you have differing visions for the project.<br />That’s why
					it’s
					so important to align with your stakeholders before the work begins.<br />Stakeholders generally
					aren’t
					involved in the day-to-day tasks of project executions, so it’s crucial to take time during the
					initiation phase to create a project charter that clearly lays out the details of a
					project.<br />This
					helps ensure that the team is working toward the outcomes expected by all of the stakeholders and
					not
					just some of them.<br />Usually the initiation phase is the most ideal time to make changes to the
					project.<br />As the project progresses into the planning and execution phases, substantive changes
					might require undoing work that’s already been completed.<br />So in this early phase of the project
					lifecycle, you shouldn’t be afraid to make adjustments.<br />Here’s an example of how you might
					experience misalignment.<br />Let’s say you’re discussing the main goals of the Sauce and Spoon
					project.<br />One stakeholder has a vision of being able to fully automate the ordering experience
					with
					the tablets over time.<br />Another stakeholder has a different goal.<br />Rather than fully
					automating
					ordering, they want the tablet rollout project to improve order accuracy.<br />To help resolve this
					situation, a project manager might facilitate a discussion between the two stakeholders to try and
					reach
					an agreement to confirm alignment on the project’s goals.<br />When you present a project charter to
					your stakeholders, it’s important to collect feedback and identify where there are
					misalignments.<br />Then you can make changes to address those misalignments.<br />If you and your
					stakeholders take the time early on to clearly define the project, then you’re much more likely to
					deliver the outcomes your stakeholders expect at the end of the project.<br />As a project manager,
					it’s
					important to record the feedback you receive and document any misalignments and their
					resolutions.<br />This allows you and your project team to reference those decisions later
					on.<br />One
					way to document misalignments and resolutions is to create an appendix with a timestamp for new or
					updated information.<br />An appendix is a section of additional content at the end of a
					document.<br />A timestamp includes the date and sometimes the time of when the new content was
					created
					or added to the document.<br />Awesome.<br />Let’s review some of the main ideas we’ve
					discussed.<br />Any time you communicate the details of a project, you need to think about your
					audience
					and what information is important to them.<br />In the case of a project charter, your audience is
					made
					up of your stakeholders.<br />A common cause of project failure is misalignment among stakeholders
					about
					the project details.<br />It’s important to take the time during the initiation phase to create a
					project charter that clearly lays out the key details of a project and to align with your
					stakeholders
					before the work begins.<br />And finally, document any misalignments in their resolutions in your
					notes
					and the project charter to reference later on.<br />[MUSIC PLAYING] By now you’ve drafted a project
					summary, goals, and deliverables in the project charter.<br />And you’ve identified details in the
					project charter where stakeholders need to be in alignment.<br />In this video, I’ll review SMART
					goals
					and discuss how to add specificity to your project goals.<br />I’ll also share some tips for
					researching
					industry success metrics, which are helpful in adding specificity to your goals and
					deliverables.<br />Being able to write specific, measurable goals is an important part of project
					management and a great way to demonstrate your project management skills to potential
					employers.<br />Then in the following activity, you’ll review supporting materials and update the
					goals
					and deliverables you’ve drafted in the project charter to make them smart.<br />Ready to
					begin?<br />Let’s go.<br />During the initiation phase, some of the project goals might be broad
					because
					not all of the project details have been determined.<br />While it’s OK to have broader goals, it’s
					helpful to add specificity where possible.<br />That’s because clarifying project goals early on can
					help you avoid misalignment and gain a clearer understanding of the project scope, budget, and
					timeline.<br />Remember, project goals are the desired outcomes of the project.<br />Outlining clear
					and
					specific goals is an important step in creating an effective project charter and crucial to
					launching a
					successful project.<br />So you’ll need to be able to accurately identify whether or not a goal has
					been
					met.<br />When your goals are clear, you’ll be able to determine your project
					deliverables.<br />Project
					deliverables are specific tasks or outcomes that contribute to the completion of a goal.<br />In
					your
					career as a project manager, you’ll likely encounter stakeholders who only vaguely describe the
					outcomes
					they want for a given project.<br />For example, a stakeholder might tell you that they’d more
					customers
					to use a certain service, or they’d like to sell more units of a particular product.<br />These are
					fine
					goals, but they’re not very specific.<br />You don’t know how many more customers, what kind of
					customers, or how many units that you’ll need in order to meet your goals.<br />As a project
					manager,
					it’s your role to ensure that the project goals are well defined so that you and your team have a
					clear
					roadmap.<br />This not only allows you to focus but also eliminates wasted time and miscommunication
					going forward.<br />You can create clearly outlined goals with the help of the SMART method we
					discussed
					earlier in this program.<br />The SMART method helps turn your project goals into SMART
					goals.<br />Remember, this means your goals are specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and
					timebound.<br />These qualities can help you measure your success more accurately and allow you to
					make
					more precise adjustments along the way.<br />Let’s review some best practices for ensuring your
					project
					goals are also SMART goals.<br />To make a goal more specific, make sure that it provides answers to
					questions like, what am I aiming to accomplish and what are the requirements and constraints of this
					goal.<br />Here’s a tip I like to use to add specificity to goals.<br />Look for words in your goals
					that might be subjective or based on an opinion, such as bigger, better, or faster.<br />Once you’ve
					identified subjective words, connect with your stakeholders to agree on a definition of what it
					actually
					means to make something bigger or better or faster.<br />What is bigger or better entail in
					practice?<br />Faster by how much specifically?<br />The SMART method helps you make your goals more
					specific by making them measurable.<br />For example, if your stakeholder wants to increase company
					profits, ask by how much.<br />Do they want to increase profits by 5%, by 30%?<br />Adding numbers
					and
					figures to your goal makes it a lot easier to know when you’ve achieved it.<br />If you’re having
					trouble making a goal measurable, research how others in your industry quantify success.<br />This
					is
					called benchmarking, which refers to evaluating success against a standard.<br />For example, there
					are
					lots of ways to measure success in the restaurant industry.<br />You might search online for
					information
					using queries like how do restaurants measure success or how do you evaluate employee training
					sessions.<br />You’ll likely find a number of results.<br />Some common metrics include table
					turnover
					rate or the average length of time that a guest spends at their table, prime cost, which is the
					labor
					cost plus the total cost of goods like food and drink, and average check amount, which is the
					average
					amount of money guests spend on a given meal.<br />Most industries from the hospitality industry to
					the
					entertainment industry to the construction industry will have their own metrics for
					success.<br />That
					includes the tech industry too.<br />Metrics are a big part of how we measure success here at
					Google.<br />SMART goals are also attainable, which means that the goal is challenging but not
					impossible to reach.<br />Ask yourself and the team, can it be done.<br />Do you have the time,
					resources, and people available to complete the goal on time and within budget?<br />If not, you’ll
					need
					to make some changes to your goals.<br />And all project goals should be relevant.<br />Ask
					yourself,
					does it make sense for us as a company or as a project team to pursue this goal.<br />One best
					practice
					for determining the relevance of your project goals is to notice how closely your project goals
					align
					with the wider goals of your company or organization.<br />Here at Google, we use a tool for
					organization wide goal setting called Objectives and Key Results or OKRs.<br />Other organizations
					might
					use a different term for their own goal setting.<br />For us, OKRs combine a goal and a metric to
					determine a measurable outcome.<br />For example, one of Sauce and Spoon’s broader objectives is to
					make
					fresh quick food for the working families in its community.<br />So a relevant goal for the Sauce
					and
					Spoon tablet rollout might be to decrease customer checkout time by 10% on average in the first six
					weeks after implementation.<br />This project goal helps the restaurant chain reach its larger goal
					to
					provide quick meals for guests.<br />And the last part of the SMART framework is to make your goal
					timebound.<br />You’ll want to add a deadline to your goal so that when it’s supposed to be
					completed.<br />OK, let’s review.<br />SMART stands for Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant,
					and
					Timebound.<br />If your goals are SMART, you can feel confident about including them in your project
					charter.<br />In the upcoming activity, you’ll collect information from the supporting materials
					that
					will help you turn the goals you drafted into SMART goals.<br />You’ll also identify any additional
					goals and add them to the project charter.<br />[MUSIC PLAYING] Now that you’ve updated the project
					charter and edited some of the project goals to make them SMART, it’s time to discuss scope,
					benefits,
					and cost.<br />Coming up, we’ll explore what to think about when adding these items to your project
					charter.<br />After this video, you’ll review new supporting materials and use what you’ve learned
					to
					identify benefits and costs, which you’ll add to your charter.<br />Let’s get started.<br />When
					thinking about what kind of information to include in a project charter, it’s always good to
					consider
					the primary audience who will be reading it.<br />And since the goal of creating a project charter
					is to
					communicate with your stakeholders, they’re your primary audience.<br />Here’s an example.<br />If
					you
					know that one of the benefits of your project would be of particular interest to a key stakeholder,
					you’ll want to make sure to emphasize this benefit in your project charter.<br />The stakeholders
					reading your charter might not seem more detailed project plans and other documents later
					on.<br />So
					it’s important to get consensus on the critical elements now while the project details are still
					being
					finalized.<br />You’ve already identified and hopefully resolved any misalignments about the
					project,
					vision, and goals.<br />Next, you need to get aligned with your stakeholders on scope, benefits, and
					cost.<br />We talked about scope earlier, but as a quick refresher scope refers to the boundaries of
					the
					project, for example, the number of restaurants taking part in the pilot.<br />Details that don’t
					contribute to the project’s goals are considered out of scope.<br />To determine what’s in and out
					of
					scope, think about what’s needed to achieve the project goal.<br />Keep the following questions in
					mind.<br />Which project details are your stakeholders aligned on that would be considered in
					scope?<br />Do your stakeholders disagree on any elements?<br />Are there any details you should
					designate as out-of-scope for this particular project?<br />As you think about these questions, take
					notes on what you find and refer to them as you complete the scope section of your project charter
					in
					the upcoming activity.<br />After you’ve figured out the scope of your project, you’ll need to focus
					on
					project, benefits, and costs.<br />Benefits are the expected gains of a project.<br />These can be
					direct monetary gains or indirect benefits like an improvement in customer engagement or
					satisfaction.<br />Costs refer to the money spent on project tasks and the prices of things like
					time,
					resources, and labor.<br />Costs can be evaluated and managed using a project budget.<br />A budget
					is
					an estimate of the amount of money allocated to complete the project.<br />In the next activity,
					you’ll
					need to review the supporting materials and take notes on details that can help you identify the
					benefits and costs of the tablet rollout.<br />You’ll use that information to add two lists to your
					project charter, a list of benefits and a list of costs.<br />Usually you can find the benefits the
					project will bring in the business case or project proposal.<br />For example, your list of benefits
					for
					the tablet rollout might include its potential to speed up service and increase sales by an
					estimated
					percent.<br />Here’s another benefit.<br />The tablets will provide the restaurant with clear data
					points on customer ordering and an integrated point-of-sale system to help guide decision-making in
					the
					future.<br />A list of benefits can help you identify potential project goals you might have
					missed.<br />A list of costs will include items the organization will have to pay for in order to
					get
					the job done like the price of labor or materials.<br />Listing out costs helps your stakeholders
					weigh
					the benefits against the amount of money required to realize those benefits.<br />You can build a
					list
					of costs by working with stakeholders to get estimates on labor, materials, and any other factors
					that
					might cost the business money during the project.<br />Earlier I told you that the benefits of a
					project
					should outweigh the costs, this is almost always the case when a project is initiated or
					proposed.<br />When you add these details to the charter, it helps visualize them in one place and
					makes
					the costs and benefits crystal clear to the stakeholders.<br />This section is used a lot as an aid
					to
					help make sure stakeholders agree that it’s worth the money to pursue the project.<br />OK, let’s
					recap.<br />Scope refers to the boundaries of the project.<br />Benefits refer to the expected gains
					of
					the project, and costs refer to the money spent on project tasks plus the prices of things like
					time,
					resources, and labor.<br />Ready to get back to your project charter?<br />Head over to the activity
					where you’ll review and analyze the supporting materials to identify the appropriate scope,
					benefits,
					and costs for the source and spoon tablet rollout.<br />Then meet me in the next video, where we’ll
					discuss techniques for negotiating with stakeholders.<br />[MUSIC PLAYING] By now you’ve filled in
					most
					of your project charter, the summary, goals, and deliverables, scope, benefits, and
					costs.<br />You’ve
					also learned more about the project and your stakeholders, who are the core audience of the
					charter.<br />In this video, you’ll learn how to prepare for some of the negotiations you’ll have
					with
					stakeholders about your projects.<br />We’ll spend some time exploring stakeholders individual
					interests, involvement, and contributions to the project.<br />Then we’ll figure out how to use
					stakeholder influence to benefit the project and how to effectively work with
					stakeholders.<br />Almost
					every part of a project requires input and agreement from multiple stakeholders.<br />And of course,
					not
					all stakeholders will value the same input or agree on the same things.<br />That’s why a successful
					project manager needs to be a skilled negotiator too.<br />After this video, you’ll review
					supporting
					materials about the Sauce and Spoon project stakeholders to write a persuasive email demonstrating
					your
					negotiation skills.<br />Let’s get started.<br />As we discussed earlier in the program, some common
					project aspects that are negotiated during the course of a project include scope, costs, and
					benefits,
					timeline, success criteria, roles and responsibilities, and resources.<br />This is another reason
					getting aligned with stakeholders early on is helpful.<br />Good alignment can help prevent some of
					these types of negotiations down the road.<br />Early in the project, it’s important to agree on the
					scope.<br />Take note of how Peta focuses on securing stakeholder buy-in for that.<br />And it’s
					good to
					remember that a lot of the skills she’ll apply here will be useful to negotiating other elements
					throughout the project’s lifecycle whether that’s the budget, timeline, or product
					requirements.<br />You’ll prepare for this and future negotiations by creating a stakeholder
					analysis.<br />The stakeholder analysis is a visual representation of all of the
					stakeholders.<br />It
					helps you understand who your stakeholders are, what their priorities are, and how they prefer to
					communicate.<br />It can help you determine how strongly you need to prioritize a particular
					stakeholders’ needs or goals on the project.<br />Stakeholders have a vested interest in the project
					success.<br />Understanding your stakeholders helps you figure out the right people to include and
					important conversations and how to prioritize the different needs of the different
					stakeholders.<br />This is key to getting the support you need throughout the project.<br />As part
					of
					your analysis, try to answer as many questions as you can about each stakeholder.<br />Then as you
					review your list, identify which stakeholders directly influence the project and the level of
					interest
					each one has.<br />A stakeholders influence is related to how much power they have and how much
					their
					actions affect the project outcome.<br />Interest refers to how much the stakeholders’ needs will be
					affected by project operations and outcomes.<br />So for example, if a stakeholder has high interest
					and
					high influence, it might be very important that you keep them informed and make sure their goals for
					the
					project are top priority.<br />If they have low interest and low influence, then you might be able
					to
					deprioritize one of their personal preferences for the project.<br />Mapping these out on a power
					interest grid will give you even more clarity about whom to prioritize and how best to approach
					negotiations with each stakeholder.<br />You’ll find a stakeholder analysis template in power
					interest
					grid and the supporting materials of the upcoming activity.<br />Once you have a good idea of who
					your
					stakeholders are and what role they play in the project’s success, you can use this information to
					support your project negotiations.<br />One of the most important negotiations will deal with
					defining
					and maintaining project scope.<br />Stakeholders might push to add more into the scope, and it’s
					your
					job as the project manager to negotiate what’s realistic within the given budget and timeline
					expectations.<br />OK, let’s review.<br />Some common project negotiations you’re likely to have
					with
					stakeholders include aspects of the charter like costs and benefits and success criteria, as well as
					other project aspects like roles and responsibilities and project resources.<br />You can prepare
					for
					these negotiations by conducting a stakeholder analysis using a power interest grid.<br />Coming up,
					you’ll review supporting materials and complete a stakeholder analysis for the Sauce and Spoon
					tablet
					rollout.<br />In the last activity, you completed the stakeholder analysis and mapped out which
					stakeholders have the most power, influence, and interest in the project’s outcome.<br />Having a
					better
					understanding of the people who will be evaluating the success of your project makes it so much
					easier
					to strategize the best ways to communicate with them and get the support you need.<br />So coming
					up,
					we’ll learn more about how to successfully navigate a negotiation with stakeholders.<br />As a
					project
					manager, you’ve got a lot of helpful tools at your disposal.<br />But even the most skilled
					negotiators
					have to put their skills to the test in order to meet project goals and gain stakeholder
					satisfaction.<br />There will be times when you need to negotiate a sensitive aspect of the
					project’s
					goals or scope or there could be a disagreement among stakeholders or you might disagree with
					something
					that stakeholders want.<br />You’ll need to use negotiating techniques to move a disagreement from
					stalemate to solution.<br />After this video, you’ll identify shared benefits for your stakeholders
					that
					you’ll eventually use to write a negotiation email.<br />Let’s get started.<br />When it comes to
					project management, persuasion and negotiation are constructive tools you can use to enhance
					communication, clarify want and needs, and achieve workable solutions for everyone
					involved.<br />Being
					skilled at persuasion and negotiation will also boost your level of influence.<br />It’s important
					that
					you view the people you’re negotiating with as your colleagues and peers, not as
					opponents.<br />That’s
					why you do a stakeholder analysis so you can get to know your stakeholders as people with their own
					jobs
					and responsibilities and as partners who want the project to succeed.<br />When you experience
					conflict
					or disagreement among your stakeholders, it’s in your best interest to address those challenges,
					build
					consensus among the stakeholder groups, and de-escalate conflict.<br />One way to do this is to find
					solutions that are mutually beneficial.<br />Mutual benefit is when all parties involved gain some
					kind
					of benefit or advantage.<br />For example, let’s say there’s a disagreement over how many people to
					hire
					for a project.<br />You’d like to hire five, but a stakeholder wants to limit the head count to
					three.<br />A solution that would offer mutual benefit might be to install automated software to
					pick up
					some of the work, or another solution might be to adjust the timeline or expectations so that five
					people aren’t needed in order to reach the project goal.<br />The stakeholder gets to have their
					desired
					smaller team size, and you’re able to complete tasks with fewer people.<br />The goal here is to
					reach a
					solution that maximizes benefits, minimizes losses, and is fair for all.<br />Brainstorm all
					possible
					options that meet this criteria.<br />Then during your negotiations, you’ll be able to present
					multiple
					alternatives and choose one that benefits everyone to some degree.<br />Now as much as you want to
					satisfy your stakeholders, it’s just as important to think about what trade-offs you’re willing to
					make.<br />To do this successfully, you need a clear understanding of project priorities.<br />You
					have
					to know what’s most important when it comes to scope, timeline, and budget.<br />For example, if
					there’s
					a specific deadline that has to be met, then you’ll need to negotiate any changes to the scope that
					might cause the project to go past that deadline.<br />If the product needs to look or function a
					certain way, then the requirements are a top priority, and you could negotiate aspects of the budget
					or
					timeline in order to adhere to the scope.<br />A common tool used for determining priorities is the
					triple constraint model or the iron triangle, which we covered in an earlier course.<br />The triple
					constraint will help you decide if a project request is acceptable and what impact it will
					have.<br />OK, let’s review.<br />Persuasion and negotiation are constructive tools you can use to
					enhance communication, clarify wants and needs, and achieve workable solutions for everyone
					involved.<br />The goal is to reach a mutual benefit, which is when all parties involved gain some
					kind
					of benefit or advantage.<br />That’s it for now.<br />Coming up, you’ll prepare for negotiations
					about
					the project scope.<br />To do this, you’ll identify the mutual benefits and evaluate the impact of
					compromising on scope.<br />So far you’ve identified mutual benefits and their impacts to scope,
					timeline, and budget.<br />In this video, you’ll learn how to apply influence and constructive power
					to
					stakeholder negotiations.<br />Then you’ll use this knowledge to identify stakeholders who’d be
					helpful
					in supporting your position in upcoming negotiations.<br />We talked earlier about how the ability
					to
					influence is such a key element of effective project management.<br />You might remember an earlier
					video where we covered four steps to effective influencing.<br />Dr. Jay Conger lists these four
					steps
					to effectively influence, establish credibility, frame for common ground, provide evidence, and
					connect
					emotionally.<br />One way to apply all four of these steps is to form a coalition.<br />A coalition
					is a
					temporary alliance or partnering of individuals or groups in order to achieve a common purpose or to
					engage in a joint activity.<br />When two or more people advocate together for an idea, they’re able
					to
					exert more influence than if they attempted to act alone.<br />Forming a coalition with the right
					group
					of people is a powerful and effective negotiation technique.<br />For example, think about some of
					the
					key stakeholders you identified earlier from the Sauce and Spoon project.<br />Which ones could you
					form
					a coalition with to help you negotiate one out of scope items that was requested?<br />Creating a
					coalition boosts your credibility by involving others who support your goal.<br />The people in your
					coalition can help you find common ground and provide evidence.<br />Plus you can connect
					emotionally by
					including someone who either has a positive relationship with the stakeholder or understands the
					stakeholder and the goal well enough to make a connection.<br />An effective coalition includes
					people
					with the right mix of influence or power and interest.<br />In other words, identify people who can
					help
					you achieve your goal through their vested interest in expertise on the subject of your
					project.<br />You’ll also want to balance your coalition with people who have a high level of power
					in
					your organization to help influence and get things done.<br />A stakeholder analysis is a useful
					tool to
					help guide coalition building.<br />Once you’ve decided who’s a good fit for your coalition, reach
					out
					to them and ask for their support.<br />A good way to do this is through a well-crafted email, but
					you
					could also ask in-person or with a phone call, whichever method you think is most
					appropriate.<br />When
					you make your request, clearly state the issue you’re attempting to resolve.<br />Explain which
					aspect
					of the project is being negotiated.<br />Then ask if they might consider supporting your position or
					solution and state what that is.<br />And of course, refer to that person’s sources of power or
					interest
					you identified.<br />For example, if you’re negotiating the timing of the project, you might say
					something like the timing of the launch will affect business hours, and your experience managing
					restaurant projects year round could be helpful in explaining why this factor needs to be
					reconsidered.<br />This will let them know that you value them, why it impacts them, and why you
					think
					they can be of specific help to you.<br />Let’s recap the main ideas.<br />The ability to influence
					is a
					big part of project management.<br />There are four steps to effective influencing, as identified by
					Dr. Jay Conger, establish credibility frame, frame for common ground, provide evidence, and connect
					emotionally.<br />One way to gain influence is to form a coalition.<br />A coalition is a temporary
					alliance or partnering of groups in order to achieve a common purpose or to engage in a joint
					activity.<br />An effective coalition includes people with the right mix of power and
					interest.<br />You’ll want to play to those strengths when forming a coalition and influencing
					members
					of the coalition.<br />Great.<br />Now you’ve prepared for future negotiations.<br />Up next, you’ll
					use
					what you learned about coalition building and write a persuasive email to influence these
					stakeholders
					to join the coalition.<br />ROWENA: Congratulations on finishing this video in the Google Project
