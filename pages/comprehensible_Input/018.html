					Are you ready to learn some real life English with comprehensible input? Well, good, because today
					we've got a great video full of useful vocabulary, and it's going to be a whole lot of fun.<br>
					We're going camping. Let's go. Hello everyone. It is your English speaking friend, Kyle, and I am
					sweaty. I'm sweaty, guys. But today, we're going to bring you another awesome video full of great
					vocabulary. You know, we're gonna check out some interesting culture. It's just going to be a fun
					time. Guys, the camera wife and I are camping and we're bringing you guys with camera wife.
					What's the first thing we have to do?<br>
					Uh, set up the tent.
					Set up our tent. All right, let's do that. All right, guys. That's a tent.
					Let me show you guys me and camera wife's home for the night. Come on.
					Okay, guys. Here we have our door. The door to our home. Open our door. Oh, it's a big house.
					Wait, wait, wait. Number one rule, no shoes in the tent. You listening, camera wife?
					Yes.<br>
					Okay, come on. Come on. All right, guys.
					This is our tent. This is our home for the night. And we put this little blanket down. We brought
					some pillows.<br>
					And guys, this is what happens when you're married, okay? When you have a wife. When you have a
					wife, she makes your life more comfortable, more clean, more nice. Because guys, if I was here
					alone, I'd be sleeping on this. I'd be like, "That's single Kyle." But with camera wife, I have a
					blanket. She brings pillows. This, guys, is called a sleeping bag because it's a bag that you do
					what, wife?<br>
					Sleeping.
					You sleep in it. It's really hot right now, guys. I hope it gets cold in the night because if not,
					me and camera wife will be sweating. That won't be fun.
					Okay, home is set up. What should we do now, camera wife?<br>
					Make dinner for your wife.
					What do you guys think? Should I make dinner for the camera wife?
					Yes.
					All right, let's go. All right, guys.
					We're going to make a delicious dinner.
					But wife, what do we need to make dinner?<br>
					Uh to start the fire.
					We need to start the fire. So, I am going to start the fire with these two sticks. You have to rub
					them together very quickly. Just kidding, guys. Nobody has time for that. Let me show you how we're
					going to start the fire today with a torch. This is called a torch, guys.<br>
					And we're going to use this torch to start fire because I don't have time to rub two sticks
					together. So, we're going to use a little bit of paper. These are bills, guys. You know what bills
					are?<br>
					Bills are when you owe money to a company. They send you bills and it says, "Hey, you have to pay us
					$100." I'm not paying nothing. Right, camera wife? This is what I think of those bills.
					Yeah, you already paid them. All right, guys. Camera wife, when you're making a fire, should you
					start with big giant sticks?<br>
					No.
					Or little sticks?
					Little little sticks.
					All right, guys. Our fire is going and our cast iron skillet is getting hot.
					So, guys, we're going to make a dish that several people have asked me about.
					And this is a dish that is popular both in Ukraine and in Russia. And an interesting thing is that
					I've had both Russians and Ukrainians ask me to make this dish. This dish is called borch.
					Borch is a a soup. We're going to make it with beef and beets. It's a red soup and it's very famous
					in that part of the world. We're going to make that in a few minutes, but first we're going to get
					something else ready which is going to be a delicious dessert. So guys, since both Russians and
					Ukrainians asked me to make borch, I really wanted to celebrate both countries. So I the borch
					recipe that I found that looked the best is Ukrainian borch. That's what it said. So I decided to
					find a Russian dessert that we can make for after we eat our bors.<br>
					And we're going to cook all this on our fire. Guys, this this dessert is baked apples. That's the
					translation. But in Russian, it would be something like pet Russian friends. I tried my best, guys.
					I have no idea how the Russian language is pronounced. I haven't studied it at all, but I'm trying
					my best to represent you guys and make something delicious from your homeland. So, let's get this
					dessert ready and we'll have it slowly cooking on the fire while we make everything else because
					once we get going on the borch, everything's going to start happening quick. You guys know how it
					goes when we're in the kitchen.<br>
					So, we're going to take our apples, take our cleaver, brought my cutting board here, and we're going
					to cut the tops off. Just like that. Just like that.<br>
					Then, we've got our cing tool to cut out the core. And this is similar to the dolma that we just
					made. You have to cut out the core so that you can stuff it with delicious things. So, let me cut
					the cores out of this and I'll show you the next step in a second. All right, guys. We cut the
					middles out of the apples. Camera wife is eating the part that I cut out, so we didn't waste
					anything. And here, guys, we've got nuts. A few different kinds of nuts. Let me show you what we
					call these different ones. This is called a cashew. And I put cinnamon on all of them. So, that's a
					cashew with cinnamon. This kind is walnuts.<br>
					That's a walnut. And these ones are my favorites. Pecans and raisins like we used in the plow. And
					like I said, guys, I took cinnamon earlier and poured it over all these. Now we put it in here.
					Time to stuff to stuff our apples with our nuts and raisins. Smells good already. All right, guys.
					Now, a little bit of honey, guys. I really like this because it's going to be delicious, but also
					very healthy. All good. healthy, real ingredients. And then we will just fill it the rest of the way
					up and the rest will be camera wife's breakfast.<br>
					All right, I saved the tops of the apples to be like a lid. And now we're going to wrap them in
					foil. This is foil. Some people call it aluminum foil.
					Some people call it tin foil. I just call it foil. We're going to make sure we wrap our apples very
					good in foil.<br>
					All right, guys. Now, we're going to take these and put them in a nice warm place in the fire. And
					while we're cooking our borch, our dessert, we'll be baking. All right, guys. We've got our cast
					iron skillet getting hot. This is another little skillet. I'm going to make us some bread to go with
					the borch.<br>
					But first, we have to get our meat cooking. I just put salt and pepper on it. Let's get it cooking.
					Okay, guys.
					This is essential camping vocabulary.
					This is to make mosquitoes leave you alone. We call it bug spray. Okay, during the day you don't
					really need it, but if you're in a place like this in the night, guys, you better have some bug
					spray. So, put some bug spray on so the mosquitoes will leave us alone.<br>
					No, I don't want them biting my face.
					Eat your face.
					They're going to bite camera wife's face, not me. Bug spray, guys. Necessary for camping. All right,
					guys. Now, our beef is brown. Baby, can you show the beef? We need to take that out. start cooking
					our vegetables. All right, guys.<br>
					I got the vegetables ready yesterday.
					Not blood, guys. It's beet juice. I got everything ready yesterday so I wouldn't have to be doing
					this out here at the campfire. Here we have onions, celery, and carrots. These are going in. And in
					a little bit, we'll add the beets. All right, guys. We have to chop some garlic. Garlic goes in
					traditional borch. But even if it did not, I would still put it because garlic makes everything
					better. Camera life, what is the one thing that garlic does not make better?<br>
					Kisses.
					Kisses.
					Why?
					Cuz it's weird.
					Makes your breath smell bad. So, that is the only thing that garlic doesn't make better. So, if this
					was our first date, maybe I wouldn't use the garlic. But, we're married, so we kiss even with garlic
					on our breath. It's okay. Thank you.<br>
					All right, guys. Everything is starting to come together beautifully. Oh, what is this, wife?
					Can opener.
					Can opener. We need to open the can of tomato sauce. Start with that much and see how it looks. All
					right, guys. We'll add our beets now. And this is where the color is going to start looking amazing.
					Okay, guys. I think it's looking great.<br>
					Camera wife says she wants to eat it already, but our vegetables are getting cooked down. Now, we're
					going to put our meat back in.
					And then we're going to add beef broth.
					Okay, this is the liquid that's going to make it soup. All right, guys. Now, this is a really cool
					pan set because you can cook on this, but it's also a lid. So, we're going to let that cook for a
					little bit. That meat's going to get super tender. Those flavors are going to get stronger. And I
					can't wait. Okay, guys. It's already looking delicious.<br>
					Look at this. Look at that.
					Wow, guys. I chopped up some potatoes over here. And I peeled them first. I peeled the skin off of
					them with the peeler.
					Then I chopped them with my big knife, my big cleaver. Now they're going in.
					What am I doing, wife?
					Stirring.
					Stirring. We stir it up. Okay, guys.
					This is called dill. Dill is an herb, and I love the way it smells. It smells so good, guys. So, I
					was excited when I saw that dill is an important ingredient. And I guess for authentic Ukrainian
					borch, you need a lot of dill.<br>
					So, let's chop this up and in the fire.
					Guys, I just want to tell you one thing, but I forgot to show you this. This is called a cooler,
					guys. A cooler, you put ice in it so that you can put your food in there and it keeps it cold. Right
					now, I'm using it as a seat. So, guys, what I wanted to tell you, cooking like this is very special
					for me and for years, guys. I've loved cooking. I've been cooking steak and ribs, chicken, meat,
					Americanstyle barbecue for years and I loved it. But cooking for you guys, cooking your guys'
					national dishes. When I made plav, when I made dolma, when we made Turkish kebab, now we're making
					borch. Guys, it's given me something that I haven't felt in 10 years. The excitement of cooking.
					Guys, I've been looking forward to this for days. I've been excited to come out here with my wife,
					make this, share in your culture, and it's something I haven't felt with cooking in a long time
					because I've been making the same things over and over and over. Now, it's an adventure again. It's
					an adventure again, and I am so happy. I'm thrilled.<br>
					Thrilled is a way to say very excited, very happy. Thrilled to share these experiences with you
					guys. I appreciate you all being here with me. Cooking is becoming a way that we could share each
					other's cultures. That way we could share this special time together. And when you explore new
					cultures, especially when you're really getting into the culture, when you're learning about the
					people, when you're eating their food, we connect, guys. We're connecting and you make the world a
					little bit better place to live in. All right, guys. Let's finish up this Porsche. All right, guys.
					Next ingredient and last ingredient, cabbage.<br>
					This is cabbage. And you put this in at the end so that it doesn't cook too much. It still stays
					kind of crunchy.
					Look at that borch, guys. See, that's looking good. I cannot wait. Let's put in our cabbage. And
					now, we stir.
					All right, guys. We're also making some campfire bread. Now, this bread is kind of like the
					flatbread that I've made in some other videos, but you can see it's a darker brown. It's almost the
					same color as my wife. Let me see your hand, baby.<br>
					So, I love that color. We're going to cook this bread. It's brown because it's rye bread like this.
					That would be more traditional in Ukraine. So, we're going to cook that on this skillet over here.
					Cook it for a couple minutes. And guys, it's going to be delicious to have some bread to dip in the
					borch and get that juice. The cabbage just has to cook for a few more minutes and that borch will be
					ready, guys. And we're ready to eat.<br>
					All right, guys. We're letting the borch cook for a few more minutes. Our bread is just about done.
					You guys hear those birds? I hope you could hear them good on the microphone because it's so
					peaceful out here, guys. I absolutely love being in nature. My wife's very happy, too. We haven't
					been looking at our phones. I'm only looking at it for the recipe and for what I'm about to tell you
					guys. But it's super good to be out here, not playing on your phone, not watching TV, just being
					here with somebody you care about, doing cool things. This is what being a human is all about. So
					anyway, you guys know when I try new cuisine from a different country, we have to learn some facts.
					Okay? Like I said guys, both the Russians and the Ukrainians want to claim borch. It's like when I
					made dolma. Of course, the Iraqis, they all say, "Oh, that's an Iraqi dish." The people from Turkey,
					they say, "That's a Turkish dish." There's a lot of dishes that are like that, guys. And South
					America, everybody invented the empanada and aripas. But in order to honor both of those countries,
					we're going to learn some interesting facts about both Ukraine and Russia. So, let's start with a
					couple interesting facts about the country of Russia. Camera wife, what is the biggest country on
					Earth?<br>
					Russia.
					Russia is the largest country on this whole planet. And in fact, 1/8 of all the land on planet Earth
					is in Russia. Second interesting fact, my son would know this one. The first man to go into orbit in
					space was a Russian. Yuri, I don't know how to pronounce his last name. I would say Gagarin.
					Gagarin. I'm not sure how to pronounce it with a Russian accent, but Yuri was the first man to go
					into orbit. And I'm sure he's a Russian hero because here the man who walked on the moon, Neil
					Armstrong, is an American hero. So, I'm sure the Russians are very proud of Yuri. Next, the oldest
					and deepest deepest lake in the world is in Russia. Lake Bal. I would say Bal, but I'm not sure if
					that's how it's pronounced. It's located in Siberia, and it holds 20% of the world's unfrozen fresh
					water, guys. 20% of all the fresh water in the world is in this lake in Russia. That is huge.
					And I thought Lake Michigan was big. I want to see this lake and maybe fish in it. Okay, guys. How
					about Ukraine? In Ukraine, there's an instrument that they use to make music. Something they use to
					make music. An instrument that is 8 ft long. 8 ft is about 2 m, guys. And it's called a Carpathian
					Alpine horn. Next, there are many sunflowers in Ukraine. In Ukraine, the sunflower is a national
					symbol. And in the summer, fields, fields of gold line the countryside. I bet that's a beautiful
					sight. Next, the Ukrainian city of Kiev is one of the oldest cities in all of Eastern Europe.
					And it was founded more than 1,400 years ago. That is like six times as old as the United States.
					That's an old city.<br>
					All right, guys. Let's eat some bors.
					All right, guys. Time to serve up our borch. Oh, that looks great.
					Okay, guys. Now, the final touches. From what I've seen, in Ukrainian borch, you have to put a nice
					scoop of sour cream on top. Like that. Just a little bit for the wife. I like sour cream, though, so
					I want more. Okay. And then a little bit more dill.
					That looks beautiful.<br>
					And then we've got our bread here.
					Campfire bread.
					Oh, that looks so beautiful.
					Let me put this away. All right, guys.
					I'm going to be a gentleman and let the camera wife try hers first. Let's see what she thinks. Okay,
					beautiful camera wife.<br>
					It's very hot, so she's getting it. Let me try the broth.
					The broth. Wow. Oh, it's so good. I'm more.
					You like it?<br>
					Now, let me try the meat.
					Is it soft?<br>
					It's so good. I'm more Now, the bread.
					Wow. More. What is this?<br>
					All right. Let's try some borched friends. I want a little bit of the sour cream, a little bit of
					the broth, and some of the meat.<br>
					Wow, that is awesome, guys. Let's try some potato with cabbage, garlic, and onion. It is very hot,
					but absolutely delicious. Let me try a little bit of the bread.
					Wow, the bread is amazing.<br>
					Guys, this is my first time cooking on a campfire. I'm pretty proud. I think we did pretty good.
					This was incredible.<br>
					Camera wife and I are going to eat.
					Guys, if you haven't tried borch before, I recommend it. And it makes me want to try more Russian
					and Ukrainian dishes.<br>
					My wife loves borch and the bread, guys, was so good. I think that might be the best meal ever
					cooked on a campfire in Indiana anyway. All right, guys. We had our borch. Now it's time for our
					dessert. The Russian baked apples. I'm scared, guys. I don't know if they cooked good because you're
					supposed to do them in an oven. I cooked them. I wrapped them in foil and threw them in a fire. So,
					I hope that they didn't burn.<br>
					We're going to see.
					Wow.
					Super soft.
					Oh, wow.
					Okay. So, on one video I saw they put sour cream on it. I'm going to try that cuz you know we like
					to be authentic here.<br>
					Really?
					Yep. Let's see.
					Use a little more honey. The baked apple tastes delicious though, guys. Tastes just like an apple
					pie. Like that, which is very popular here. Something we enjoy eating. A little raisin on there.
					Guys, what I really like about this, it's simple. These are ingredients you probably have around the
					house. Very healthy. All right, I'm going to eat my uh dessert here and we'll talk to you guys in a
					few minutes. All right, guys.<br>
					Wanted to make this little video before it gets too dark. Guys, it's beautiful out here. This is the
					the campground.
					You can see it's this big open field, trees everywhere. Looks really beautiful here because of the
					hills. A hill is when the ground goes up and down. Guys, I just love to be in a place like this.
					All this open space, fresh air, and the best part is what, wife?
					I don't know.
					We're all alone.<br>
					Oh, yeah.
					Nobody else here, guys, because it is Wednesday.
					Yeah.
					Nobody goes camping on a Wednesday but us. So, guys, we have this whole campground to ourselves.
					Just wanted to show you this big, beautiful green space. And uh yeah, this is Indiana, guys. My home
					home state, Indiana. When I think of Indiana, I think of green, open air, big fields. This is
					Indiana.<br>
					And this is a especially beautiful place in Indiana. And I'm happy to be here with you guys and the
					lovely camera wife.
					All right, guys. This is called a lantern. A lantern makes light. This is a really cool one because
					it's small and it was pretty cheap, guys. I looked all over. A lot of them were super expensive.
					This one was only like $10.<br>
					So, I'm really happy about that. So, we have a nice lantern, so we have light in here. It's very
					dark outside. It's still pretty hot, so we're hoping that it gets cooler, but this is our home for
					the night, guys. Uh camera wife and I had an awesome time, guys. We were just sitting out there in
					that big field for probably an hour and a half, maybe two hours, I don't know, at least an hour. But
					it was so nice just the open air. Do you guys hear that noise?<br>
					There's a lot of interesting noises out here, the animals. We saw some bats. You can hear the bats.
					Now, we're going to try and get some sleep in this hot night. So, I'll tell you guys in the morning
					if we get some good sleep or not. Good night, guys.<br>
					Good morning. Bonjour. Buenos. Tell me how to say good morning in your language in the comments.
					Anyway, it is morning.<br>
					As you can see, guys, we slept a little bit, but it was a bit difficult because right above our tent
					there was some animal. I don't know if he was looking for a wife. I don't know if he was scared. But
					when I tell you guys all night long, I mean all night long, this animal was like Chi chi chi ch ch
					ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch
					ch ch ch ch chi. I don't know if he even breathes, but all night long chi chi ch ch ch ch ch ch ch
					ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch
					ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch chi ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch
					ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch
					ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch. His one job is to sit there and go chi ch ch ch ch ch ch
					ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch
					ch ch. I don't know what it was.<br>
					Was it a bird? Was it a bat? Was it a bug? I don't know. But his one job was to bother me and camera
					wife. Camera wife, did you sleep good?<br>
					No, but it was still a a good night. Yeah, guys. Last night we had one of the best times we've ever
					had together as husband and wife. We were out in this field and we were just talking for 2 or 3
					hours. I don't even know. We talked until like 12:00 in the morning probably. And it was just really
					good to talk with my beautiful little wife. We talked about a lot of deep and nice things. But we
					didn't sleep very good. We're going to make breakfast now. Come on, camera wife. Come on, baby.
					Hello guys, I found this cool feather and put it in my hat and I think it looks super cool. I'm
					making some turkey sausage and we're going to make some eggs and put it on a bagel. Make a delicious
					breakfast sandwich. So, I'll show you guys in a minute what our breakfast looks like. I have
					something I wanted to ask you guys if you'd do me a favor.<br>
					So, I'm going to put my my Instagram down in the description. I'd like you guys to follow me on
					Instagram if you would please. And there's a lot of reasons why I'd like you to do that.
					First of all, you get to see exclusive pictures, behind the scenes things of our adventures, like
					when we were making the Porsche. But most importantly, guys, I want to get the Instagram big so I
					could use it as a business account and start reaching out to people and saying things like, "Hey, do
					you want to collaborate? Hey, can we film in your restaurant? Hey, let's do this, guys.<br>
					The more followers I have, the more legitimate and real it makes us look and the more likely people
					will be to help us out and be able to make awesome content. So guys, if we have an Instagram that's
					as big as the YouTube channel, like I said, when we go somewhere, I could write the people at this
					restaurant and say, "Hey, can we do a video in your restaurant and I'll tag you on my Instagram
					where I have 100,000 followers? Please guys help me to grow the Instagram. I used to use it as a
					place to put short videos mainly in Spanish, but now I'm going to make it my personal account and
					hopefully we could use it to really start growing the channel and use it as a tool to make some
					better content. Okay guys, breakfast bagel, egg, cheese, turkey sausage. I love cheese. Put extra
					cheese on mine. This isn't as fancy as the borch, but still looks like a pretty good breakfast.<br>
					Okay, guys. I guess that's everything for today. My husband is just being so good like cleaning and
					getting ready. I would say I didn't have to do almost anything. He cooks and he clean and prepare
					the tin and everything.<br>
					What did you do?
					Um, just to be pretty. He said that.
					But you filmed me.
					Oh, yeah.
					Good camera wife.
					I I enjoy it that much.<br>
					Guys, thank you so much for being on this special adventure with us. I had a lot of fun. Did you
					have fun?
					Oh, it was so great.
					Okay, guys. Hope you enjoyed this video.<br>
					Leave me a comment. Tell me what you thought. Appreciate every single one of you being here with us.
					See you in the next video.
