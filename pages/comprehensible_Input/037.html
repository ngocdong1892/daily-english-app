					Hello my friends hello again today today we're going to practice our English with world news okay I
					just listened to something incredible and for that reason I decided to make this video to share it
					with you guys okay I listened to a speech a speech given by the president of Argentina Javier mle
					okay and as soon as I heard the speech I messed my hair up and put my glasses like this to be like
					him because this guy man this was an incredible speech okay uh this the speech he gave was truly
					awesome now I don't know enough about this man to say whether I like him or don't whether I support
					him or not whether I think he's a good president or not so tell me your opinion down below
					especially if you are Argentinian but from what I heard in this speech I was like wow this is great
					this guy is speaking truth and he does not care about who knows it okay he is not intimidated by
					these people who will try to sh shut him up he's telling the truth for his people and for the people
					of the world and that's awesome all right so I'm going to summarize for you guys what Javier M just
					said in front of a a world economic Forum where all the leaders of the world come to discuss how
					they're going to screw us over the normal people basically so what did Javier M say that I thought
					was so incredible well he started his speech by saying that the west and what he means by the West
					is the continent of America North and South and Europe okay that is considered the west and he
					started his speech by saying that the West is in danger he said that the people who are supposed to
					be protecting our Western values and ways of life are actually destroying it and they are destroying
					it by trying to implement communism or what they're calling nowadays socialism he then explained how
					many years ago Argentina was a world power and one of the wealthiest countries on planet Earth and
					after Decades of Communism they went way down on the list and they became I think he said 140 on the
					list that is way down there he then talks about how every single case of where a country adopted
					communism has failed and has done nothing but bring poverty to its people and make them more poor he
					then promotes a style of government called libertarianism which he defines as the right to life
					liberty and freedom and respect for personal private property so to summarize that in simpler words
					it is a limited government that allows its people to thrive by operating their own businesses and
					not destroying their businesses by too many laws and regulations and too heavy taxes he says that in
					this type of system a Libertarian government a successful businessman or business person is a hero
					because the only way to become successful in this system is by offering the highest quality product
					or service at the best price so therefore a successful business person is contributing so much to
					society by means of jobs by means of affordable quality products and therefore they are a hero he
					then discussed how the same leaders who are pushing socialism are pushing other ideas to divide the
					people to divide us for example creating problems between different races creating problems between
					men and women and he called these people out to their faces he was speaking directly to these people
					in this audience the people who are sitting in this place listening to him are the same people who
					are pushing these ideas that are destroying in his words destroying the West he said that they have
					corrupted common sense in the west by corrup in media both social media and television by corrupting
					what they teach in schools and universities and by corrupting International organizations guys he
					said this at an international organization incredibly he then invited the rest of the world to join
					him and Argentina in reclaiming Freedom limited government and the freedom of the everyday people to
					thrive he then told business people around the world that they are the ones who help Society by
					creating jobs providing quality and Affordable Services and by making the economy Thrive and
					therefore lowering poverty he says that these people are the ones who are helping Society not the
					politicians and he referred to them as parasites who are living off of the government he said they
					do not care about the well-being of the people they only care about keeping their power and their
					privileges he's said that a bigger government is not the solution it is actually the problem itself
					and he ended his speech with these beautiful words my friends all right guys that is my summary of
					what Javier M said in his speech at the uh International economic Forum in front of all the people
					who are in favor of the socialism and pushing these ideas on everybody else he stood up in front of
					them and said these things he called them out to their faces I think it was beautiful I still don't
					know what I think about this guy I'm going to have to learn more about him but I was very impressed
					by this speech so I hope you guys understood this well maybe learned some new good vocabulary in
					English and I hope every single one of you continues working on your goals and chasing your dream
					dreams
