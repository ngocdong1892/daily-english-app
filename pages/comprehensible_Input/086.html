					foreign [Music] foreign [Music] nice to meet you my name is Pedro Gomez I am from Colombia like your
					girlfriend why I want a learning English okay I have many reasons to learn English path three Mains
					reasons are the first one I want to be able to listen to music rock music in specific Guns and Roses
					for example and Metallica second and I want to meet people around the world all countries possible
					and that is important for me I want to meet all countries really and the third reason and for me is
					the most important in that moment In This Moment sorry it's because I will go to live in Malta in
					one month and really I need learn English because I need a speak with people in English all the time
					every day all day and I need improved very fast my English thank you I am grateful with your Channel
					with for your videos I enjoy your Channel and I want to send you a big hug for you for your son for
					your girlfriend which is especially okay everybody Pedro wow I think that your English is great I
					think you're doing a great job and you're going to do well when you go to Malta okay so keep on
					going keep on practicing and you will be just fine my friendos aqui okay so today Hoy today I am
					going to explain to you guys the words though thought tough through and thorough okay now I I know
					that these words are difficult for you guys okay these words are tough these words are tough for you
					guys because they look they look like the same word they look like the same word okay so here let's
					do a little bit of shadowing shadowing okay so for you those of you guys who do not know what
					shadowing is shadowing is when I say something and then I give you guys a little bit of space to say
					it after me okay so that you guys can work on your pronunciation okay so the word though though
					means anke and I'll use it in a sentence later but right now let's practice saying okay though
					though okay and I want you guys to tell me Tell Me Down Below which one of these words is the
					hardest for you okay okay the next word thought thought means okay thought thought thought now tough
					tough means okay so these words can be tough they could be tough for Spanish speakers to learn tough
					tough tough okay the next word through a Travis through through [Music] and the last word thorough
					means exhaustivo thorough thorough thorough okay so they're not that bad right so we've got though
					thoughts thought tough tough through through and thorough thorough okay guys so I want you guys to
					tell me down below did you like this little shadowing exercise do you think it was useful foreign if
					you guys you like this this little shadowing part tell me and I'll do more videos like this so you
					guys can practice your pronunciation okay tell me what words are difficult for you guys and I can
					make a video pronouncing these words and giving you guys some space to say it after me so you could
					practice pronunciation like a native okay so now now I will use these words in sentences though I
					use my Spanish much more often I love the French language though the first time that I had a thought
					in Spanish I knew that I was bilingual la primerives learning a new language can be tough tough
					difficile can be tough but it is worth it we walked through a Travis we walked through the snow to
					get home you can look through a window or you can walk through a door when I made this video I tried
					to give you guys a thorough explanation of how to use these words thorough exhaustible okay guys
					though thought tough through thorough piece of cake guys piece of cake fussy okay and also Pedro he
					asked me when he sent me his video he sent me an email Correo electronico and he asked me for some
					advice to how he can speak more fluently okay okay so something that I used in the past with my
					Spanish and with my French is when I'm by myself cuando esue solo in my car driving walking around
					okay when I'm by myself you can ask yourself questions okay so think of a question that you would
					ask in an interview okay Pedro something that you would use in your job okay I don't know what job
					you're going to do but think about something that you will do in your job okay or something that you
					would ask a co-worker somebody who you will work with Okay for example I would ask myself Kyle what
					do you like about the French language [Music] okay so I would I would think of a question and then I
					would tell them the answer okay so hmm I like the French language because I feel smart when I speak
					French okay or at the end of a day I would just talk to myself about how my day was okay I would
					think about how my day was and say it to myself to practice okay so hmm what did I do today okay
					okay well I went to the gym I worked out okay I worked out I went for a run all right I cooked some
					food cook some food all right that's another thing you could do Pedro at the end of your day at the
					end of every day at night before you go to bed talk about your Day okay sit down by yourself and
					just talk just talk so it's always best if you can practice with a native speaker but there is
					nothing wrong with practicing with yourself okay I have done it a hundred times and I think it could
					help you guys too so is pronto
