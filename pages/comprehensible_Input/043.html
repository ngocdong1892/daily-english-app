					Kk alejandro thank you very much for being with me today and today we are going to speak in three
					languages if there is no problem english spanish and french little french my french is rusty so to
					begin with how many languages do you speak well well look it depends on what one considers speaking
					languages because let's say there are languages in which I express myself more easily and others
					that I understand but I don't express myself very well and others that I can read with the
					dictionary so let's say the languages that I speak best let's say at a native level are Spanish,
					Russian and Italian and I also think that I speak French quite well and English does not do that
					also for various reasons I learned Polish and Bulgarian and these are two languages that I
					understand perfectly but since I have no practice then I cannot say that I express myself fluently
					in these languages and I understand well and I read without any problem in Portuguese the same thing
					I don't have practice for which I don't know how since I haven't spoken it for 15 years and then
					more in color and now I'm learning Greek and I really like modern Greek and with the active one and
					modern Greek you can read with the dictionary it's fine but I still have a lot to do to start
					understanding it too while I listen to everything let's say I have several languages but at
					different levels of course of course it is difficult to keep everyone at a very high level so you
					speak Russian and Spanish as a native is that you have a father from Russia and another from Spain
					yes yes yes I am half Russian and half Spanish my father was Russian my mother is Spanish and so
					since I was little I spoke both languages I spoke them with my grandparents and with my friends
					Spanish I say no but we grew up with Russia so yes that's why the two languages did not go what you
					think of Vladimir Putin no kidding we are not going to talk about politics my interest opinion is
					going to be very banal it is one thing it is a curse for russia I hope its reign ends as soon as
					possible it is one the situation they were following is very tragic and the bad thing is that there
					was no good solution to that so yes, despite the fact that I am half Russian and of course I support
					the Ukrainians in this conflict there is really no other option for me at least not of course and
					that was your third language well let's say that I started studying at school I started studying in
					English with a good teacher at school but at school you study badly let's continue foreigners
					normally it's studying in classes of 30 people you'll understand what it's not about building and
					nothing well then I started with one with a teacher when university I started to study Italian and
					French simultaneously and since now I have been living here in Italy for almost 8 years well Italian
					is also converted I don't dare to say that he is a native Italian but I hope so after eight years
					old and being a native speaker in Spanish we also help you yes yes yes no look at me from this point
					of view I was very lucky because thanks to the Russian I was able to learn Polish from Bulgarian
					without any problem Because they are Slavic languages, although they have a lot in common, no more
					than I thought before I began to study them in Spanish, as it is related to French, Italian and
					Portuguese, and to other languages, which is not good, but they do exist, so let's not say that I
					had much less problems in learning Italian French no compared to other people who do not speak a
					language of Latin origin yes Italian then especially Italian yes they were quite easy languages for
					me. maybe that's why you can read well in portuguese also exactly yes but me too later in the second
					year with i was in the second year of university and i found that i wanted to learn portuguese i was
					interested i also found a teacher and i spent two years studying with which let's say that I have no
					problem understanding it when I read it and also when I don't even listen to it the problem is that
					of course I have never had the opportunity to speak I have never gone to Portugal or any of the
					Portuguese-speaking countries well then I don't know no I know I don't know what my Portuguese would
					be like if I had to speak it clearly, it's also very different in Portugal than in Brazil now I
					don't know if it's more, come on, the difference between the Portuguese of Portugal and the
					Portuguese of Brazil is greater than, for example, in my opinion not that the difference that exists
					between the Spanish of Spain and the Spanish of several Spanish- speaking countries and that
					difference is also quite large but the Portuguese speaks even more clearly s many languages some
					very very very well some you can understand you have a favorite language and look well no I don't
					think you don't know why why in each language I find I like to find unique things in languages and
					even if there are two languages that they are very similar to each other not in any case you can
					find in each of those languages something absolutely unusual not like for example what do I know in
					Spanish and in Portuguese there is the future subjunctive but in Spanish it is hardly used and in
					portuguese it is something that i know is not the thing used quite used no so i am fascinated by
					that for example in the greek language as well as in the bulgarian the infinitive does not exist so
					they have to spend time inventing constructions inventing ways of expressing the same ideas without
					the infinitive and it is an exceptional thing or for example also study Finnish which has 14 cases
					Spanish and neither does English the languages most of the languages they study do not have n In any
					case, the Russian, the Slavic languages except the Bulgarian have six or seven cases, the end of
					this one of 14, so that, as it was for me, was a whole journey in that language, not to understand
					what is the use of so many cases and how the used ones, so let's say that a language or I love
					Spanish or Italian, let's say that it has always been a love but in any case in each language there
					is something that fascinates me and that makes me fall in love with that language also if I
					completely agree I think that each language it's like a new adventure and getting to see new and
					interesting things like that and also meet new people which is amazing for me and I would love to be
					able to ask you that in Russian but if I can't say in Spanish can you tell me a little bit about
					what it was like growing up in Moscow look It was quite particular because I grew up in the late to
					late 80's in the 90's and it was a very tough period in Russian history with the dismantling of the
					Soviet Union with all the political problems. social economic cos that existed then was very
					particular no I always tell all that my experience that I had in 1990 when I spent two hours waiting
					in line to buy bread and then and the other things to buy you had to queue even longer then that
					let's say that it was quite a hard experience there were even two attempts 222 coups one afternoon
					in 1993 one afternoon I looked out the window of my house and I see the tankers passing under my
					windows and the next day I turn on the TV and I see that those same tanks are shooting at the
					parliament building let's not say that of course there were also beautiful things not everyone does
					not have very varied experiences in their lives but the truth is that it was very particular and
					another thing that people have just said I think that of my generation those of us who grew up at
					that time have and at least I don't have I don't want to speak for everyone no but I have that what
					the Let's take a somewhat pessimistic view of the general if everything goes well it seems
					suspicious to me and something has to happen not that the collapse is not this happiness this
					situation is good then when there are problems and I automatically think well that's life it doesn't
					have to be like this and I think it is something determined by that childhood experience or living
					in a country that is collapsing a little more like it was in the Soviet Union so it's sad but maybe
					you have a more realistic view of life because I haven't commented well many people don't know that
					there are real problems in the world you know i want this new iphone but no they have never had to
					wait for bread or things like that well yes that's why for people like the ones i just mentioned i
					think when something arrives hard in life it's not harder to get over it because they haven't had
					this experience that's why from this point of view maybe I don't feel even luckier because I well if
					things go wrong that's the way it is life no yes of course ok now let's go in english ok ok so you
					started learning english at school but then why did you pursue it to a higher level and look it
					wasn't a continuous process I started at school and then I didn't have the opportunity because I
					worked with other languages. with Spanish and Italian with French and less with English but when I
					was 28 years old now I am 40 so it was not long ago that I started working at Moscow University and
					I was a teacher so I had to read a lot in English, articles, politicians, international relations
					For me it was a way to improve my English. I remember 10 years ago I went to California to a
					conference with my colleagues and I was invited, for me it was a problem. At this time I was able to
					read no problems but when I heard English I was in trouble . I started listening to someone at the
					conference, and the first 5 minutes everything was fine. but then I felt tired and I stopped
					understanding it was very difficult and it was only thanks to my work as a translator that I was
					finally able to understand and speak it better I know that I speak better Spanish or Russian or
					Italian however I can express the things that I think in English and my English is much better today
					than 10 years ago congratulations it's amazing. your accent is interesting I don't know if it's
					Russian or Spanish. It's weird when I speak any language that isn't Spanish or Russian I think I
					speak it with a Spanish accent but someone told me I don't remember who someone who speaks English
					said I think you're from Central Europe maybe German or Polish or something and I'm neither polish
					or german i think i have a mix between russian and spanish accent you can hear i am not american nor
					english nor australian i can hide my identity if we met and only speak english i would not think you
					are from spain or russia something in europe you probably think english It is a difficult language
					to learn, yes, yes, I have heard many people say English is a very easy language. I think they say
					that because they start studying at school so it's like when you have contact with this language
					when you are 10 or 8 years old you will get used to it even if you don't speak it well but imagine
					someone who is 30 or 40 years old and has never heard no English and this person has to study, how
					can you explain that if you write KIND you say kind (caind) and if you write WIND you say wind, why?
					for example if you write AWE it is awww, why? From this point of view, I remember my grandmother
					saying "The British write Manchester and read Liverpool? It is very difficult to read in English
					when you have no idea of the phonetic rules. Also for me the difficult thing is phonetics. Until now
					when I see a word for the first time and I can understand what it means because like 70% of English
					vocabulary comes from French or Latin so it's easy to understand if you speak French or another Neo
					Latin language but I have no idea how I should say it and that's the hard thing about English and in
					my opinion also learning to understand spoken English. and especially with young people speaking
					with slang I imagine it is difficult my girlfriend is Colombian and sometimes we are reading and she
					sees a word and she says why is that so! there is no reason. I think there are millions of people
					who think the same so that 's why I try to make videos to help Spanish speakers learn English and I
					can imagine how difficult it is so I try to make it a little easier for them it's a great idea ok
					now in French it's okay? why do you speak french? I started learning when I was 16 I don't know,
					I've always liked French, for me it's writing, culture and I wanted to read the great French writers
					and that's why I started, I was very lucky with a French teacher, a woman who wasn't very old but
					had a lot of knowledge of the French culture and then I started reading in French and thanks to
					reading in French I got a good level to continue learning about French culture and after university
					I went to France a few times because my sister has lived in France for 6 years I had the opportunity
					to talk to French women but above all I speak French because I am fascinated and I enjoy it very
					much. I think you speak like the people of Paris, and your sister also speaks many languages?
					if she speaks Spanish and Russian and very well French, English, Polish, Italian. She is older than
					me and I think my passion for languages was influenced by her . She started learning Italian and
					then Polish. She told me hey I have learned and if you want to learn I can show you how. and so i
					started with polish and italian i think now she is learning persian her arabic with an app like
					dueling she also has a great passion for languages! It is a family of polyglots. You think that
					French is an important language in the world . That depends on where you are. In Europe, there are
					many francophone countries . It is important in Africa, but French is not as important as it was a
					hundred years ago. in the 19th century the russian ministers of foreign affairs use french for
					relations with the french because it was easier they speak french so well that even when they were
					speaking russian they do it with a french accent at this time the french language was number one in
					everything the international count today is not the same but it is still a culture that maintains a
					very high level I love the French language and I would love to speak in French all day but because
					we only have a few more minutes I would like to ask you in Spanish do you have some advice for
					someone who is learning English or any language as a piece of advice learn well or use your time
					well look let's say these are very general things no the first thing is that my own experience tells
					me don't learn a language if you like it if you don't like it well and you make an effort to learn
					it is not going to be torture the best better than no better is [ __ ] a language that fascinates
					you to learn it no I personally have never learned any language out of necessity that we would all
					say that I have studied those studied because I was interested in another thing is to try to
					understand what helps you most to learn the language for example I am a person who believes that he
					prefers reading to other methods of study of languages, no, but I know that there are many people
					who prefer to listen and müller does not, so you have to choose well the methods that you like the
					most in order to move forward and, above all, listen to yourself and try to transform the study
					process into something that you really enjoy not one thing but what you have to do even if you don't
					feel like doing it then that's the main thing and well another thing I think is quite obvious is
					perseverance no I mean it's better to learn the language than spend half an hour sir every three
					days I have to do four hours today and what do I know and four hours in two months does not have to
					be a constant thing that I think is fundamental that it is perfect I agree every day I would even do
					something a little bit yes I know better a little bit every day not that it's 15 minutes not in 10
					minutes 15 minutes no but I hope it's every time you do a more perfect step every day it was very
					interesting talking to you again and thank you very much for helping me Thank you, thank you, it has
					been a very nice experience and I really liked speaking three languages one after the other, it is a
					great gesture
