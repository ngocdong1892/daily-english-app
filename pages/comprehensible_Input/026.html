					Are you ready to learn some real life English with comprehensible input? Well, good, because today
					we're going to improve our English with a conversation between two native English speakers. One from
					the United States and one from Britain. In this video, I share the story of how I learned fluent
					Spanish in one year with comprehensible input.
					Let's go. Hello and welcome to another discussion video. I'm here today with Kyle from Pensando.
					So Kyle has his own YouTube channel. Um hello Kyle. How are you today?
					>> Hello James. I'm I'm doing very well today and I appreciate your time. I'm happy to have this
					conversation with a fellow content creator. We are on the same mission so it's nice to work together
					and hopefully help the world learn some English.
					Yeah, we are kind of doing similar things with our YouTube channel. Um, but before we talk about
					like English actually, I wanted to talk about your own language learning journey.
					So, at the moment, I would say I'm quote unquote learning French, but I I am fluent in Spanish. That
					was the first language I ever learned was Spanish. So, I've studied several languages. I've got
					quite a bit of time studying French under my belt a couple years now, but I've also dabbled in some
					Portuguese as well, but I'm definitely very comfortable in Spanish. I wouldn't say I'm comfortable
					in the other languages just yet.
					>> Nice. Okay. So, you think that you're pretty comfortable, pretty fluent in Spanish. So, in that
					case, how did you learn Spanish? Like can you tell me from the very beginning stages when you knew
					like no Spanish, zero Spanish until now like how did you manage this because it's difficult to learn
					a second language. So I'm sure people will be interested to hear how you did this.
					>> So it is very very interesting because I'm not sure about where you grew up but where I grew up
					in the the Midwest of the United States you know we have immigrants. There's a lot of Mexicanameans
					here, but for the most part, people just speak English. And you know, you don't meet people that
					speak two or three languages like you might in some other countries. So, it is very unique. Uh,
					among all my friends and family, I don't know anybody else that is fluent in a second language, let
					alone a third. So, my my journey has been a bit of a long one. You know, I I went to high school
					with a lot of Mexican kids and I really, you know, you hear them speaking Spanish and being around
					it, you wish you could understand, right? You you you see and hear your friends speaking Spanish and
					you you're lost. You you wish you could understand. So, I I tried the traditional methods, you know?
					I I bought a book from Barnes & Noble that said it was a very easy way to learn Spanish, and, you
					know, I couldn't even get through it. It was so boring, so difficult.
					So, the tra traditional methods just never worked for me. You know, I've tried Dolingo, Babel, and
					these apps, they have their place. You know, you could learn a little bit of vocabulary, but I'm of
					the belief that you could do Dolingo for 2 years every day and you would probably still struggle to
					have a very basic conversation.
					So, it all really started for me when I was about 27. my real learning started and I was around a
					Mexican family. I was starting to spend a lot of time around these people. I had met somebody and
					was spending a lot of time with their family and the family did not speak English. So here I am
					going to parties, going to dinners and I can only communicate with one person there and there's a
					whole group. You know, imagine me in a party with a 100 Mexicans and I'm the only one that doesn't
					speak Spanish. That's some good motivation, right?
					>> So, >> I mean that's that Yeah, that's really good motivation. Um, I just want just want to
					clarify. So, you started you you don't you didn't obviously there was Spanish around you, but you
					didn't learn would you say you didn't really learn anything from your surroundings like from the
					kids at school? Do you think you learned any Spanish from them? The >> the bad words and the
					insults. That's about it.
					I was just going to say I completely agree with you about Dolingo. Okay. I think that you're right.
					You could spend you said two years. I think you could spend a lifetime uh using Dualingo, completing
					all your Dualingo streaks and still not be able to actually have a conversation in the language. I
					think so.
					>> Dualingo is just a language game, right?
					It's a game based on a language. It's not like really what you do to to learn a language. It's just
					something extra.
					So Kyle then, so if none of that worked, if all of those things that the traditional book that you
					bought, Dualingo, Babel, if none of it worked, then what did you do to make it finally click with
					Spanish? Well, so like I said, I'm I'm surrounded by these people speaking Spanish. You know, I'm
					trying to use Babel and Dolingo. It's not helping. And like I said, I went to a party with about a
					hundred people speaking Spanish. And that was the last straw. I decided right then and there, I'm
					going to learn this language no matter what. And that's an important thing, making that decision.
					That's huge. We could talk about that a little later, but let me answer your question.
					So because of that determination I had that I'm going to learn I searched on YouTube how to really
					learn a language, how to learn Spanish and I found a YouTube channel that absolutely changed my life
					dreaming Spanish and it was incredible. I started watching the absolute super beginner videos and
					Pablo who is probably my favorite YouTuber ever because I've watched so many hours of him. He's he's
					drawing and speaking so slowly and you before you know it, you don't even realize it, but you're
					understanding and it's all starting to click. So, it all really started to make sense for me once I
					discovered comprehensible input, which is what Pablo's channel, Dreaming Spanish, is all about. That
					was like a before and after, not only in my language learning journey, but in my life because
					languages have been such a huge part of my life.
					How many hours do you think you watched?
					Like do you have any idea like have you been tracking the number of hours that you watched Spanish
					comprehensible input?
					>> So at that time I wasn't keeping track and I wasn't a member on uh the Dreaming Spanish site
					which is awesome because it tracks your hours for you. I wish I was.
					But when I was at first just watching the YouTube videos, the free ones, and I don't know exactly
					how many, but to give you an idea, 2 hours a day on a a slower day, sometimes three. Um, I was just
					binging, binging, binging. Everything I was watching on my phone was Dreaming Spanish. And then, you
					know, once you get to a certain level, you could start watching real content made for natives as
					comprehensible input. So, it started with hours every day of dreaming Spanish, just one after the
					other, working my way from the super beginner all the way up to the advanced, hundreds of hours. I,
					you know, hundreds at least.
					>> You were doing 2 hours a day, right? Um, did you not get bored? Did you not get bored listening
					to Spanish 2 hours every single day?
					>> Well, you know, that's the other thing about comprehensible input. If the person that's making it
					is doing it right, it should be fun. It should be entertaining. It should be like you're sitting
					there with a friend who speaks that language. I was never bored because, you know, Dreaming Spanish
					has so many different topics. No matter what you like, you're going to find something enjoyable for
					you. And that's what I try to recreate on my channel and I know you as well are doing on English
					sponge with so many different creators, so many different topics. But that's the thing, reading a
					book, learning grammar, memorizing vocabulary, that would be so boring for 2 hours a day. But the
					upside, the plus of comprehensible input is I don't think you get bored nearly as fast as the
					traditional learning methods. And that's a number one comment that I get on my channel is, "Wow, I
					watched this whole video. I never got bored." And people are so surprised that they could be
					learning and having fun at the same time. But that's the beauty of it.
					You've used basically comprehensible input from like almost a complete beginner level all the way up
					to what you are now which is like basically fluent in Spanish.
					Like how is your Spanish like do you think that using comprehensible input has been like given you
					better results than maybe other people who have used traditional methods? Do you think that um do
					you think the end result for you has been good using this method?
					Absolutely, without a doubt. And you know, the benefit of comprehensible input versus say somebody
					who took a very extensive college course, you know, I'm sure that after 4 years of a very extensive
					college course course and Spanish literature, things like that, you'll be speaking. But the thing
					is, I learned my Spanish the way that people actually speak it in the streets. You know, with Pablo,
					I was learning how Spaniards speak. He has Mexican speakers on there. I was learning how they speak.
					I learned how the Colombians speak. So, it it's really a beautiful thing this conversation right now
					if somebody is using it as comprehensible input.
					They're seeing how somebody from the Midwest United States speaks versus somebody with your accent.
					So, it's it's it's really incredible. And you know, I was having conversations after a year, a solid
					year of comprehensible input. I was having deep, good conversations. And that's that's unheard of in
					traditional learning.
					>> That's really amazing actually after one year of studying. Let's I'll put studying in like
					quotation marks because it's like is it studying you know? Um just one year. I mean like I have as
					an I've been an English teacher like teaching classes for like six or seven years and I know like
					Chinese students and well students from all over the world who have who study English for like 6
					years at school like using traditional methods and by the time they finish their six years of
					English um they still can't hold a basic conversation after that time and yet here you are like
					after one year having actual conversations with with native speakers. It's just like kind of crazy
					the difference um between the two methods. Now there are other factors like children at school may
					be less motivated. You certainly have a point that it there is the motivation factor, but if you are
					motivated and you want to learn a language because you genuinely want to learn, which is the case
					for most adults watching this kind of content, they really want to learn whether it's, you know,
					they want to speak with extended family, in-laws, their job, they want to move to a different
					country. Generally, the people I see on my channel are highly motivated. And when you have that
					mindset and then you start just devouring the content, the results speak for themselves. They come
					really quick.
					Honestly, >> when I see people on English sponge who are like commenting on every single video,
					every new upload. Um I know that these people are going to get great results, right? Cuz they're
					just consuming content every single day. And to me, that's what it takes to learn a language is you
					have to be doing it like every day. doing.
					>> You were doing two hours a day.
					>> Honestly, I I with Spanish, I've reached quite a good level of Spanish. I honestly I was only
					listening to about 30 minutes a day. Like, it didn't take it took me longer than you. Okay. It took
					me more time because I spend less time each day uh listening to comprehensible input. But seriously,
					half an hour a day will get you pretty damn good results with comprehensible input. The the other
					thing I like with comprehensible input is that you don't have to think about what you're going to do
					on that day. Like with other methods, you kind of waste time like trying to decide what you're going
					to do. It's like, shall I do some grammar today?
					Shall I maybe read this book? Shall I speak or whatever? But if it's comprehensible input, there's
					no there's no doubt. you just go straight to the the input and you just start listening with no time
					wasted. Um, which I is why I think it's also really good for really busy people like a busy
					professionals who don't have that much uh free time to learn, you know.
					>> Definitely. Yeah. You know, I've got uh I've got people on the channel that comment and say, you
					know, I I'm a truck driver. I listen to you while I'm on the road. or a lady in I believe Saudi
					Arabia told me the other day that she listens to me while she does her chores around the house. And
					that's the cool thing, you know, you could you could go for a walk and listen. You can do it while
					you're doing something else and use that time to learn as well as get your chores done. It's Yeah,
					it's the way for a busy individual to learn a language in my opinion.
					So Kyle, like at this stage, like where is your Spanish? You say that you think you're fluent,
					right? But like how do you know? How do you know that you're fluent? And like how do you know what
					level you are? And and like how do you know you're not just sort of like lying to yourself and
					actually you're still more like an intermediate student? And how can how can you tell that? And when
					did you realize that you felt like really fluent in Spanish?
					>> Well, you know, I have Colombian in-laws, so there's no faking that. Uh, and you know, I've been
					to Colombia. I had to go through the airport by myself, all in Spanish. That's a pretty good test.
					But the the real test is when you're listening to native speakers in real life, face to face, no
					subtitles, they're speaking so fast, and you're not translating anymore. You're just thinking and
					understanding, and it's it's coming at you as information instead of words as in a foreign language.
					Um, you know, I'm not claiming that my Spanish is perfect. I make mistakes all the time. Sometimes
					my dear Spanish- speakaking friends like to laugh when I, you know, I say a a word that should be
					feminine gender. I'll use the masculine gender or something like that. But it's all fun. It's all
					love, you know. So, I could watch any show I want on Netflix. I could watch movies. I read uh full
					novels in Spanish. So, that's another thing. Making mistakes doesn't determine if you're fluent or
					not. Being able to share special moments with somebody in that language, having deep conversations,
					that's my determining factor of if you're fluent or not. And I've done that with many people from
					all over the world. So that's how I tell about myself that I'm fluent. You know, sometimes I I don't
					speak Spanish as much as I'd like to because my wife is Colombian.
					she'll speak Spanish and I'll speak English and we we just understand each other completely. So, we
					just speak in the most comfortable way. So, sometimes my Spanish will get a little rusty until we
					get around our friends and stuff, but I I feel fully comfortable handling myself in Spanish.
					>> So, actually, judging by what you said, it sounds to me like you do have like a C1 advanced level
					of Spanish or higher, right? If you are fully understanding native speakers with no subtitles, if
					you are reading novels in Spanish, like full novels, you're definitely an advanced speaker of the
					language, right?
					There's there's no doubt. I'm for my my own Spanish, I'm more like B2. So, at the B2 upper
					intermediate level, I do still need subtitles to understand people, and I cannot read a full novel
					in in Spanish. I can try, but it is a bit of a struggle. And and that's kind of the difference
					between like B2 and like C1 where you are, right? And I do hope to be able to reach your level of
					Spanish uh soon, hopefully in the next five or 6 months.
					How has it changed your life to learn another language? Like how is your life different now when you
					couldn't speak Spanish to now that you can? Have things changed a lot in generally in your life from
					this?
					>> My life has changed so much. Languages have given me so much pleasure, so much confidence, so
					many new experiences. Now I can go to the party and not just sit by myself feeling lost, you know?
					Now I can go uh spend time with my in-laws in Bukaramanga and Colombia and have that nice dinner and
					speak, you know, and be part of the group. And my wife is Colombian, like I said, so that is one
					huge thing that changed, you know, in my life from learning Spanish. And when we first met, her
					English was very basic.
					So the first 6 months of our relationship were almost entirely in Spanish. So I think that tells you
					my life has changed quite a bit from learning this language.
					>> So actually if you had not found dreaming Spanish does that mean that you would and and if you
					had not found comprehensible input does that mean that you would not have met your wife? Would you
					say >> 100% if it was not for Dreaming Spanish, you know, my case specifically, but comprehensible
					input in general, I would not have been able to go on that first date with my wife because she
					couldn't speak and have a full conversation in English. So, one of my my goals as a YouTuber is to
					speak with Pablo from Dreaming Spanish and tell him how much his work has changed my life and how
					much I appreciate it.
					>> That is actually a crazy story. I do hope that like English sponge can help a couple get married
					one day. That would be a really cool uh cool thing.
					So Kyle, what is what is your YouTube channel? What are you doing with your with your own YouTube
					channel? Pensando English.
					>> Okay, so my YouTube channel is Pensando.
					And for anybody who doesn't speak Spanish, that literally is thinking thinking English. And when I
					started that channel, I was basically just trying to help Spanish speakers. So I was doing probably
					90% of my speaking in English and then I would clarify a little bit here and there in Spanish.
					But now it has grown and grown and grown and it's 100% in English. So, we're reaching a much more
					worldwide audience now. And really what I do is comprehensible input, but what I use for the input
					is my own life, my own adventures, you know, my own hobbies. I show people the life of somebody here
					in the United States and just try and share the culture. Any interesting thing that I do in my life
					will likely be on my channel. So, I've lately I've been cooking dishes from all over the world and
					showing people all the vocabulary and people are really loving seeing their cultures represented.
					So, it's it's English, it's culture, it's it's my life vlogs, and we're having uh a good deal of
					success lately. So, I'm I'm really pleased with the four 4 and 1/2 years of work I've put in with
					the results that we're finally getting.
					Yeah, I I think that you deserve it, right? Because you've been making videos for a long time and
					only recently it seems like people have started to notice uh your channel and I also think that only
					recently people have started to find out about that you can learn through comprehensible input. Like
					I think when you started 4 years ago like nobody had really heard of it probably people could not
					even understand what what your videos were about right when you said comprehensible input. Yeah. I
					mean on English sponge we got lots of different um people like you Kyle uh with making
					comprehensible input videos and I I think that yours are probably some of the best on there. Right.
					We've got some good creators, but yours are every time I go to your channel. Usually I see something
					which is like really good. So, uh yeah, thanks for making awesome videos for that uh that we can
					help to share.
					>> Well, I I appreciate that very much, but you know, like you said, it's just now picking up. I I
					am far from a new YouTuber. People think I'm a new YouTuber, but what they don't see is I've had
					four and a half years of practice and hard work. And that's why, you know, maybe I seem very
					comfortable on the camera because I've sat here in front of this camera thousands of times.
					So, with hard work, results come. And that goes for YouTube, personal goals, or definitely language
					learning.
					>> Do you have any other final words, Kyle, before we finish? Uh, I'm I'm super super happy to
					finally speak with you.
					We've been trying to get this done for two months maybe. So, I'm just very happy. I've been trying
					to share the English accent with my subscribers. I'm I'm sure they'll be pleased to see this
					conversation. and thank you for your work as well on English sponge because you know I hope one day
					I'll be seen as one of the pioneers of English comprehensible input but it's super cool to see now
					that other people are trying to make this content and you know there the movement is going in the
					right direction and I appreciate you being a part of that.
					>> Absolutely. Yeah, I appreciate you having been in so early make making videos like into the void,
					right? making comprehensible input videos into the void where nobody watches them for like two year,
					two or three years. Uh, nice.
					Thank you very much. Thank you for listening, guys. Um, we can end it there. Um, thanks for watching
					and see you in the next
