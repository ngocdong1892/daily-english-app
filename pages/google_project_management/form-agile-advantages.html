				<p id="1cf468a0-53d4-8166-a5ba-c34ef2e4fa5a" class="">Have you ever emailed someone with a question
					and ended up in a long, back-and-forth exchange due to simple follow-up questions or
					clarifications?<br />Chances are that you could have gotten the same information in less time with a
					brief conversation.<br />Agile wants to ensure that teams work together, collaborate, and help each
					other achieve the best outcomes they can.<br />Agile also values individual perspectives and
					creativity.<br />This does not mean that every team is chaotic.<br />The value just means that
					processes
					and tools should be used to facilitate and drive good project management and improved collaboration
					within the team and should never be used as a barrier to teams working well with each
					other.<br />The
					second value emphasizes working software over comprehensive documentation, meaning that teams should
					prioritize spending time working on things that actually create value, and avoid spending any more
					time
					than they really need on debating, writing, and reviewing documents.<br />Now, this value might seem
					like it only applies to software projects.<br />But just replace the term working software with
					whatever
					your project is trying to deliver.<br />Maybe the project is writing a legal brief, designing an
					office
					layout, or preparing a sales presentation.<br />Whatever your project is trying to deliver is the
					thing
					that creates value.<br />In other words, it’s more important to deliver the product the customer
					wants
					than to comprehensively document the process that you used.<br />On to the third value– customer
					collaboration over contract negotiation.<br />In Agile projects, the customer satisfaction is
					considered
					the highest priority of building a high-quality and valuable product.<br />After all, if it’s not
					valuable to the customer, then there’s little point spending time on it.<br />When the Manifesto
					discusses contracts, it refers to the official documents that require sign-off and formal agreement
					with
					the customer, such as those huge requirement documents or formal change requests.<br />Agile values
					having the freedom to collaborate with customers early and often.<br />In doing so, teams can
					quickly
					react and adapt to what customers need rather than waiting out the process of negotiating contract
					terms
					just to make a few changes or request resources.<br />There will still be contracts with Agile
					project
					management.<br />But the focus is on identifying what’s really needed and leaving space for
					collaborative, customer-focused work.<br />Agile teams are encouraged to seek out every opportunity
					to
					include the customer or stakeholder during project execution.<br />This could be presenting early
					prototypes, asking questions, or bringing them in to do some initial product testing.<br />And
					finally,
					we have the fourth value, responding to change over following a plan.<br />This last value is
					crucial to
					an Agile project.<br />As I explained in the history overview, Agile grew out of a world that was
					changing so fast that organizations couldn’t adapt and struggled to survive.<br />As a result, this
					value stresses that every Agile team needs to acknowledge that change is inevitable.<br />The
					larger,
					longer, and more complex your project is, the more uncertainty there is.<br />For many projects,
					finalizing a well-established plan at the beginning of the project will likely lead to an on-time
					delivery within budget but may run the risk of not meeting customer needs or adding maximum
					value.<br />As a project manager, the key takeaway to remember here is that the most successful
					projects
					are the ones that are able to smoothly integrate change.<br />Agile project managers still create
					and
					value their plans, but they can cope with and are able to adapt if the plans need revising at any
					time
					during the project.<br />So there you have it, the four Agile values– individuals and interactions
					over
					processes and tools, working software over comprehensive documentation, customer collaboration over
					contract negotiation, and responding to change over following a plan.<br />What’s great about Agile
					is
					that it gives us these values and also lets us find the right balance between the two
					sides.<br />You
					may have to fine-tune your project style to meet industry needs, team dynamics, and organizational
					goals
					to find the healthy balance that works for you and your team.<br />For this course, I’ve grouped the
					12
					principles into four themes.<br />These are different from the four values.<br />The four themes of
					the
					Agile principles are– value delivery, or how do Agile teams deliver highly valuable products to
					their
					customers; business collaboration, or how do Agile teams collaborate with their business partners
					and
					stakeholders to create business value to the organization and their users; team culture, or how does
					a
					team create and maintain the right interpersonal and team dynamics to deliver value for the
					customers
					and the business; and retrospectives, or how does the project learn to continuously increase
					performance
					of an organization and business.<br />As I said, I’ve grouped each of the 12 principles under these
					themes so they’re easier to learn and remember.<br />Let’s dive in.<br />The first theme is value
					delivery and includes five principles.<br />Take a few seconds to review them.<br />This theme is
					about
					delivering the work as quickly as possible.<br />And remember why?<br />So that we can get feedback
					and
					mitigate the risk that we spend too much time building the wrong thing.<br />Also, no one gets any
					value
					from your work, including your company, until you deliver it.<br />So the longer you take to
					deliver,
					the longer you wait to get revenue, and maybe the more time the competition has to get ahead of
					you.<br />These may look very software-oriented.<br />But if you replace the word software with
					deliverables or solutions, these can apply to almost any project, for example, deliver working
					solutions
					frequently.<br />See?<br />The value theme is also about simplicity.<br />How much time do you think
					it
					takes engineers to add all the buttons and features to products that ultimately end up confusing the
					user?<br />Simplicity allows a team to focus and work on the things that matter the most.<br />An
					example of this theme in action might be prioritizing getting feedback on a product prototype so you
					know which features really matter.<br />Or it might mean ensuring the team only works on approved
					features and doesn’t spend time on unnecessary ones.<br />Another example might be reserving 10% of
					the
					team’s time to work on bug-fixing or polishing a process, which should help you go faster in future
					iterations.<br />The next theme is business collaboration and includes two more
					principles.<br />Quick
					note– one of the principals uses the term “business people” to refer to those involved with things
					like
					sales, marketing, customer support, and account management.<br />We’ll use the term “developers” to
					refer to those who are involved with making and creating products.<br />OK, so we discussed customer
					collaboration during the values discussion, and here we are again.<br />Collaborating with your
					customers helps the team get critical business information immediately, allowing them to adjust and
					adapt to any new information instantly.<br />No matter if it’s realized early or late in the
					project,
					customers will get what they want to achieve their business goals.<br />You could achieve
					collaboration
					by making sure that business people work near the development team, ideally, in the same office or
					virtual space.<br />If that’s not possible, maybe co-locating a day a week, encouraging instant
					messaging, or blocking off time on your team calendars each day or week to collaborate.<br />The
					goal is
					to enable easy access between business people and developers.<br />Another example might be how you
					handle feedback and changes in priorities.<br />Rather than trying to keep the customer away from
					developers due to concerns about scope creep, create a weekly huddle where customers and business
					people
					can explore feedback and new ideas with the team.<br />This could be a great way to discover that
					one
					really valuable feature is super easy to build, whereas, another feature the users thought would be
					easy
					is actually really hard.<br />Our third theme is team dynamics and culture and includes four more
					principles.<br />Remember, the first Agile values stresses individuals and interactions over
					processes
					and tools.<br />Notice that the principles in this theme reflect that value.<br />This theme
					emphasizes
					creating an effective team culture that is inclusive, supportive, and empowering.<br />Having an
					effective team culture is essential to a project’s success.<br />These principles really boil down
					to
					making sure your team is motivated to do the right thing, feels trusted to do the right thing, has
					the
					resources and space to work closely together on their goals, and works at a sustainable
					pace.<br />An
					example of emphasizing effective team culture would be to ask the team what kind of equipment they
					need
					to do their job and then giving them those tools.<br />Another manifestation of this theme is
					letting
					teams write their own processes and templates rather than forcing them to use something from
					headquarters.<br />Teams work best when they feel like their input is valued.<br />So you, as the
					project manager, should make space for your team to engage and actively contribute to the team
					culture.<br />You’ll build trust and empower them to approach their work in a way that suits them
					best,
					which, in turn, will allow them to work more productively.<br />Finally, the fourth theme is
					retrospectives and continuous learning.<br />The last principle stands alone in this theme, so I’ll
					read
					it aloud.<br />At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective then tunes
					and
					adjusts its behavior accordingly.<br />This one sits on its own because I want to draw attention to
					how
					important it is for Agile teams to continuously learn and adapt to what’s working and what’s not
					working
					for them.<br />Teams should always be figuring out better ways to work.<br />And it’s really
					valuable to
					set this time aside after each iteration to focus entirely on how to improve.<br />In these
					sessions,
					the team can step back and consider questions like, how is the team doing?<br />Are the customers
					happy?<br />Are there processes we could optimize?<br />Are our tools working for us?<br />Are we
					following the values?<br />Are we accumulating any debt?<br />And by debt, I mean processes or
					technology that slows us down.<br />We’ve officially finished discussing the Agile
					Manifesto.<br />It’s
					amazing to think that these four values and 12 principles are the foundations of so many advances in
					project management.<br /></p>
