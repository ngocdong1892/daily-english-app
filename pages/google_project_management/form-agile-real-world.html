					of
					a project and the end product you’ll ultimately deliver, which is what holds value for the user and
					the
					customer.<br />I’m going to define the term value as it relates to project management.<br />Then
					I’ll
					share some strategies and tactics you can employ to maximize the value your team delivers.<br />The
					end
					product of a project is what provides value to the user.<br />Value could be financial benefits,
					user
					growth and engagement, or compliance adherence.<br />The term value can mean different things for
					each
					customer based on what they expect the product to accomplish.<br />The number one agile principle is
					to
					satisfy the customer by delivering valuable software.<br />You can always replace the term software
					with
					the words product or solution for non software related projects.<br />Delivering value as quickly
					and
					efficiently as possible to users is the primary reason agile came into existence.<br />The term
					value
					driven delivery means you and your team are focused on delivering a product of high value.<br />Just
					because you deliver a product, that doesn’t mean it’s valuable.<br />As I explained during the
					overview
					of agile history, there was a growing problem of project teams churning out products that weren’t
					very
					valuable.<br />This is because teams were focused on the process and weren’t taking the time to
					evaluate
					the usefulness of the product until the very end, after it had been delivered.<br />Agile redirects
					the
					team’s focus to be about the product and ensures that the process for producing the product supports
					the
					goal of delivering value.<br />How can you make sure your team is focused on value driven
					delivery?<br />Build the right thing, build the thing right, and run it right.<br />Remember, agile
					and
					Scrum evolved out of the software industry, so the terms build and run describe processes for
					building
					or running a software program, machine, or other technology.<br />You can replace the words build
					and
					run with terms like create, produce, or deliver for non software projects to describe the same
					concept.<br />Let’s break this down.<br />First and foremost, to deliver value, you have to build
					the
					right thing.<br />You can do this by making sure you really understand what your customers
					want.<br />You might ask a customer what they want, and they may say they want to build a website to
					promote their new plant service.<br />But take this one step further and ask about their
					goals.<br />Do
					they want to increase their brand recognition?<br />Do they want to get more customers?<br />Having
					a
					solution oriented conversation with your customer will help you build the right thing.<br />The
					agile
					value of individuals and interactions over processes and tools extends beyond just the team.<br />It
					refers to having those important interactions with our customers and users, too.<br />Next, you must
					build the thing right.<br />That’s lingo for ensuring that your team only builds the requested or
					approved features.<br />Working on features that aren’t necessary can lead to complexities in the
					product that don’t add any value to the users.<br />In addition, building more than you need delays
					or
					reduces your value upon delivery.<br />It also increases the risk of bugs or other issues down the
					road.<br />And finally, in addition to building the right thing and building the thing right, you
					have
					to make sure that you’re running it right.<br />To run it right means that your team has thought
					through
					how the user will interact with the product once it’s been delivered.<br />Make sure your team
					thinks
					through some of the operational tasks that will need to be addressed after the product has left the
					door.<br />Ask the following questions– how do users get support?<br />How does the product add
					value to
					users long after they initially received it?<br />And how do you make sure that new features and
					capabilities reach the existing users?<br />Building the right thing, building the thing right, and
					running it right all work together to ensure that the team creates a steady and continuous delivery
					of
					value to users throughout the life of the product.<br />Let’s consider how the Virtual Verde team
					can
					ensure that they focus on value driven delivery.<br />First, how could the Virtual Verde team ensure
					they build the right thing?<br />How do they know they’re creating something the customer really
					wants?<br />In this case, the team needs to ensure that they create a service providing the types of
					plants that customers want to buy, so they could create a survey that asked current and potential
					customers what their plant preferences are and the type of home office design they want to
					create.<br />Then they’ll use this data to update the user stories on their product
					backlog.<br />Next,
					how could the Virtual Verde team ensure they build the thing right?<br />Once the team knows what
					kinds
					of plants and designs the customer wants, how do they ensure the right processes are in place to
					deliver
					them?<br />Well, the team can secure a trusted plant vendor that carries the desired plant types and
					work with designers to make pots, vases, and other plant accessories in the different design styles
					that
					customers like.<br />The team can also communicate with marketing to make sure the types of plants
					and
					designs that customers want are prominently featured on the website and in the catalog.<br />And
					finally, how can the Virtual Verde team make sure to run it right?<br />How do they ensure customer
					satisfaction once a customer has signed up for the service?<br />How does the Virtual Verde team
					retain
					their customers long after their plants have been delivered?<br />The Virtual Verde team can send
					out
					follow-up customer satisfaction surveys that ask about their plant and design offerings, delivery
					times,
					plant quality, and other insights.<br />The team can then use this data to continually evaluate
					their
					vendors, plant and design offerings, and marketing strategy.<br />For example, the team could find
					ways
					to increase the quality of service by offering watering cans and automatic plant health systems or
					even
					free monthly gardening tips, so the user feels empowered and supported to maintain their
					plants.<br />There are many ways to maximize your team’s value delivery.<br />Building the right
					thing,
					building the thing right, and running it right all work together to ensure that the team delivers
					value
					to users.<br />[MUSIC PLAYING] As a project manager, part of your job is to help teams stay focused
					on
					delivering value.<br />A great way to do this is to build a value roadmap.<br />It’s an agile way of
					mapping out the timelines and requirements for the product development process and can be used in
					all
					types of businesses.<br />This roadmap is a guide that demonstrates where to go, how to get there,
					and
					what to accomplish along the way in order to maximize value.<br />It helps map out a product idea
					and
					the strategy for how to deliver it.<br />As the team follows their roadmap, they gather input from
					customers and stakeholders and apply their findings to each iteration of the product.<br />Creating
					a
					roadmap helps the team explain the vision of the product and can also be used to identify important
					milestones.<br />A typical value roadmap has three components– a product vision, a product roadmap,
					and
					release plans.<br />The first component of a value roadmap is the product vision.<br />Your product
					vision is a critical step to starting any new Scrum project.<br />Your vision is based on your user
					interviews and market analysis and becomes your team’s North Star.<br />In other words, it’s what
					guides
					your team.<br />The product vision defines what the product is, how it supports the customer’s
					business
					strategy, and who will use it.<br />Next, there’s the product roadmap, which the product owner is
					responsible for creating and maintaining.<br />It provides a high level view of the expected
					product,
					its requirements, and an estimated schedule for reaching milestones.<br />Its key to making sure
					your
					team is building the right thing.<br />The third component of a value roadmap is a series of release
					plans.<br />The product owner and project manager work together to develop these plans.<br />Product
					releases occur when the team has developed a basic working version of a given feature or
					requirement.<br />A release plan includes the approximate date when the team is expected to release
					and
					deliver certain features to the customer or user.<br />An agile team may have several releases over
					the
					course of a project until their project is considered done.<br />For this reason, only the first
					release
					date should be considered to be set in stone.<br />The rest of the release plan is based on early
					estimates, and is subject to change as the project proceeds.<br />A release plan contains a release
					goal, which is an overall business goal for the features you plan to include in the release; the
					list of
					backlog items, such as epics, user stories, or features that you require for that release goal; an
					estimated release date; and any other relevant dates that impact a release, like a convention or
					major
					holiday.<br />It’s important to add all of your release plans to your value roadmap to help you stay
					focused on the path to your overall value goal.<br />In summary, the value roadmap contains three
					key
					components– the product vision, product roadmap, and release plan.<br />These three work together to
					help an agile team reach its goals through multiple iterations.<br />A value roadmap only works if
					the
					team is collaborative and all stakeholders work together regularly.<br />This will ensure that the
					project achieves results that align with the agile values and principles.<br />[MUSIC PLAYING] My
					first
					tip is about creating the product roadmap.<br />The product roadmap provides a high level view of
					the
					expected product, its requirements, and an estimated timeline for reaching milestones.<br />Many of
					those milestones will be product release dates.<br />You’ll need to ensure that product release
					dates
					are only rough estimates.<br />This is because, as an agile team, you know that things can and do
					change.<br />This is especially true since these dates could be anywhere from several months to
					several
					years down the road.<br />If the roadmap is too specific, it might set the team up for failure
					because
					the dates can’t be guaranteed.<br />Speaking of product release dates, this leads me to my next tip,
					which is about the release plans.<br />There are some important things to know about creating a
					release
					plan, which includes approximate target release dates.<br />It’s very important that the product
					owner
					and project manager or Scrum master work together to develop each release plan.<br />This is because
					the
					release plans need to connect the product roadmap with the team’s capacity and velocity.<br />The
					capacity and velocity is the measure of the team’s ability to complete work at a certain
					pace.<br />A
					release plan that isn’t connected to the team’s ability to complete work could be unrealistic and
					lead
					to an unsustainable pace for the team.<br />This would violate one of our agile principles, which
					states
					agile processes promote sustainable development.<br />The sponsors, developers, and users should be
					able
					to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.<br />If there are any hard dates or deadlines on your
					roadmap,
					meaning a date that cannot change, factor these into any release plans that might be
					affected.<br />For
					example, Virtual Verde might realize that Office Green has an office decor convention in October,
					and
					they want to launch the first phase of Virtual Verde services at that event.<br />Communicate hard
					deadlines with your stakeholders so there’s a clear understanding of must-have features.<br />This
					way,
					if the team discovers it might be at risk for not meeting the deadlines, they can quickly focus on
					the
					must-have features.<br />Since agile is all about embracing and anticipating change it might seem
					like
					having a release plan goes against the agile value of responding to change over following a
					plan.<br />But having a release plan does not mean you are a resistant to change.<br />An agile team
					treats a release plan as a living artifact, so the plan can change based on the environment and new
					information that’s received.<br />Some common factors that may result in a change to the release
					plan
					could include a change in team velocity or how much work the team can do in a given iteration or
					sprint.<br />This could be from adding or losing team members, or even just efficiency gains from
					how
					they work.<br />A second factor is a change to the product scope if the product owner approves the
					change to the product.<br />And a third factor that could affect a release plan is improving the
					understanding of how much effort is needed to build certain features.<br />The team may discover
					that a
					user story or epic is more or less difficult than they originally thought after doing some research
					or
					simply from better understanding the product space.<br />My last tip for creating an effective value
					roadmap is that the Scrum master or project manager should always review the release plan before
					starting a sprint planning session.<br />They review the release plan to check whether the team is
					on
					track.<br />If the team is off track, the Scrum master needs to have an open conversation with the
					product owner and business people to figure out what they can adjust to get back on track.<br />This
					is
					where the Scrum value of transparency is key.<br />An effective value roadmap is a powerful tool for
					building and delivering successful products.<br />The plans you create will help you stay focused on
					delivering maximum value and the ability to remain flexible and stay agile.<br />[MUSIC PLAYING] As
					you
					conduct your project management job search, you’re likely to find many of the organizations you
					apply to
					as either already being agile, making the switch to becoming agile, or not yet agile, but ready to
					transition.<br />As an entry level product manager, it’s not likely you’ll be expected to lead a
					complete change to agile in a large organization, but you may be expected to help support the change
					process.<br />On the other hand, you might get hired by a smaller organization that does want you to
					lead the change.<br />The techniques I’ll share with you in this video will set you up to be
					prepared
					for all of these different scenarios.<br />Let’s begin.<br />First, let’s review some of the key
					learnings from one of the earlier courses on organizational culture and change management.<br />When
					an
					organization shifts the way it conducts business, it usually requires a shift in its culture as
					well.<br />Understanding organizational culture and the change management process is crucial when
					introducing new ways of working.<br />Organizational culture is based on shared workplace values and
					pops up in people’s behaviors, activities, the way they communicate, and how they work with each
					other.<br />A change that’s out of sync with the existing culture is much more difficult to
					complete.<br />In fact, there’s research proving that companies that don’t consider the cultural
					aspects
					of agile are more likely to fail.<br />Change management is the process of getting folks to adopt a
					new
					product, process, or in agile’s case, a new value system.<br />Let’s get into how to help introduce
					or
					continue the adoption of agile or Scrum into an organization.<br />Unless the organization has many
					years of agile behaviors and experience, you may be facing a change in organizational
					culture.<br />These changes take time, sometimes years to complete.<br />As a project manager, you
					might
					only implement a few changes, and that’s OK.<br />You’ll still be adding value by demonstrating to
					your
					team or organization new and different ways of approaching their business.<br />I’ll share with you
					some
					words of wisdom I heard from a colleague many years ago.<br />They said, change takes patient
					persistence.<br />It may feel like things are taking too long, but in many cases, small changes add
					up
					to a big change in the long run.<br />So what are some ways that you can bring agile or Scrum to a
					new
					team?<br />First, I want you to think about the concept of creating a sense of ownership and
					urgency.<br />When people feel a sense of ownership and urgency around a project, it increases
					interest,
					motivation, and engagement with the project outcome.<br />One way to create a sense of ownership is
					to
					find an executive sponsor who also feels a sense of ownership for the change you’re
					creating.<br />Wherever possible, point out connections between the changes you’re making and the
					company’s stated mission or values.<br />Having buy-in from someone at the top increases your
					chances of
					successfully driving any change in organizational culture.<br />Ideally, your sponsor will reinforce
					the
					benefits of agile to the organization and give you the support and resources you need.<br />What
					about
					creating a sense of urgency?<br />My favorite approach to this is to ask the team, the organization,
					and
					the stakeholders questions about what’s working and what’s not working right now.<br />Then I ensure
					the
					changes relate directly to those opportunities.<br />Here are some questions you could
					try.<br />What is
					preventing us from providing the best possible product to our customers?<br />What is allowing our
					competitors to outperform us in this market?<br />And how can we help our teams become more
					productive
					and supported in their work?<br />This not only helps you prioritize your work, you get the team
					thinking about the possibilities they’ll enjoy if the change is successful.<br />You can use these
					questions going forward to collect feedback during the change.<br />Coming back to these questions
					and
					demonstrating the incremental improvements is the true spirit of agile.<br />Let’s come back to our
					friends at Virtual Verde.<br />When the team set out to create this agile project and change towards
					an
					agile approach, they realized that the CEO of Office Green wanted to make sure they took advantage
					of
					the market trends since more people were moving to home offices.<br />They created a sense of
					urgency by
					highlighting that home office decorating was becoming a hot online trend, and they wanted Office
					Green
					to become a part of the action.<br />Lastly, the Virtual Verde team had lots of experience from
					their
					Plant Pals project, so they could gather a team who was motivated to apply what they learned and try
					a
					different approach to a new market opportunity.<br />Bringing agile or Scrum to a new team could be
					challenging, but well worth the effort.<br />By applying some of these techniques, you’ll increase
					your
					chances of success.<br />I’ve found that, with a little patient persistence, you can get past some
					of
					the initial skepticism, and the benefits of an agile approach will start to become obvious to the
					team.<br />Once this happens, change will become easier to drive over time with their
					commitments.<br />I once had a large global team at Google of about 200 developers.<br />My director
					and
					I wanted to transform them into an agile organization.<br />It took us about two years and many
					trips to
					different work sites for me and my team of project managers to deliver the tools, processes, and
					coaching to bring the team up to speed on an agile way of working.<br />I approached that
					transformation
					very much like how I described here, and it worked.<br />[MUSIC PLAYING] As the project manager or
					Scrum
					master, you’re in the position to help the team improve.<br />In other words, you’re the designated
					agile coach.<br />You’re there to help the team recognize areas for improvement and help them
					implement
					solutions.<br />In this video, I’m going to break down your role as a coach into three steps,
					similar to
					how you might approach being a coach for a sports team.<br />First, you’ll design the plays with the
					team.<br />Second, you’ll provide feedback to the team.<br />And lastly you’ll celebrate and learn
					with
					the team.<br />Let me elaborate on each area bit more.<br />First, the Scrum master designs the
					plays.<br />Although the Scrum master owns the playbook, it should be created with the whole
					team.<br />The playbook should include how the whole team runs a sprint review, how the team works
					day
					to day, and how the team publishes plans to stakeholders.<br />When updates are needed to the team’s
					plays, it’s important that you involve the team in any decisions.<br />Take them through new
					processes
					together.<br />Think through all the positions on the team and make sure everyone notices the
					flow.<br />A personal example of this was when I facilitated a brainstorm meeting with my team to
					discuss which parts of our process weren’t working.<br />We used sticky notes to organize our ideas
					for
					improvement and then prioritized the ideas to implement changes.<br />Second is provide
					feedback.<br />You should always provide feedback to your team and stakeholders as early as possible
					and
					on a day to day basis.<br />Just like a coach gives directions from the sidelines, the Scrum master
					needs to provide guidance all the time.<br />In addition to feedback provided in the moment, the
					Scrum
					master also takes in a big picture view.<br />This is similar to how a coach might watch a video
					recap
					of the game to find patterns that need improvement or plays that worked so well they should do it
					every
					game.<br />Providing feedback shouldn’t only be about fixing broken things, but finding processes
					and
					activities that work really well and encourage the team to continue using the things that
					work.<br />Third, celebrate and learn.<br />Congratulate the team often on a job well done, a happy
					customer, or a big solution launch.<br />If the team, quote, unquote, loses, meaning they weren’t
					successful in fulfilling a requirement, acknowledge that loss as critical data that will help the
					team
					improve next time.<br />It’s important for the team to still feel positive about any disappointment
					and
					think of it as a learning opportunity.<br />As Thomas Edison famously said, I have not
					failed.<br />I’ve
					just found 10,000 ways that won’t work.<br />As a Scrum master or agile project manager, you play an
					essential role in the team, and you’re a big part of why Scrum and agile work at all.<br />You’re
					responsible for ensuring the team is always improving and becoming the best team it can possibly
					be.<br />Awesome.<br />Now, you know the three steps of coaching your team– designing the plays with
					the
					team, providing feedback to the team, and celebrating and learning with the team.<br />Next up,
					we’ll
					learn how to anticipate and respond to real world risks with agile and Scrum
					implementations.<br />Meet
					you there.<br />[MUSIC PLAYING] As the project manager or Scrum master, it’s your responsibility to
					help
					teams improve how they work and coach them on how to effectively adopt Scrum practices.<br />So
					anticipating and understanding how to work through common challenges before they happen is super
					important.<br />Remember the four themes of agile principles that we discussed in an earlier
					video?<br />To refresh your memory, the themes are value delivery, business collaboration, team
					dynamics
					and culture, and retrospectives.<br />In this video, we’ll focus on challenges you might encounter
					with
					an agile team that are related to the first three themes.<br />The first set of challenges are
					related
					to value delivery, which is about making sure the team is delivering working solutions
					frequently.<br />Some signs that your team is experiencing value delivery issues could include
					things
					like the team has started missing expected delivery dates and is taking a lot longer than usual to
					complete tasks.<br />Or you might notice that the team seemed burned out, is working long hours, and
					showing signs of exhaustion.<br />Or maybe the team has too many items in progress at any given
					time,
					preventing tasks from actually getting to done.<br />If you start to notice your team is struggling
					in
					these areas, there are a few things you can do to help.<br />You can try doing more demos of the
					solutions with the team to ensure they’re delivering on the value roadmap.<br />When the team pauses
					to
					take in a big picture view of the working product, they often notice areas where they can improve
					and
					speed up the work.<br />You can also use retrospectives to ask the team if anything is slowing them
					down, like waiting on dependencies or communication challenges.<br />It can also help to do a quick
					review with the team and make sure that everyone understands what done means.<br />And finally, be
					sure
					to focus on only a few user stories per sprint.<br />This ensures the team finishes an item together
					before moving on.<br />Putting all this into practice can be harder than you might think.<br />My
					current team is asked to cover a lot of ground in each sprint, so it can be tempting for us to try
					and
					tackle too much at once.<br />But doing that usually just makes everything take longer, so it’s not
					actually helpful.<br />It’s better to maintain focus and deliver fewer backlog items in one sprint
					than
					to deliver a lot of items in more sprints.<br />Another set of challenges you might encounter relate
					to
					the business collaboration theme.<br />To recap, business collaboration is about making sure the
					developers are collaborating with business people on how to build the right product.<br />There are
					a
					few common signs that your team might be experiencing business collaboration issues.<br />You might
					notice that the team is overwhelmed with critical feedback or change requests from business people
					after
					they reviewed the working solution.<br />That could lead to people on your team avoiding asking for
					feedback or complaining about requested changes coming from the product owner or business
					team.<br />Or
					you might start to detect an us versus them mentality between the team doing the work and
					management.<br />I’ve sometimes noticed this manifest in negative comments from team members, like
					oh,
					don’t give a demo to the salesperson.<br />It’s not ready yet, and they’ll just point out what’s
					wrong.<br />If you notice any of these signs there are a few things you can do to help rebuild trust
					and
					collaboration between the developers and the business people.<br />To start with, try addressing
					critical feedback and change requests by doing more demos.<br />This ensures feedback comes in at a
					steady pace, and that everyone involved has a shared understanding of what done means.<br />Next,
					consider conducting a solution design sprint, which is an entire sprint spent working solely on the
					solution design.<br />These are most effective when the working team and the business people
					actually
					sit together and collaborate on the solution.<br />Finally, you can help your team focus by ensuring
					changes to the backlog are introduced only in between sprints.<br />This prevents your team from
					getting
					distracted by possible changes, which could stress them out and lead to resentment.<br />For
					example, I
					was once on a Scrum team where the engineering director loved to stop by the engineer’s desk to ask
					for
					a quick dashboard, which is a web page that shows data.<br />Asking the engineer to do this
					completely
					disrupted the team’s focus and slowed down the team’s velocity.<br />We finally decided to ask the
					director to come straight to the Scrum master when they needed something so that it could be planned
					properly, and not interrupt the team’s current workflow.<br />Let’s move on to the third theme, team
					dynamics and culture.<br />Human beings are complex creatures with lots of different motivations and
					styles of working, so it’s likely that you’ll encounter at least a few challenges in this
					area.<br />Here are a few common signs of team dynamics and culture issues to watch out
					for.<br />First
					is low team morale.<br />If people are super grumpy, irritated, or generally in a bad mood, then you
					might have some underlying team dynamics issues to sort out.<br />Next, watch out for signs the team
					is
					experiencing lots of conflict.<br />If people are arguing a lot, and issues aren’t getting resolved,
					the
					team probably needs some help.<br />Not everyone is going to get their way.<br />If team members
					feel
					resentful or are holding onto grudges, it’ll negatively impact the team’s performance.<br />And
					finally,
					and this might surprise you, but low conflict can also be a sign that the team’s experiencing
					issues.<br />We’re usually taught to believe that no conflict is a good thing, but if a team never
					has
					disagreements, it’s a sign that they might be worried about starting a conflict because they don’t
					feel
					like it’s a safe environment.<br />Being open and courageous are two of our Scrum values, but it’s
					not
					always easy to put them into practice.<br />As a project manager, part of your role is helping your
					team
					get comfortable being honest with each other and working through conflicts together.<br />If you
					notice
					these, or any other clear signs of team distress, here are some ideas you can try.<br />You could
					run a
					team brainstorm session about how to work better together.<br />Ask the team to identify some areas
					to
					improve on.<br />An example exercise could involve asking the team to write down stories about the
					worst
					team they’ve ever worked on and the best team they’ve ever worked on, then sharing them in a
					meeting.<br />Then you might have the team create a list of do’s and don’ts for working together
					based
					on the stories everyone shared.<br />Another idea is to change up the workflows.<br />Try pairing up
					people to work together on a hard task or change up the way you run one of your regular
					meetings.<br />It can also help to take a training class together or watch a video about team
					dynamics
					and discuss it as a group.<br />You can also try a retrospective technique from the
					internet.<br />There
					are a ton of great resources out there.<br />One of my favorite retrospective techniques is called
					the
					Six Hats Thinking technique.<br />In this technique, each team member chooses a different hat to
					explore
					the subject of the retrospective.<br />The different hats each involve a different objective, like
					discussing positives or negatives that happen during the sprint or sharing emotive
					statements.<br />This
					helps ensure that the team takes a well rounded approach to the retrospective.<br />[MUSIC PLAYING]
					The
					three challenges we’ll focus on are managing a stable product roadmap, incomplete implementation of
					Scrum, and experiencing a lack of stability within the team.<br />First, let’s discuss the challenge
					of
					managing a stable product roadmap.<br />Agile projects almost always experience changes in the
					product
					roadmap.<br />Being able to respond quickly and productively to these changes is a core agile value,
					but
					it is possible to have too much change impacting the project, which can lead to an unstable product
					roadmap.<br />There are two main causes of an unstable product roadmap, product ambition and product
					assumptions.<br />Let’s cover product ambition first.<br />Product ambition poses a challenge when
					product leadership is overly ambitious about what the team can realistically deliver.<br />The
					product
					owner is responsible for representing the product to customers and executives.<br />Because the
					product
					owner wants to make the stakeholders happy, it can be easy for them to overpromise what the project
					can
					deliver.<br />For example, imagine that our Office Green CEO notices that the Virtual Verde business
					in
					North America is doing really well.<br />In a meeting they say to the product owner, this is
					amazing.<br />I’d love to launch Virtual Verde in Asia in the next four months.<br />What do you
					think?<br />The product owner really wants to deliver, so they tell the CEO, sure, but the product
					owner
					won’t actually know if meeting this objective is possible until they discuss it with the team, which
					means they might accidentally be setting an unrealistic expectation with the CEO.<br />So how do you
					deal with this challenge?<br />Here are three ideas to maintain a healthy roadmap management plan
					between you and the product owner.<br />First, agree up front how to handle new
					opportunities.<br />Define when they are reviewed and estimated, and how customer or management
					commitments are made.<br />Second, set up regular roadmap reviews with the entire team at least
					quarterly, so that everyone knows what to expect.<br />And third, promote sharing knowledge between
					the
					product owner and the development team so that the product owner knows how much effort the product
					takes
					to build, and the team is aware of changes as early as possible.<br />The second thing that can
					cause an
					unstable product roadmap is making too many product assumptions.<br />When there’s uncertainty in a
					project, you may be required to make some assumptions to move things forward, but making too many
					assumptions can jeopardize the team’s success.<br />Let’s go back to our Virtual Verde
					example.<br />Sending plants to customers’ homes is a complex process.<br />You need to consider a
					lot
					of different factors, like which plants will sell best, which plants will stay healthy in a wide
					variety
					of climates and settings, and what vendors to work with?<br />The team does their best to study the
					market and opportunity, but they have to make some assumptions and move forward with decisions,
					relying
					on less than perfect information.<br />As a way to deal with product assumption issues, document the
					assumptions and make them transparent.<br />This allows you to discuss the assumptions as a team and
					either agree that they’re safe assumptions to make or decide to question and double check
					them.<br />If
					you do decide to double check them you can use unbiased user research.<br />Unbiased user research
					gathers information about what users really want.<br />It allows you to confirm or reject
					assumptions
					and helps you move forward with confidence.<br />User research could involve conducting surveys,
					running
					focus groups, or using other methods to collect objective data about your users.<br />The next big
					challenge you might encounter relates to an incomplete implementation of Scrum.<br />This happens
					when
					Scrum practices are only partially implemented or when Scrum practices are implemented without
					proper
					support and coaching.<br />Scrum roles, artifacts, and activities are designed to work together as a
					set.<br />If you only partially implement them, you might end up reducing their
					benefits.<br />Incomplete implementation of Scrum can cause a lot of issues.<br />First, it can lead
					to
					a loss of clear roles and responsibilities.<br />To implement Scrum completely, you should define
					the
					roles for the team and then fill those roles with specific individuals.<br />For example, if you try
					to
					have a developer also act as the Scrum master, they might not have the bandwidth to do either role
					very
					well.<br />Better to have developers be on the development team and you, the project manager, be the
					Scrum master.<br />You might also be tempted to skip some events or blend them to save
					time.<br />But a
					lack of clear boundaries for sprint review, sprint retrospective, and sprint planning can lead to
					reduced transparency, inspection, and adaptation, and these are all essential to experience the full
					benefits of Scrum.<br />And finally, not providing the team with the Scrum coaching they need would
					also
					mean that you haven’t fulfilled your role as Scrum master.<br />It’s your job to fully explain the
					Scrum
					practices and provide coaching, so your team understands the reasoning behind the practices and can
					embrace their benefits.<br />The solution to all of these challenges is to implement Scrum
					completely.<br />Being the ScrumMaster is a critical role.<br />You’re the coach, so you should
					reinforce the connections between the team’s activities and the Scrum and agile values.<br />For
					example, if your team complains about daily standups, remind them that the purpose of standups is to
					gain feedback, unblock work, ask for help, and reinforce the importance of staying focused on the
					sprint
					goals.<br />You can also make sure roles are well defined and properly fulfilled.<br />For example,
					ensure that all team members understand their own roles, as well as the roles of their teammates and
					how
					those roles interact.<br />For example, the product owner makes sure we build the right thing, the
					development team ensures we build it right, and the Scrum master ensures we build it fast.<br />And
					finally, the last big challenge you might encounter with agile and Scrum teams is a lack of team
					stability.<br />When the team changes a lot, with people leaving and joining frequently, it can make
					things unpredictable and disrupt the flow of work.<br />There are a few things you can do to address
					instability on your team.<br />First, have a quick onboarding process for new team members to help
					them
					get to know the rest of the team and understand the project.<br />Second, use a “pair programming”
					style, where a new team member teams up with a colleague and starts learning on the job.<br />This
					also
					helps if people leave the team, since a partner should be able to pick up where they left
					off.<br />And
					third, if team composition changes because members keep leaving, try having shorter
					sprints.<br />This
					way, team members can wrap up their last sprints worth of work before leaving.<br />To recap, the
					three
					main challenges we’ve covered in this video are managing a stable product roadmap, incomplete
					implementation of Scrum, and a lack of team stability.<br />I’ve encountered each of these
					challenges
					and more in many of my teams.<br />The wonderful thing about agile is that there’s a huge community
					of
					agilists that are happy to help with any challenges you might come across.<br />Even an experienced
					agilist like myself asks for help now and then.<br />Coming up, we’ll explore how agile is evolving
					and
					keeping up with the times.<br />Now, that’s an agile way to be.<br />[MUSIC PLAYING] Since its
					creation
					in 2001, agile popularity has increased incredibly fast.<br />One industry report showed that 85% of
					organizations have adopted a product centric model, which is associated with an agile
					approach.<br />The
					“State of Agile” report describes how 30% of those companies using the product centric model apply a
					hybrid of methodologies.<br />This means that being able to blend methods will be a super useful
					skill
					to have as you start your project management career.<br />Like we explained in an earlier video, one
					of
					the reasons for agile is growing popularity is that we’re in a very VUCA world.<br />Businesses face
					a
					lot of Volatility, Uncertainty, Complexity, and Ambiguity, and they recognize that agile and the
					frameworks that derive from it are a way to overcome those challenges.<br />In this video, we’ll
					discuss
					how agile has already started evolving and explore some emerging ideas about how it might continue
					to
					evolve in the future.<br />The Agile Manifesto, as a mindset or philosophy, hasn’t changed much in
					almost 30 years.<br />The frameworks it inspired, though, have continued changing and evolving to
					keep
					up with changing business environments.<br />One emerging agile framework is called DevOps, which
					combines software development and IT operations.<br />Our Google Cloud platform business defines
					DevOps
					as an organizational and cultural movement that aims to increase software delivery velocity, improve
					service reliability, and build shared ownership among software stakeholders.<br />Like all agile
					frameworks, DevOps aims to shorten the product lifecycle and deliver software products continuously
					and
					with very high quality.<br />DevOps emerged when software companies were faced with trying to figure
					out
					how to ensure their software products would run reliably for billions of people across the world, 24
					hours a day, seven days a week.<br />As someone who spent my first few years at Google studying
					product
					breakdowns, I can tell you how difficult this is.<br />If a business has the ability to launch
					products
					and features fast and reliably to a global marketplace, that’s a significant competitive
					advantage.<br />DevOps is about growing and managing teams and organizations that can build and
					evolve
					large-scale systems at a rapid pace.<br />These systems need to be both secure and reliable so they
					can
					better deliver value to customers and organizations.<br />If you decide to pursue a project manager
					role
					in the DevOps framework, you’ll venture into the future of Agile approaches and large-scale software
					systems that are literally changing the world.<br />Pretty exciting, right?<br />One of the next
					frontiers of Agile is called business agility, which involves incorporating Agile principles into
					the
					wide sphere of management so that the organization can thrive in high VUCA
					environments.<br />Organizations that want to become Agile in this sense often find themselves
					rethinking everything, from financial planning processes, governance, and reporting structures to
					hiring
					and HR practices, and much more.<br />They’re looking for ways to make Agile values and frameworks
					work
					for larger and larger organizations.<br />As an Agile project manager in a larger organization, you
					might find yourself using frameworks like Scrum of Scrums or Scaled Agile Framework, also known as
					SAFe.<br />Check out the resources and readings for this video to learn more.<br />It’s also
					important
					to call out that Agile has reached a lot of industries beyond technology and
					software.<br />Recently, I
					was asked to give Agile training to the Google sales team in Latin America.<br />They experienced
					major
					changes in their market and wanted to develop the skills to react quickly to those changes and still
					deliver results.<br />During the training, we had great discussions about the benefits of
					Agile.<br />The team especially liked how Agile can help reduce risk at all stages of their sales
					cycle
					through early feedback and frequent and thorough discussions with teammates and customers.<br />Even
					the
					construction industry has started applying an Agile approach to their projects.<br />An article
					published by the Project Management Institute describes how construction projects used Agile to deal
					with delays and budget overruns by translating the Agile Manifesto into construction industry terms,
					like silos are minimized and close cooperation is encouraged.<br />And finally, Agile methodologies
					can
					also be applied to your own personal life.<br />For example, I was planning a move recently and
					immediately set up a Kanban board to start planning my tasks.<br />Have any projects in your life
					that
					could use a Kanban board?<br />How about a garage cleanup or a family reunion or
					barbecue?<br />Who’s on
					your Scrum team?<br />From DevOps and business agility to Agile methodologies in the construction
					industry and beyond, it’s clear that Agile’s benefits will be useful for a long time to
					come.<br />The
					practitioners, project managers, and teams who live and breathe the Agile values are the ones that
					help
					Agile evolve and advance, which means that you can play an important role in contributing to the
					future
					of Agile, too.<br />Coming up, we’ll explore how to approach your job search so you can find an
					opportunity in Agile project management.<br />Meet you there.<br />[MUSIC PLAYING] We just covered
					the
					evolution of Agile, and I shared how other organizations are adopting Agile practices.<br />We also
					discussed the best mindset for delivering value to users as quickly as possible.<br />Agile project
					management opportunities are everywhere.<br />Whether you’re looking for a new role in Agile or want
					to
					incorporate Agile into your current lifestyle or workplace, I have a few tips to help get you
					there.<br />Let’s start by discussing how to land an Agile project management position.<br />These
					types
					of jobs might show up on job boards as Agile project manager, Scrum master, IT Agile project
					manager, or
					a DevOps project manager.<br />After taking this course, you’ll be a great fit for any one of
					these.<br />Look for a role that suits your experience level, complements your industry domain
					expertise, and offers growth opportunities.<br />Also look for a role that provides a culture that
					would
					be a good fit for you.<br />And I can’t emphasize enough how important it is to find an employer who
					supports your goals and personal growth.<br />I’m a hiring manager at Google.<br />I’ve interviewed
					and
					hired many project managers here, both Agile and non-Agile, and I’d like to share how I approach
					interviewing and searching for an excellent Agile project manager for my team.<br />Even if a
					candidate
					doesn’t have Agile on their resume, one of the first things I ask them is, what’s the difference
					between
					Agile and Waterfall project management?<br />Their answer usually tells me instantly if they know
					what
					Agile is about, and it’s a great launching off point for more follow-up questions.<br />In the
					candidate’s answer to that question, I look for a few specific things.<br />I want to know whether
					the
					candidate knows that Agile is more than just Scrum, Sprints, and Standups.<br />Do they know it’s
					also
					about founding values that include customer collaboration, value delivery, self-organizing
					teams?<br />I’m also interested to know whether they make Waterfall out to be the worst solution, or
					do
					they know that all projects benefit from certain types of approaches, including Waterfall, like
					clear
					requirements, risk management, stakeholder awareness, and more?<br />I also ask, how do you know
					when to
					use an Agile approach or frameworks on your project?<br />Their answer helps me know if they
					understand
					how Agile or Scrum can help a project manager with specific challenges, and what those challenges
					are.<br />And finally, I ask, if you are facing resistance with your team following a Scrum or Agile
					practice, how do you convince them to give it a try?<br />Their answer helps me understand how they
					use
					communication and influence skills, and whether they truly believe that an Agile team can be
					self-organizing.<br />At Google, our teams sometimes resist being told what to do, especially
					because
					this can diminish innovation and creativity.<br />So I always want to hire project managers who work
					with the team and don’t try to force them to do things a particular way.<br />An important part of
					every
					interview is when the candidate gets to ask the interviewers questions.<br />These could be
					questions
					about the job, about the interviewer’s experience in project management, about the culture, and
					about
					the job expectations.<br />This is a huge opportunity for you as the candidate.<br />As an Agile
					project
					manager, you now know how crucial culture is to the success of an Agile project.<br />This is a
					great
					time to ask questions that will help you determine if you’ll be happy with this job or
					not.<br />Some
					questions you should ask are, how supportive is the management here towards blending project
					management
					approaches?<br />What’s the first thing I should know about the culture here?<br />And how often
					will I
					get to hear about the needs of our users or customers?<br />And what would a typical day look like
					for
					me if I were to take on this position?<br />Maybe you’re not interviewing for a new role, but you
					want
					to bring what you learned in this Agile course back to your team.<br />How would you go about
					that?<br />As we discussed, bringing Agile or Scrum to a new team is often challenging if their
					culture
					doesn’t support it.<br />Here are four things that helped me bring Agile to my teams.<br />First,
					start
					small.<br />You may be excited by everything you’ve learned here, but your team might like things
					how
					they are.<br />So introduce Agile practices in bite-sized pieces.<br />Maybe start by using a Kanban
					board, just to keep track of one work stream, or set up a retrospective after a major
					milestone.<br />Second, listen to feedback.<br />The most powerful tool a project manager has is the
					ability to listen to their team and meet them where they are.<br />When you introduce changes, ask
					the
					team how it’s going.<br />Get their ideas on how to make it better, and include them in your
					approach.<br />This will amplify your small changes into big results for the team.<br />Third, be
					strategic.<br />Target your improvements to challenges your team has today.<br />Introduce new ways
					of
					working that address head-on the biggest issues your team’s experiencing.<br />For example, maybe
					your
					team has trouble estimating effort predictably, and always ends up in crunch mode.<br />Maybe
					relative
					estimation techniques would help with that.<br />Or maybe you have too many people chiming in on
					what
					the product should be– introducing a single person who acts as the product owner to help ensure
					consistency in prioritizing features.<br />Lastly, find allies.<br />You may have setbacks or need
					to
					lean on supporters to bring these ideas back to your team.<br />Find Agile allies in your
					organization
					or network.<br />These allies will give you advice when things get rough and help you stick to Agile
					values and principles.<br />We built up a network of about 60 volunteer Agile coaches here at
					Google,
					and we’re always leaning on each other for ideas and solutions.<br />SPEAKER 2: Congratulations on
