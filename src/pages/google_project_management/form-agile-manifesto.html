				<p id="1cf468a0-53d4-81b4-ad01-ed97f7db9e57" class="">SPEAKER: The Agile Manifesto was written in 2001,
					and
					brings together the collective wisdom of the people who developed it from their vast experience and
					thought leadership in the tech industry.<br />If you’d like to find the Manifesto, it’s
					easy.<br />Just
					type in agilemanifesto.org in your search browser.<br />We’ve made it available for you here in the
					course readings, as well.<br />Let’s check it out.<br />The Manifesto for Agile Software Development
					states, “We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do
					it.<br />Through this work, we have come to value individuals and interactions over processes and
					tools,
					working software over comprehensive documentation, customer collaboration over contract negotiation,
					responding to change over following a plan.<br />That is, while there is value in the items on the
					right, we value the items on the left more.” There you have it.<br />The Agile Manifesto and the
					four
					values of Agile.<br />It’s a short list, but it packs a punch.<br />The Manifesto is saying that
					it’s
					helpful for every Agile team to think about both sides of each statement during the execution of a
					project, but should find ways to ensure that they’re always placing more value and emphasis on the
					things on the left over the things on the right.<br />From the four values, a set of 12 principles
					were
					developed that reinforce the message of the Manifesto.<br />These values and principles inform the
					why,
					how, and what of Agile project management planning and processes.<br />Let’s take it from the
					top.<br />First, the Manifesto emphasizes individuals and interactions over processes and
					tools.<br />At
					its core, this value stresses people communicating with each other over using lots of processes and
					tools to force things to happen in a certain way.<br />For example, have you ever emailed someone
					with a
					question and ended up in a long back and forth exchange due to simple follow-up questions or
					clarifications?<br />Chances are that you could have gotten the same information in less time with a
					brief conversation.<br />Agile wants to ensure that teams work together, collaborate, and help each
					other achieve the best outcomes they can.<br />Agile also values individual perspectives and
					creativity.<br />This does not mean that every team is chaotic.<br />The value just means that
					processes
					and tools should be used to facilitate and drive good project management and improved collaboration
					within the team, and should never be used as a barrier to teams working well with each
					other.<br />The
					second value emphasizes working software over comprehensive documentation, meaning that teams should
					prioritize spending time working on things that actually create value, and avoid spending any more
					time
					than they really need on debating, writing, and reviewing documents.<br />Now, this value might seem
					like it only applies to software projects.<br />But just replace the term “working software” with
					whatever your project is trying to deliver.<br />Maybe the project is writing a legal brief,
					designing
					an office layout, or preparing a sales presentation.<br />Whatever your project is trying to deliver
					is
					the thing that creates value.<br />In other words, it’s more important to deliver the product the
					customer wants than to comprehensively document the process that you used.<br />On to the third
					value,
					customer collaboration over contract negotiation.<br />In Agile projects, the customer satisfaction
					is
					considered the highest priority of building a high quality and valuable product.<br />After all, if
					it’s
					not valuable to the customer, then there’s little point spending time on it.<br />When the Manifesto
					discusses contracts, it refers to the official documents that require sign off and formal agreement
					with
					the customer, such as those huge requirement documents or formal change requests.<br />Agile values
					having the freedom to collaborate with customers early and often.<br />In doing so, teams can
					quickly
					react and adapt to what customers need, rather than waiting out the process of negotiating contract
					terms just to make a few changes or request resources.<br />There will still be contracts with Agile
					project management, but the focus is on identifying what’s really needed and leaving space for
					collaborative, customer-focused work.<br />Agile teams are encouraged to seek out every opportunity
					to
					include the customer or stakeholder during project execution.<br />This could be presenting early
					prototypes, asking questions, or bringing them in to do some initial product testing.<br />And
					finally,
					we have the fourth value, responding to change over following a plan.<br />This last value is
					crucial to
					an Agile project.<br />As I explained in the history overview, Agile grew out of a world that was
					changing so fast that organizations couldn’t adapt and struggled to survive.<br />As a result, this
					value stresses that every Agile team needs to acknowledge that change is inevitable.<br />The
					larger,
					longer, and more complex your project is, the more uncertainty there is.<br />For many projects,
					finalizing a well-established plan at the beginning of the project will likely lead to an on-time
					delivery within budget, but may run the risk of not meeting customer needs or adding maximum
					value.<br />As a project manager, the key takeaway to remember here is that the most successful
					projects
					are the ones that are able to smoothly integrate change.<br />Agile project managers still create
					and
					value their plans, but they can cope with, and are able to adapt, if the plans need revising at any
					time
					during the project.<br />So there you have it, the four Agile values.<br />Individuals and
					interactions
					over processes and tools, working software over comprehensive documentation, customer collaboration
					over
					contract negotiation, and responding to change over following a plan.<br />What’s great about Agile
					is
					that it gives us these values, and also lets us find the right balance between the two
					sides.<br />You
					may have to fine-tune your project style to meet industry needs, team dynamics, and organizational
					goals
					to find the healthy balance that works for you and your team.<br />I’ve grouped the 12 principles
					into
					four themes.<br />These are different from the four values.<br />The four themes of the Agile
					principles
					are value delivery, or how do Agile teams deliver highly valuable products to their
					customers?<br />Business collaboration, or how do Agile teams collaborate with their business
					partners
					and stakeholders to create business value to the organization and their users?<br />Team culture, or
					how
					does a team create and maintain the right interpersonal and team dynamics to deliver value for the
					customers and the business?<br />And retrospectives, or how does the project learn to continuously
					increase performance of an organization and business?<br />As I said, I’ve grouped each of the 12
					principles under these themes so they’re easier to learn and remember.<br />Let’s dive in.<br />The
					first theme is value delivery, and includes five principles.<br />Take a few seconds to review
					them.<br />This theme is about delivering the work as quickly as possible.<br />And remember
					why?<br />So that we can get feedback and mitigate the risk that we spend too much time building the
					wrong thing.<br />Also, no one gets any value from your work, including your company, until you
					deliver
					it.<br />So the longer you take to deliver, the longer you wait to get revenue, and maybe the more
					time
					the competition has to get ahead of you.<br />These may look very software-oriented, but if you
					replace
					the word “software” with “deliverables” or “solutions,” these can apply to almost any
					project.<br />For
					example, deliver working solutions frequently.<br />See?<br />The value theme is also about
					simplicity.<br />How much time do you think it takes engineers to add all the buttons and features
					to
					products that ultimately end up confusing the user?<br />Simplicity allows a team to focus and work
					on
					the things that matter the most.<br />An example of this theme in action might be prioritizing
					getting
					feedback on a product prototype, so you know which features really matter.<br />Or it might mean
					ensuring the team only works on approved features and doesn’t spend time on unnecessary
					ones.<br />Another example might be reserving 10% of the team’s time to work on bug fixing or
					polishing
					a process, which should help you go faster in future iterations.<br />The next theme is business
					collaboration, and includes two more principles.<br />Quick note.<br />One of the principals uses
					the
					term “business people” to refer to those involved with things like sales, marketing, customer
					support,
					and account management.<br />We’ll use the term “developers” to refer to those who are involved with
					making and creating products.<br />OK, so we discussed customer collaboration during the values
					discussion, and here we are again.<br />Collaborating with your customers helps the team get
					critical
					business information immediately, allowing them to adjust and adapt to any new information
					instantly.<br />No matter if it’s realized early or late in the project, customers will get what
					they
					want to achieve their business goals.<br />You could achieve collaboration by making sure that
					business
					people work near the development team, ideally in the same office or virtual space.<br />If that’s
					not
					possible, maybe co-locating a day a week, encouraging instant messaging, or blocking off time on
					your
					team calendars each day or week to collaborate.<br />The goal is to enable easy access between
					business
					people and developers.<br />Another example might be how you handle feedback and changes in
					priorities.<br />Rather than trying to keep the customer away from developers due to concerns about
					scope creep, create a weekly huddle where customers and business people can explore feedback and new
					ideas with the team.<br />This could be a great way to discover that one really valuable feature is
					super easy to build, whereas another feature the users thought would be easy is actually really
					hard.<br />Our third theme is team dynamics and culture, and includes four more
					principles.<br />Remember, the first Agile values stresses individuals and interactions over
					processes
					and tools.<br />Notice that the principles in this theme reflect that value.<br />This theme
					emphasizes
					creating an effective team culture that is inclusive, supportive, and empowering.<br />Having an
					effective team culture is essential to a project’s success.<br />These principles really boil down
					to
					making sure your team is motivated to do the right thing, feels trusted to do the right thing, has
					the
					resources and space to work closely together on their goals, and works at a sustainable
					pace.<br />An
					example of emphasizing effective team culture would be to ask the team what kind of equipment they
					need
					to do their job, and then giving them those tools.<br />Another manifestation of this theme is
					letting
					teams write their own processes and templates, rather than forcing them to use something from
					headquarters.<br />Teams work best when they feel like their input is valued, so you, as the project
					manager, should make space for your team to engage and actively contribute to the team
					culture.<br />You’ll build trust and empower them to approach their work in a way that suits them
					best,
					which in turn will allow them to work more productively.<br />Finally, the fourth theme is
					retrospectives and continuous learning.<br />The last principle stands alone in this theme, so I’ll
					read
					it aloud.<br />“At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes
					and
					adjusts its behavior accordingly.” This one sits on its own because I want to draw attention to how
					important it is for Agile teams to continuously learn and adapt to what’s working and what’s not
					working
					for them.<br />Teams should always be figuring out better ways to work, and it’s really valuable to
					set
					this time aside after each iteration to focus entirely on how to improve.<br />In these sessions,
					the
					team can step back and consider questions like, how is the team doing?<br />Are the customers
					happy?<br />Are there processes we could optimize?<br />Are our tools working for us?<br />Are we
					following the values?<br />Are we accumulating any debt?<br />And by debt, I mean processes or
					technology that slows us down.<br />We’ve officially finished discussing the Agile
					Manifesto.<br />It’s
					amazing to think that these four values and 12 principles are the foundations of so many advances in
					project management.<br />I’ll come back to these values and principles throughout the rest of this
					course to demonstrate how these connect to the day-to-day activities of an Agile project.<br /></p>
