					Are you ready to learn real life English with comprehensible input? Well, good, because today we're
					going to talk about something that every person needs to know how to talk about. The bathroom.
					Today we're going to talk about the bathroom. Let's go. Okay guys, today we are going to work on our
					English with comprehensible input. What is comprehensible input? Comprehensible input is when a
					native speaker like me speaks nice and slow and clearly so that you can understand. Okay? And that
					is how we naturally improve our English. <br>
					And today guys, I am going to show you guys things and teach you words that you will never learn in
					an English course.<br>
					You will never see in an English grammar book. I got you guys. I'm going to take good care of you
					today. I'm going to tell you everything you need to know to talk about using the bathroom, things
					that you will find in the bathroom. This is going to be a useful video, maybe a fun and funny one,
					too. So, let's start over here. This is called a sink. A sink. Okay. The sink is actually the part
					where the water goes in. This part is called a faucet. You turn on the water. Okay. What else do you
					do over here at the sink? Well, after you use the bathroom, you wash your hands with soap. You wash
					your hands. Then you dry your hands to dry to get the water off to dry your hands. And guys, one
					thing real quick I need to say thank you to my beautiful camera wife. She cleaned the bathroom for
					us, guys. She cleaned the bathroom so we could make this video.<br>
					So, thank you, baby. What else do you do here at the sink? Well, over here we've got our
					toothbrushes. Okay, this is a toothbrush and you use it to brush your teeth. Get it wet. This is
					called toothpaste.<br>
					And guys, it just so happens that I need to brush my teeth right now. So, we'll put our toothpaste
					on the toothbrush. Brush our teeth.<br>
					Okay, guys. Now, I brushed my teeth. But while we are talking about teeth, what else do you do with
					your teeth in the bathroom? Wife, floss. Floss. All right, guys. This is flossing. Flossing is when
					you clean in between the two teeth.<br>
					Okay.
					Like this. That's flossing. I need to floss. But guys, this is called a floss pick. A lot of times
					people just buy the little string, the the little piece of floss and it does not have this plastic
					part and they do it like this and clean between all their teeth. Flossing is very good for you. I
					need to floss. Give me a second, guys. All right, guys.<br>
					Another thing that some people use, you don't really have to use this, but some people like to so
					that they could get their breath fresher. This makes your breath smell good. makes your breath smell
					good. And it's called mouthwash because you're washing out your mouth.<br>
					So, what you do is you And now I'm ready to kiss my wife. All right, guys. What else do we have in
					here? This is called deodorant.<br>
					And you put it on your armpits so that they do not smell bad. Okay. This is very important. Here we
					have lotion to make your skin soft. You put lotion on your skin. Oh, something else that you might
					do at the sink, you might do in here. We're going to talk about this in a minute, don't worry, is to
					shave. To shave. Okay, this is called a razor. And you use it to shave. I need a shave, actually.
					Use it to shave your beard, your facial hair. Some guys shave their head. Women, some women shave
					their legs. Some women, like my camera wife, sometimes they don't. This is called a razor, guys. A
					razor is for cutting hair. This is a men's razor. So, usually it's for the hair on your face to
					shave.<br>
					To shave your face. Another thing that I do over here, brush. Brush my hair. I brush my hair here so
					I can see myself in the mirror. This is a hairbrush and you use it to brush your hair. Now,
					something else that I sometimes do over here, I put in my contact lenses. So, these are called
					contact lenses, but most people say my contacts. Put in my contacts. Okay. Most of the time I wear
					my glasses so that I could see because without my glasses or without contacts I can't see very good.
					Okay. I certainly cannot drive. I I could see my wife right now but I can't see how beautiful she
					is. But now mama now I see she's beautiful. Oh. All right guys. So, when I don't want to wear my
					glasses, when I do not want to look like a nerd, I take my glasses off and I put my contacts in. Put
					my contacts in.<br>
					These camera wife, what are these called, guys? I might make a bet. I might make a bet that there is
					not another English video on YouTube that tells you what this is called. I I bet nobody else is
					telling you what these are called. These are called Q-tips.<br>
					Q-tips and they're little sticks with cotton on them and you use them to clean your ears. Guys, I
					have a funny story.<br>
					My ears are clean, by the way. See, I'm happy. Oh, I'm so happy I didn't pull them out and they were
					like yellow. Oh, that would have been embarrassing, guys.<br>
					Oh, you would have all thought, "Oh, Kyle is nasty. He never cleans his ears.
					Yuck." Thank you that my ears are clean right now.<br>
					Wow, guys. I got lucky. Anyway, let me tell you a short funny story. One time when I was maybe my
					son's age, maybe eight or nine years old, I walked into the bathroom and I saw my mom. She was
					cleaning her ears, okay? I didn't really know, you know, what these were, how you clean your ears. I
					was probably younger.<br>
					I was probably like six and she had two.<br>
					She was doing this and guys, I thought it was one long one. I thought that she had one one big Q-tip
					and it was going all the way through. Like I I really thought that my mom stuck a big stick all the
					way through her ears and through her head. I was like, "What?" That's a real story. That's a real
					story. All right, guys. Moving over this way. We've got these cabinets here. Cabinets here.
					And behind the mirror is another cabinet. Okay, a cabinet is something that you can put things in. A
					lot of times in a bathroom, they will call these the medicine cabinet. Why would they call it the
					medicine cabinet? Cuz they put medicine. People put their medicine. Okay. People put their medicine
					in it a lot of times. I remember growing up, my mom would always put her medicine in the medicine
					cabinet in the bathroom. Over here, we have some perfumes that my wife uses to smell good. I bought
					her this one. Smells good. We have other girly stuff. Girly things. So, I say girly things, but
					really there's nothing girly or feminine about taking care of your skin, being very clean. But my
					wife is definitely a lot better at taking care of her skin than I am. She has all these different
					products. This is a a face cleaner.<br>
					She has moisturizers.
					She has this to protect her from the sun. She always says, "Use the sunscreen on your face." I say,
					"This this right here, it's called a toilet." All right, guys. Now, this part of the video isn't
					going to be very polite, very nice, but we need to know how to say these things, right? So, what do
					you do in a toilet?<br>
					My wife's laughing right now, but this is serious, guys, because we're humans, right? We have to
					talk about these things. So, I talked myself into something. Now I have to do it.
					Okay, guys. I don't want to talk a whole lot about this. So, I'm just going to tell you two very
					simple things. Okay?<br>
					Going to the bathroom is a very nice way to say it. Okay? You can say, "I need to go to the bathroom
					or I need to use the bathroom." All right? That's a nice way to say that you need to come and do
					what you have to do in here. Okay? Little kids sometimes they don't have very good manners and they
					will say, "I have to go poop." Okay, that's poop. That's what going poop means. Okay? And when my
					son was little, he'd be like, "I have to poop." And that means that he's coming to do what he has to
					do in the toilet.<br>
					So, I had to tell him, "Don't say that.
					Just say, I need to use the bathroom." That's much more polite. Okay? I need to use the bathroom.
					Over here we have toilet paper. What do we use toilet paper for? To blow your nose. To blow your
					nose. That's what you use toilet paper for, right? And to clean your butt. Toilet paper is used to
					clean yourself up after you use the toilet.<br>
					Okay, this is the toilet. You do what you have to do in here. You put the toilet paper in there and
					then you flush the toilet.<br>
					That is called flushing the toilet. You flush the toilet and whatever you just did goes away. The
					toilet is a great invention, guys. For real. Imagine if we didn't have the toilet. My wife is
					laughing so much at me right now, guys.<br>
					I'm trying to make this fun for you, but really it is super important to know all these things
					because if you find yourself in a different country and you don't know how to say, "I need to use
					the restroom." Or you're in a hotel and there isn't any more toilet paper.<br>
					That's a problem, guys. You know, you need to be able to say, "Hey, I need more toilet paper. Hey, I
					need some soap. Hey, the toilet is not working." Okay? You need to know how to say these things even
					though it's not fun to talk about. So, I'm just trying to make the best of it. The shower. This guys
					is called a shower curtain. Okay? We use the shower curtain so that when we take a shower, the water
					does not come out.<br>
					All right? So, two different important verbs. Okay? To shower, to take a shower, and to bathe, to
					take a bath. Do you know the difference, beautiful camera wife? Well, she does because I taught her
					good. All right, guys. When you fill the tub up with water and you sit in there, you sit in here,
					clean yourself up like that in the water, that is called a bath. Okay? But when you turn this, this
					is called a shower head.<br>
					When you turn this on and you stand under there, you clean yourself up. That is called taking a
					shower. Okay? These are towels you use to dry yourself off.<br>
					If you could dry your hair now, things that are normally in the bath. Legos.
					Legos are normally in the bath, right?<br>
					These little Lego toys that you could build things with. Well, I don't think Legos are normally in
					the bath, but Legos are normally in my bath because my son wants to bring his toys in here when he
					takes a shower. So, he should be worrying about cleaning himself. But he likes to hang out in here
					and build things cuz he's super smart and super good at building things. So he likes to build things
					even when he's taking a shower. Now normal people in their baths will have soap. Okay? Soap you
					clean your body with. Shampoo. Shampoo is what you clean your hair with. And conditioner is what you
					can use after the shampoo to make your hair soft and beautiful like my lovely camera wife's hair. I
					don't like using these that much, guys, because I feel like it makes the natural oils in my hair go
					away and it makes my hair look weird and feel weird. So, I just use very hot water and wash all the
					wash my hair like that. But my wife thinks that she needs thinks no.<br>
					She needs this. She needs this. She needs this and this. Okay. She thinks she needs all these
					things. Can you say this? Oh, this. Okay, guys. So, this is shaving cream. How does it work? All
					right, guys. This is shaving cream that my wife uses for her legs. Probably once a month she'll
					shave her legs, maybe.<br>
					Just kidding, guys. I'm just joking with my wife, guys. My wife takes good care of herself. But this
					is uh a shaving cream for your body mainly. There's a different kind that men will usually use for
					their face. A lot of times I'll just use whatever is in here. Sometimes I use shampoo because I'm a
					savage, guys. I'm a savage. I don't care. All right, guys.<br>
					Here's another good one that has to do with the toilet. Wife, what is this thing called? Before I
					start, guys, let me tell you, our toilet works very good.<br>
					We never use this, okay? Touch my life with it cuz it's clean. So, this is called a plunger. Okay?
					And this could be useful to know, too. All right? If your toilet is overflowing, the water's coming
					out, you need a plunger. You use this to to make the water in your toilet go down. Okay? Uh
					sometimes a lot of toilet paper will get stuck in the toilet and the water starts to come out.
					So, when that happens, you plunge it.<br>
					Okay? Thankfully, we never had to plunge our toilet. So, we have a clean plunger.
					All right, guys. That is everything except for one thing that I want to say for the women. Okay? So,
					if you're a man who does not want to see something that has to do with feminine hygiene, you don't
					have to watch this part, but it's important for the ladies, okay? Because I know my wife had an
					issue with this.<br>
					When she came to this country, she did not know how to say these things. And you can imagine that's
					a difficult situation.<br>
					So this is women's hygiene. Okay. A woman will use this when she has her period and they are called
					pads. Okay.<br>
					You could call these pads. And uh ladies, you know what to do with these.
					Do I need to explain it? Anyway, just so you know, this might really help you ladies one day. If
					you're in another country where they speak English and you need one of these, I imagine you're going
					to have to know how to say it.<br>
					That's called a pad. Okay, for the ladies out there, I appreciate you all watching. All right, guys.
					The bathroom.<br>
					You have to know how to say these things, guys, because something that all humans, all people, no
					matter what language you speak, we all have in common.<br>
					Thank you guys for watching.
