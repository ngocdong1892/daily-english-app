					hello my friends and welcome back to pensando engl I am Kyle and here on my channel pensan Eng I
					make videos in English that you can understand okay because I know how hard it can be to learn a new
					language so for that reason three times at least poos three times a week I bring you real English
					real English that you can understand and use as comprehensible input to help you on your English
					learning journey and I talk about real life things interesting topics funny topics scary topics talk
					about food talk about relationships talk about love talk about hate we cover everything here on this
					channel okay I think now there's over 600 videos so please if you want more English in your life
					check out my videos you are in the right place believe me so guys today we're going to talk about
					the best decision that I ever made in my whole life and it was to marry my wife okay tomorrow
					tomorrow is our first first aniversary which means that we have been married for one year okay my
					wife and I have been married for one year and one year ago I see on your one year ago I made the
					best decision that I ever made in my life okay which was to marry that woman many of you guys know
					who my wife is you've seen her on these videos if you're new here she is that beautiful little
					Latina on the thumbnail o miniatura okay that's my wife in this video I'm going to cover a lot of
					reasons why that was the best decision I ever made I'm going to tell you why I'm proud of my wife
					why I'm happy that that woman is the one who I married and this is a very special video for me guys
					because being married has been a huge Growing Experience in my life okay I've learned a lot I've
					grown as a man as a human being and I'm very happy that I've done it with my wife so if my wife sees
					this before uh before we talk because she's at work sometimes she watches my videos at work I love
					you very much I'm very proud of you thank you for being my wife and spending this last year with me
					I appreciate you so much okay guys let's start off with why I'm proud of my wife why why I'm happy
					that she is the one woman who I am married to my wife is very smart Okay um not just women but a lot
					of people in general you can tell them things all day long you can teach them or try to teach them
					you can you can try and give them advice to improve their life if you see they're doing something
					wrong you could tell them the correct answer on how to fix it and they just okay they can't even
					hear they hear it it goes in one ear and out the other as we say in English which means that they
					are not understanding at all what you're saying maybe they hear you but the information is not
					staying in their brain they don't use it they never make the change not my wife if I learn something
					new about how to be happier how to be healthy or how to handle emotions or how to handle money I
					could tell my wife about it I could teach her about it she will listen and she will actually make
					the change she can actually learn and that's great because I'm trying to learn every day I'm making
					changes every day to improve myself and improve my family's life and I'm very proud that I have a
					partner who can understand this information process it and actually put it into use and and that is
					not all I'm not saying it's not a common trait in women it's not a common trait in younger people I
					feel I've seen a lot of people who maybe they ask for advice or maybe they're just doing dumb things
					in their life and when you give them the advice that you know would make a good positive difference
					in their life they never make the changes I'm proud that my wife can absorb and understand the
					information and put it to use so she's smart another thing that I am very very happy about is that
					my wife never embarrasses me okay now what do I mean by this I mean I've seen a lot of guys friends
					even who when you're around them and you're around their girlfriend or their wife their wife will
					say something mean to him and embarrass him okay so maybe maybe you're all together in a group and
					uh you see somebody who has big muscles okay and then your friends wife will say oh you are not
					strong like that or something like that to completely embarrass him okay now I love that I get get
					to be confident that my wife is not going to embarrass me that is such a blessing I could take her
					anywhere around any people and I know she's not going to say something dumb she's not going to be
					mean to me in front of other people uh you know I'm proud of my wife I'm proud of the things that
					she says because I know that she is going to make me look good okay she's gonna make me look good if
					she says something it's going to be something positive unless we're joking around you know but I'd
					never have to worry about her saying something mean something rude something inappropriate and that
					is something that I am very proud of and something I'm very happy that I know about my wife she's
					not going to embarrass me she's going to act with class okay my wife has class and that is another
					trait that is not as common as maybe it was 50 years ago there are a lot of people in this world
					that do not have class but my wife does and I'm proud of that another reason why I'm proud of my
					wife is that to me she is just gorgeous she is beautiful I love the way that my wife looks and I'm
					proud to show her off okay if if I have to go somewhere I am very proud that I get to bring that
					beautiful woman with me makes me feel good about myself you know uh people are always saying oh
					you're beautiful she's beautiful okay and that makes me feel good obviously that I have a beautiful
					wife and I just like to look at her okay it makes me feel good to look at my wife and be like okay
					Mita so I'm proud that my wife's beautiful in my eyes she is stunning ways that my wife has made my
					life better okay number one she has made my life easier Mas how is my wife made my life more easy
					well before I was married guys I was a single father working uh my hard job you know I've got all my
					my other things going on my other responsibilities and what you don't think about is okay you go to
					work everybody goes to work but if you're a single parent you come home you have to take care of
					your kid you have to cook clean clean the clothes uh you know there's a whole lot of things going
					into this so I was for years cooking dinner every night making sure my son is clean gets his bath
					making sure he eats healthy food making sure he gets to bed healthy and happy making sure he does
					his homework okay doing my clothes making sure that I'm eating right now guys I have a partner to
					split that load with to share that responsibility so today my wife is working okay and I have the
					day off so I'm going to make dinner but if I was working my wife would be making dinner okay so we
					we help each other out when I'm busy she takes up more of the responsibilities when she's busy or
					stressed I take up more of the responsibilities and that is just such a beautiful thing to have in
					your life someone who you can count on and you know I know that if my wife makes dinner it's going
					to be something healthy something delicious something good I know she's going to make extra so I
					could have a lunch tomorrow if I have to go to work work uh you know I know that there's clean
					clothes in my house because of my wife I know that our house will never be disgusting or dirty
					because of my wife and that goes both ways I help her as well but I just that has made my life so
					much easier and so much less stressful to have her to help she helps with my son uh she helps
					everything guys everything I've got a partner partner to share the hard things in life with and that
					means a lot to me I'm a lot happier with my wife guys that's another thing that she has improved
					about my life you know I've got somebody to share the funny things that happen with I've got
					somebody to share my achievements with if I achieve something yeah it's cool but it's so much better
					when I could go tell my wife when I learn something interesting from reading a book or watching a
					video or you know reading a verse from the Bible it's so much more satisfying to share that piece of
					knowledge or that that thing that I achieved with my wife it it's so much more meaningful so much
					more special so I'm a lot happier with her uh guys nothing is perfect and and you know there's times
					when we have to put in work in our marriage but also there's so many special moments where we just
					laugh sometimes my wife and I will just laugh until we cry and you know sometimes it's laughing at
					each other sometimes it's it's whatever guys but it's those little moments of happiness that make my
					life so much better with her in it uh another thing is my life I am so much more successful with her
					in my life let me tell you some some ways that that is true this vehicle that I'm in I used to owe a
					lot of money on okay because here in the US everybody takes loans prestos on their cars okay it's
					stupid you have to pay so much interest but it's what is normal here okay I owed a lot of money on
					this car but when I got with my wife when we got married we decided to put our money together and we
					decided you know what we do not want to be in debt we paid this car off we thought it was going to
					take like a year and a half two years but we worked hard and we paid it off in like 8 months so now
					our marriage does not have debt uh we have saved money guys we're going to Columbia next month we
					saved a little bit a little bit a little bit for the trip all over this last year we've been saving
					a little bit here a little bit there and now guys we've got all of our flights paid off we've got
					our hotels paid off and we've got money saved to have beautiful experiences with my uh my wife's
					family with my son with my wife and guys it's awesome we're going to another country and we're going
					to have incredible experiences my wife and I have money saved up for emergency we're investing in
					our future we're planning to buy a house soon and all this is made possible because my wife is
					working hard and I'm working hard and we work hard together okay and this was just all this would
					have been impossible without her okay because without the money that she brings in the majority of
					my money would have went to bills would have went to buying the food food paying for rent etc etc
					but because of her and her hard work now we're able to save we're able to save and invest in our
					future and that just means means the world it's it's incredible guys it's incredible but that's
					another reason why I know that she's the one for me she's the right woman she's a good woman because
					a good woman is an asset she gives value to your life okay a good woman will make you have more
					money in your life a bad woman bad woman is what is called a liability okay a liability is something
					that takes money from your life okay a bad woman will have you broke broke is a joke which means
					that you have no money okay she will be spending your money she will be getting in trouble and you
					will have to spend money to get her out of trouble a bad woman will ruin your chance es of success
					but a good woman will push you towards success okay uh one other thing that is very special about my
					wife is that she not only makes my life better but she makes my family's life better okay when I'm
					busy at work when my son's with his mother at school not around my wife will go spend time with my
					mom okay she'll go get her and pick her up for lunch and you know maybe maybe you guys are like oh
					well why is that so special well my father's gone you know my mom lives by herself if I'm working I
					can't go see her and hang out with her and my wife goes and spends time with my mom they go to the
					movies together they go get lunch together they just sit around and look at pictures and talk that
					is a good woman guys a woman who will go and spend time with your mom make your family feel special
					and cared for that is a wife and also you know she makes my son feel loved all the time and just
					means so much means so much to me all right guys the last thing I want to talk about uh I always
					like to ask people who know about a certain topic I ask them their advice okay I'm not going going
					to ask a poor guy how to make money and I'm not going to ask a fat guy how to get muscular okay if I
					want a personal trainer he better have bigger arms than me if I want advice from money that guy
					better have some money okay or I'm not asking the advice so when I want advice about marriage I ask
					people who have happy marriages okay I say hey man you know I'm I'm a year into my my marriage I see
					you've been married for 25 years and you still love your wife tell me what can I do what have you
					learned and I've gotten some good tips tip is cono okay I've gotten some good tips from some some
					guys who have had long happy marriages and let me just share at least one with you this one really
					stuck with me uh he was a friend of my brothers and him and his wife they always seem happy okay now
					I know they have their problems too but they've been married for a long time and for the most part
					they seem happy so that's a guy I want to get advice from I asked him I said man you know you and
					your wife you always seem like you're getting along you're doing well they still hang out they still
					go on vacations together they love each other what can I do tell me what have you learned and the
					thing he told me that was really good advice never sleep on the couch Never Leave the Room always
					sleep in the bed with your wife even if you're mad guys you see all the time in movies or your
					friend will say I slept in my car last night I was so mad at my girl or I slept on the couch that is
					the start of the end okay when you walk away instead of putting in the work instead of fighting for
					your marriage that is the beginning of the end okay there have been times where my wife and I were
					furious at each other we were mad at each other we were not agreeing we were not seeing eye to eye
					no aquo and we both probably felt terrible inside we were arguing uh she was saying saying something
					I was saying something and they were not going together and it felt like there was no way we were
					going to agree no way we would ever fix this and this was right before bed guys but you know what I
					wanted to go sleep on the couch and get away from the situation but instead I grabbed my wife I held
					her I said you know what I love you we're going to be okay or there have been and times where I turn
					around like a big baby I'm not getting my way I'm mad so I roll over away from my wife and she'll
					come and hug my back and I know you know what we're going to be all right we're going to get through
					this because that shows hey you know what we're not okay right now I'm upset you're upset but I love
					you and I'm not giving up on us I'm not giving up on our marriage so guys even when things are bad
					do not leave the room that bed is your marriage bed and you know a marriage bed is very important
					guys that's your closeness that's your love that's your communion so don't don't turn away from that
					okay don't turn away from that that's where you and your your spouse come together for peace come
					together for love and never run away from it put in the work if even if you're tired guys and you
					have to stay awake an extra hour talking about it until you guys fix it or at least get to the point
					where you can say you know what maybe we're not going to fix this today but I still love you I still
					want to hold you you know I'm still here for you we'll try again tomorrow okay because sometimes
					we're mad and we're seeing the world through our mad glasses our mad eyes okay and if you just just
					sleep the next day you will not have those chemicals because emotions are chemicals in your body you
					will not have those emotions going on and you will be able to see things a whole lot more clearly so
					that was a beautiful piece of advice that I got from a very good guy all right guys that's a little
					bit about why I love my wife why I'm proud of my wife why I love our marriage and why I think that
					choosing to marry that little adorable woman one year ago was the best decision that I ever made
					okay amigos
