					Hello. Are you ready to improve your English? Well, today you are inside of my refrigerator and we
					are going to improve our English with comprehensible input. What is comprehensible input? <br>
					Comprehensible input is when a native speaker like me speaks in a way that you can understand. And
					today I am going to make a comprehensible input video for you by showing you how I eat every day.
					So today I'm going to show you everything I eat. We are going to talk about food and you are going
					to learn a ton of useful real life vocabulary in English. Are you ready? Let's go. <br> Hey guys, Kyle
					here. I just want to welcome all of the new subscribers who found me on my recent videos or this
					video. And I want to give a big virtual hug and welcome back to all of my loyal subscribers who have
					been watching my videos, some of you guys for years. I appreciate you all very much. So, before I
					show you guys what I eat in a day, let's talk a little bit about diet.
					Okay? And your diet is what you eat. <br>

					Okay? Your diet is what you eat every day, every week, every month. And the thing about diet is
					everybody eats different, right? Some people like to eat little things all day long. All day they're
					snacking. To snack means that you're eating something little. Popcorn, potato chips, candy. Some
					people snack all day. Okay. Some people like to eat the three main meals. Okay. And in English, we
					call the traditional three meals breakfast, lunch, and dinner.<br>
					Breakfast is what you eat in the morning. Lunch is what you usually eat around 12:00 or 1:00 p.m.
					sometimes. and dinner. I would say people normally traditionally eat dinner around 5:00 p.m. here in
					the United States. I know some places they eat dinner very late. I heard that in Spain sometimes
					they eat dinner at like 1:00 p.m. Sounds weird to me. So, before I show you guys how I eat, let's
					talk about how I eat. And you guys are going to get a lot of good vocabulary in this video. A ton.
					So guys, I usually just eat two times a day normally. Most days I eat twice a day.
					Sometimes I eat three, but I never never snack. I never eat snacks, little snacks. And I never eat
					more than three meals a day. So how I eat, usually I eat two big meals. So, on days that I do not
					have to go to work, I usually will eat my first meal around 10 or 11 a.m. Okay.<br>
					I know for some people, they're thinking, "Oh, how do you do that? It's so hard. I would be so
					hungry." And when my wife says that, I tell her, "Man cannot live by bread alone." Just a joke.
					Which means that there's more important things than eating. So, normally I'll eat one meal at 10 or
					11:00 a.m. and then I will eat a big dinner around 5 or 6:00 p.m. with my wife. So, the only times
					that I eat three times a day are when I work early in the morning and then I go to the gym to work
					out before work. Okay? So, if I have to work at 6:30 a.m., I'll go to the gym at 4:30 a.m., work out
					for 1 hour, and then go to work. So, guys, when I do that, I am so hungry. I'm starving. So, guys,
					starving is actually not a good thing. Starving means that you are dying of hunger. You're so hungry
					that your body is dying. It's eating itself. But people say that all the time when they're very
					hungry. They will say, "I'm starving. I need to eat." But now that I think about it, that sounds
					really bad because there are a lot of people in the world who are actually starving. So, but yeah,
					on days where I eat three meals, I eat smaller meals. So, I'll eat a smaller meal after the gym
					before I start working. Then I'll eat another medium-sized meal at lunchtime at work. And then I'll
					eat my big meal after I get home from work. So, another big part of my diet, which I know is not
					good for me, and I'm trying to slow down, coffee. Coffee, guys. I will drink black coffee uh in the
					morning when I'm not eating and it helps me to not be so hungry and give me energy. And there's no
					calories in this.<br>
					I drink my coffee black. No cream, no milk, no sugar. I just like it black.<br>
					All right, guys. Let's show you how I cook and eat pretty much every day.<br>
					Okay, guys. Let's make meal number one.<br>
					Like I said, when I don't work very early in the day and I don't get up very early to go to the gym,
					I usually just eat twice. So, this is going to be the first of my two meals today. All right, let's
					check out our ingredients. Our ingredients, the things that we are going to use to make this meal.
					We have eggs. Going to use a little bit of butter. This is sausage. Pork sausage.<br>
					Now I know that a lot of people all around the world do not or cannot eat pork both for health
					reasons or religious reasons. So if that is your case and you don't or can't eat pork, they make
					sausage just like this out of beef and even out of turkey. So check that out. It's really good, too.
					I just like pork because I like fattier meat because when you're cooking, my friends, fat is flavor.
					I've got some cheese right here. Some really good high quality cheese. And I bought this at a local
					farm by my house. I prefer to buy things from local farms than to go to the big stores because I
					want to support local families, right? That's what you should do. And then we've got these.
					These are wraps. We're going to basically make breakfast burritos or you could call them breakfast
					wraps. Now, we call them wraps because you wrap them up. Now, to wrap is a very useful verb in
					English. You can wrap up burritos.<br>
					You can wrap a present. To wrap is a very useful verb. So, don't forget that to wrap. We are going
					to make a breakfast wrap. So, I'm making some rice right now. I forgot to mention that ingredient,
					but my rice is cooking right now. And while it's cooking, I'm going to get everything ready. All
					right, guys. So, the first thing we're going to do is to grate some of this delicious farm fresh
					cheese. This, my friends, this is called a cheese grater. And you use it to grate to grate cheese.
					Right now, I am grating cheese. Let me grate this cheese and then we'll talk about the next step.
					Okay guys, now that we have our grated cheese, let's crack some eggs. Okay, guys, cracking eggs to
					crack eggs is also something very useful to know in English because many times if you're watching a
					recipe video or a cooking show, they will say to crack eggs. That just means to open up the eggs,
					put them in a bowl. All right, so now I'm going to cook my sausage and my eggs. I'm not going to
					show you all of that because this is not a cooking video. It's just an English video. I just wanted
					to show you guys some very useful verbs like grating cheese and cracking eggs. So, I'll show you
					guys when I'm ready to put this together. All right. All right, guys. It is time to make these
					sausage, egg, rice, and cheese breakfast wraps. I'm also going to teach you guys another very useful
					phrase in English, which is meal prepping. Meal prepping. And we are about to meal prep. What is
					meal prepping? Meal prepping is when you cook one time, but you make meals for more than one day.
					For example, we're going to make one wrap here. I'm going to eat that right now. I'm going to make
					two other wraps right here. But I am not going to eat those today. I'm going to eat those tomorrow
					and the next day.<br>
					This way when I wake up, I do not have to cook. That is the best part about meal prepping. You cook
					one time and then you get to eat for a couple days without cooking again. Meal prepping is cool and
					it helps you to be healthier because if you already have food prepared and ready, you will not be
					thinking, hm, maybe I should eat this this bread, this doughut, this cake, you're going to think,
					no, I already have my healthy meal in the refrigerator. Let me just eat that. All right, guys. So,
					now we're going to put equal parts of all the things we cooked on each thing. Boom. Boom. On each
					rack.<br>
					So, we're going to start cheese. Let's put cheese on each wrap. And I know this looks like a lot of
					cheese. That's because it is. This is a very healthy cheese, and I love cheese. I know some of you
					guys probably cannot eat cheese or drink too much milk because it makes your stomach hurt. That
					happens to my wife, but me, I could eat cheese and drink milk all day and it does not hurt me. So, I
					love dairy. And what is dairy?<br>
					Dairy is what we call any food that is made by milk. Dairy. Dairy products.<br>
					Cheese, yogurt, milk, dairy products.<br>
					Now, the white rice that I prepared, the white rice that I cooked earlier. We're going to put some
					of that on each one. I hope all this stuff's going to fit on these. Now, we've got our eggs. These
					are the eggs that I made. We'll put an equal part of eggs on each one. And last, the sausage. All
					right, guys. Now, let's see if we could even wrap these things up.
					One, two, and three. All right. And with this meal, I'm going to have another dairy product that I
					really like that I bought from local farm. This is called cafir. And kefir is like a yogurt that you
					can drink. It is very good for you.<br>
					And I think it's delicious. Tastes so healthy. All right, let's try the first meal of the day.
					Sausage, rice, and egg, and cheese breakfast wrap.
					M. That's delicious. All right, guys.<br>
					I'll show you when I'm going to make my next meal and the last meal of the day.<br>
					See you in a couple hours. All right, guys. Dinner time. Guess what I'm going to make. Wife, what am
					I going to make?<br>
					Ramen. I'm going to make some ramen noodles. A Japanese dish. You could just buy a little little bag
					that has the ramen noodles in it, but we're going to make it with all these ingredients. It's going
					to be delicious. So, let's go over our ingredients here. We've got some beef. This is going to be a
					beef ramen or a steak ramen. Right here, we have what we call in English mushrooms. This is called
					bok choy. Some of you guys, if you're in Asia, you may know what this is. Bak choy. Got some garlic
					here, some ginger, and we're going to use the broth uh to make the soup. So, first things I'm going
					to do, smash up garlic. Okay.<br>
					And then we need just a little piece of ginger, guys. Ginger is very strong, so you don't need a
					lot. Maybe a piece like that. We're going to get this heating up in a pan, and then we'll get our
					broth going. We'll cut up our other vegetables, and I'll show you guys where we're at in just a
					minute. All right, guys. So, we have our garlic chopped up.
					This is to chop. To chop. We have our ginger chopped up. To chop. To chop.<br>
					Chopping is an important verb. We have our bok choy boiling in water for just a couple minutes. And
					now we're going to put it into some cold water. This is called blanching. You make it softer, but it
					still is a little bit crunchy. You take it out before it gets too soft. And we put in the cold
					water. That's blanched.<br>
					I'm going to put it in the fridge until we're ready for it. The refrigerator, guys. The
					refrigerator. I just said something very native. The fridge. Okay, the fridge. That's what we call
					the refrigerator. If you're a native English speaker, from the US in Britain, they say weird things.
					They probably say, "Oh, get me something from the cold box, mate." Something like that. All right,
					guys. I've got this little pot. This is what our broth is going to go into. It's hot and there's a
					little bit of oil in there. We're going to put our garlic and our ginger in there. Ooh, it smells
					already. And guys, this is going to be delicious. And I want to start this before I start the meat
					because you want to cook this for a little while and let those flavors really get into the broth.
					All right, we're going to let the broth cook for a little bit while I get everything else ready. I'm
					going to cook the meat and I'll show you as we bring it all together and serve up a couple of
					delicious bowls of ramen for my beautiful wife and myself. See you guys in a minute. All right,
					guys. Take the beef out. And now, if you watch any video of somebody who knows how to cook steak,
					they're going to tell you to let it rest. Rest. You got to let the steak rest. Okay? It has
					something to do with if you cut it right away, all of the juices will squirt right out of it. And we
					do not want that. We want a juicy steak. Juicy steak. So, while we let this rest for about 10
					minutes, we're going to start cooking our mushrooms, which I already cut. We're going to cook that
					in the same pan that the steak was in. And then we're going to cook our noodles, and everything is
					going to come together deliciously. See you guys in a minute. Okay guys, everything is starting to
					come together. Now we have to slice our steak. So the difference between the verb to chop and to
					slice.<br>
					Let me explain it. This is chopping. This Come here, wife. This is slicing. That's slicing. That is
					slicing. So we're going to slice the steak. That's slicing. This is chopping. Slice up our steak.
					Oh, that looks good. Oh, I can't wait, guys. cuz I am getting hungry.<br>
					Slicing the steak. Oops. That means the noodles are ready. Right with them. This one is for my child
					who doesn't want to eat ramen. You know how kids are. Drain the water. All right, guys. Time to put
					it all together. Got our noodles in the bowl here. Now, we take our delicious broth. Put that over
					the noodles. I'm only using this to be careful and not make a big mess.<br>
					All right, guys. Now, the fun part. Now, we got to make it look good. So, we're going to take our
					eggs here. Put those here. These eggs came out ugly, but that's okay. So, you know what? Let's just
					show this one. Show the pretty one.<br>
					And we will do some mushrooms. Some of these delicious mushrooms. Oh, we just make them pierce.
					Yeah. Yeah. And then we take one of our bok choys here. Like that.<br>
					And we'll take our steak. And that is a professional bowl of rum. You get it in good light. Wow.<br>
					Okay, guys. That's how I like to eat. We don't eat ramen every day, but my wife really wanted it, so
					I decided to make it for her. Let me know, guys. Do you think it's weird the way I eat? Is it way
					different from how you eat? Tell me in the comments below. I hope that you learned some good
					vocabulary from this video. You enjoyed watching the food that I eat and seeing how some guy on the
					other side of the world likes to eat his food. All right, my friends. Thank you for watching. See
					you later.
