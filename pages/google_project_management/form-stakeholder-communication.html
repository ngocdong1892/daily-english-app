				<p id="1cf468a0-53d4-81d7-be18-d8beb8f11b09" class="">JUANNE: In order to decide who does what on a
					project,
					we have to consider and outline our needs.<br />Choosing the right people for a team is a big task
					and
					one every project manager should take seriously.<br />After all, these are the people who do the
					work on
					the project, so we want to make sure we have the right people lined up.<br />When identifying people
					resources, we need to carefully consider the project needs and use that info to guide our decision
					making.<br />First, a project manager will make a list of roles that they’ll need on their team to
					complete each task.<br />In the same way that a project manager is accountable for the overall
					initiation, planning, execution, and completion of a project, the person in each role is accountable
					for
					specific tasks within the project lifecycle.<br />For example, a home construction project team
					might
					include roles on their lists like an architect, a site manager, and multiple construction
					workers.<br />Once the tasks are clearly laid out, the project manager decides how many people
					they’ll
					need on their team.<br />This can vary greatly depending on the project’s size.<br />For small
					projects,
					the team may only need three or four people to complete the deliverables on time, and for larger
					projects, a team might include dozens.<br />At Google, we sometimes have hundreds of Googlers
					working on
					the same project.<br />Getting the team size right is important for a bunch of reasons.<br />For
					example, when there’s a lot of people on a project, communication sometimes becomes
					difficult.<br />That
					makes it more likely for someone to miss important details.<br />But if your team is too small,
					there
					might not be enough people to finish all the tasks.<br />Once you know how many people you need on
					your
					team, you have to think about who does what.<br />To decide on the right person for each role, a
					project
					manager needs to think carefully about skills.<br />Makes sense, right?<br />If you’re managing the
					construction of a house, you want to know that the construction workers who are building the frame
					or
					installing the drywall have the skills needed to do it properly.<br />It’s on the project manager to
					ensure that everyone on the team has the right skills to do the job.<br />But it’s also important to
					remember that skills can be taught.<br />If someone doesn’t have a certain skill initially, they
					might
					still be a great fit for the team.<br />Maybe this person brings a positive attitude and attention
					to
					detail, perfectly good reasons to have them on your team.<br />Just keep in mind that, if a teammate
					doesn’t have the necessary skills, it’s important that they are trained in time, so not to cause
					project
					delays.<br />When choosing teammates, a project manager also has to factor in each person’s
					availability
					and whether they’ll feel motivated to complete their assigned tasks.<br />For example, you might
					know a
					fantastic site manager who’d make a great asset to the team.<br />But if they’re already staffed on
					another big project, they might not have the time to commit to yours.<br />Or even if they do have
					the
					time, they may not feel like this project will give them the visibility they need for a
					promotion.<br />Motivation is a key ingredient to great work, so it’s a good idea to pick people who
					are
					excited to get involved.<br />But, of course, we don’t always get to choose our
					resources.<br />Sometimes, another manager or team lead might just assign people to roles.<br />When
					this happens, it’s the project manager’s challenge to deliver the best work with what we’re
					given.<br />Let’s check in on our project at Office Green, where we’re rolling out a new
					service.<br />As a project manager, it’s up to you to decide who you need on your team.<br />You
					have to
					ask yourself questions on things like staff experience, availability, the workspace, team member
					workload on other projects, and more.<br />For example, who on the team has office landscaping
					experience?<br />Who’s local to the city where the launch will happen?<br />Who can be fully
					dedicated
					to this project for the next eight weeks?<br />There’s no exact formula for putting together the
					right
					team, which makes it a little tricky.<br />Every situation is different and calls for a different
					set of
					skills, experience, and perspectives.<br />It can be helpful to look deeper into each task on the
					project.<br />Always ask yourself these key questions.<br />How many people do I need on my team
					each
					step of the way?<br />Which team members do I need and when?<br />Are those experts already busy on
					other projects?<br />Who makes the final decisions on project resources?<br />[MUSIC PLAYING] To
					feel
					confident in your team, you need to know each person’s role from the start.<br />Clearly laying out
					the
					responsibilities for each role helps everyone know what project tasks they’re accountable
					for.<br />Odds
					are you can’t complete this project on your own, even if you’re the best project manager of all
					time,
					which we know you will be.<br />Before we jump into the specific roles on a project, we want to call
					out
					that some roles aren’t fixed.<br />Sometimes team members need to adapt and take on more than one
					role
					at a time.<br />This usually happens if the company is small or resources are limited.<br />For
					example,
					at a small firm you might be the project manager, designer, and marketer.<br />Whether they’re fixed
					or
					not, we always have these project roles– project sponsors, team members, customers or users,
					stakeholders, and, of course, the project manager.<br />Let’s learn more about each of them.<br />A
					project sponsor is the person who’s accountable for the project and who ensures the project delivers
					the
					agreed upon value to the business.<br />They play a vital leadership role throughout the
					process.<br />Sometimes they fund the project.<br />The sponsor will probably communicate directly
					with
					managers and key stakeholders.<br />Team members are the heart of the operation.<br />They are the
					people doing the day to day work and making the project happen.<br />The customers are the people
					who
					will get some sort of value from a successfully landed project.<br />Since the project aims to
					deliver
					something useful to the customers, the customer’s needs usually define the project’s
					requirements.<br />You can think of them as the buyers of the project.<br />In some situations, we
					have
					both customers and users for a project, and we need to differentiate between the two.<br />Simply
					put,
					users are the people that ultimately use the product that your project will produce.<br />To make
					the
					distinction nice and clear for you, think of it this way.<br />A software company has created a type
					of
					software that allows teams to communicate with each other in an instant message
					application.<br />The
					software is purchased by corporation ABC.<br />They are the customer.<br />But the users are
					everyone
					within corporation ABC that will be using the instant message application every
					day.<br />Stakeholders
					are anyone involved in the project, those who have a vested interest in the project’s
					success.<br />Primary stakeholders are people who expect to benefit directly from the project’s
					completion, while secondary stakeholders play an intermediary role and are directly impacted by the
					project.<br />Secondary stakeholders may be contractors or members of a partner organization, but
					both
					primary and secondary stakeholders help project managers define project goals and outcomes.<br />And
					finally, we can’t forget the project manager, the person who plans, organizes, and oversees the
					whole
					project.<br />That’s you.<br />Let’s now plug these roles into our Office Green project.<br />Recall
					that Office Green is a commercial plant company that does interior landscaping and plant design for
					offices and other commercial businesses.<br />We’re launching our new plant service.<br />So if you
					recall, our SMART goal– which must be Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Time Bound– is
					to
					roll out a new service to provide office plants to top clients by the end of the year.<br />There’s
					a
					lot to do when launching a new service.<br />Plants need to be ordered and delivered every few days,
					new
					clients will need to be familiarized with Office Green and its procedures, and there will be ongoing
					updates to the website and app.<br />For Office Green’s launch, our project sponsor is the director
					of
					product.<br />They approve the project’s budget and ensure that everything stays aligned to the
					vision,
					which in this case is that inexpensive and easy to maintain live plants are provided in order to
					improve
					the employee work environments.<br />The team’s made up of people from across departments, and
					they’re
					all working together to support the project.<br />For example, the marketing department has assigned
					some people to the team, because they’ll need to tell customers about this new service.<br />On this
					project, the landscape designer is also the website designer.<br />This is an example of where a
					team
					member plays more than one role.<br />And you, you’re the project manager.<br />You’re the one
					managing
					the information, people, and schedule to carry this project to a successful landing.<br />Our
					customers
					for this project are buyers at offices who might be interested in Office Green services, such as
					office
					managers or procurement teams.<br />However, the users are the employees who work at the offices,
					because they’re the ones who enjoy the plants.<br />And finally, all of these people are project
					stakeholders.<br />Secondary stakeholders won’t play active roles throughout all phases of the
					project,
					but still need to be informed as they are a component of what the project needs to succeed.<br />For
					example, these include Office Green’s investors who are helping to fund the new service launch, and
					the
					Office Green receptionists who will answer a lot of customer questions about the new service once
					it’s
					launched.<br />[MUSIC PLAYING] Primary stakeholders are people who will benefit directly from the
					project’s success, while secondary stakeholders are indirectly impacted by the project’s
					success.<br />Having all these different people involved on a project can get confusing, and that’s
					where stakeholder analysis comes in handy.<br />This is a visual representation of all the
					stakeholders.<br />It helps you avoid surprises, build necessary partnerships, and ensure you’re
					involving the right people at the right time.<br />When done well, your stakeholder analysis helps
					you
					see all the opportunities for success and the potential risks.<br />It illustrates which
					stakeholders
					are taking on which responsibilities, and it can help you include the right people in important
					conversations, which is key to getting the support you need throughout the project.<br />There are
					three
					key steps to kicking off a stakeholder analysis.<br />First, make a list of all the stakeholders
					that
					the project impacts.<br />Then determine the level of interest and influence for each
					stakeholder.<br />And finally, assess their ability to participate and find ways to involve
					them.<br />In the second step, we talk about influence and interests.<br />What do those terms mean
					here?<br />Influence measures how much power a stakeholder has and how much the stakeholder’s
					actions
					affect the project outcome.<br />In our Office Green example, the director of product who first
					initiated the project and oversees new products and services has a huge amount of influence, while
					the
					vendor providing the greenery has less influence.<br />Interest is pretty much what it sounds
					like.<br />How much are the needs of the stakeholder affected by project operations and
					outcomes?<br />For example, Office Green’s human resources department might not have as much
					interest in
					the product launch as the sales department does.<br />The power grid is a super useful two by two
					grid
					used for conducting a stakeholder analysis.<br />We use the power grid to assign each stakeholder’s
					level of importance to the project, measuring their interest and influence.<br />The position of the
					stakeholder on the grid usually determines their active role in the project.<br />The higher the
					interest and influence, the more important the stakeholder is to the project’s success.<br />Without
					their support, it’s unlikely that the project will successfully land.<br />These people are our key
					stakeholders.<br />Now that you have a better idea of each stakeholder’s position on the team, you
					can
					plan how to best manage everyone.<br />There are four different techniques you can use for managing
					stakeholders.<br />The first group of stakeholders are the key players or key stakeholders.<br />You
					find these people in the top right corner of the grid.<br />To best manage key stakeholders, you
					want to
					closely partner with them to reach the desired outcomes.<br />Of course, not everyone’s a key
					stakeholder.<br />But each role, even the non-key stakeholder, gets a spot on the grid.<br />You
					find
					stakeholders with higher influence but lower interest in the top left corner of the grid.<br />To
					manage
					these stakeholders, you want to consult with them and meet their needs.<br />Their opinions and
					input
					are important to the project.<br />The director of product has high influence, but may not be vested
					into day to day activities, and therefore will have a lower interest.<br />Stakeholders with lower
					influence but high interests are in the right bottom corner of the grid.<br />For these
					stakeholders,
					you want to show consideration for them by keeping them up to date on the project.<br />It’s
					unlikely
					they’ll need a say what’s going on, but keeping them informed is important.<br />For example, the
					customer success team may have lower influence but high interest, since they’ll work directly with
					clients on the new product.<br />Last up, we have stakeholders with low influence and low
					interest.<br />You’ll find these in the bottom left corner.<br />They’re the least important of the
					stakeholders, but this doesn’t mean that they don’t matter.<br />It might just be that, for this
					particular project, they aren’t as integral.<br />So for this project, you mainly want to monitor
					them,
					keeping them in the know.<br />Creating a grid like this is an effective way to track who should be
					communicated with and when.<br />This grid here is an example of how that might play out, depending
					on
					the project and the stakeholders.<br />You may also want to create a steering committee made up of
					high
					influence and high interest stakeholders.<br />These people will be the most senior decision making
					body
					on any project.<br />They have the authority to make changes to budget and approve updates to
					timeline
					or scope.<br />The project manager isn’t a member of the committee, but they’re responsible for
					bringing
					the right project information to the steering committee so that decisions can be quickly
					made.<br />How
					you engage your stakeholders from this point on depends on your particular situation.<br />There are
					different ways to involve each stakeholder, and you have to be strategic to get helpful and relevant
					input from the right people at the right time.<br />You want to meet with some stakeholders every
					single
					day, and others you just send periodic updates to.<br />Stakeholder buy-in is the process of
					involving
					these people in decision making to hopefully reach a broader consensus on the organization’s
					future.<br />To get stakeholders to buy in on the project, you’ll have to pay particular attention
					to
					your high impact stakeholders and make sure they feel looped in.<br />You want to explain to them
					how
					the project will help them achieve their goals, and you’ll want to have their support later on if
					any
					issues come up.<br />Here are some important things to keep in mind when communicating with
					stakeholders.<br />If you have one main stakeholder, that stakeholder is likely to be highly
					influential
					and needs constant communication.<br />But if you are on a larger project with numerous
					stakeholders,
					they won’t be quite as involved in the day to day tasks.<br />For stakeholders who need time to make
					decisions about the project, overcommunicate early on.<br />For example, hold frequent meetings and
					send
					daily end of day progress emails.<br />This way, they have enough time to weigh the options and make
					decisions.<br />Think about the level of project details each stakeholder needs.<br />You don’t want
					to
					spend time diving deep with stakeholders that just need a project summary.<br />For example, the
					facilities team that delivers the product doesn’t need daily updates on vendor pricing or website
					issues.<br />On the flip side, do spend time updating key members that need frequent
					updates.<br />The
					sales team will need to know pricing and availability changes, so a weekly check in might make sense
					here.<br />[MUSIC PLAYING] In the last video, we saw how a stakeholder analysis shows us how to best
					work with stakeholders and when to communicate with all the different people involved in the
					project.<br />In this video, we’re going to check out another handy tool called a RACI chart.<br />A
					RACI chart helps to define roles and responsibilities for individuals or teams to ensure work gets
					done
					efficiently.<br />It creates clear roles and gives direction for each team member.<br />There are
					four
					types of participation included in a RACI chart.<br />These are Responsible, Accountable, Consulted,
					and
					Informed.<br />Let’s take a look at each.<br />Responsible refers to those doing the work to
					complete
					the task.<br />Accountable refers to those making sure the work gets done.<br />Consulted includes
					those
					giving feedback, like subject matter experts or decision makers.<br />And lastly we have informed,
					which
					includes those just needing to know the final decisions or that a task is complete.<br />Here’s an
					image
					of how this breaks down in a chart form.<br />When creating your RACI chart, you’ll need to write
					down
					each task or deliverable for your project, and then assign it the appropriate role for each
					stakeholder.<br />To do this, first, think about who’s involved in the project.<br />Write the roles
					or
					people’s name in a row across the top of your chart.<br />Pro tip, use roles rather than names if
					some
					people might take on more than one role.<br />Next, write down the tasks or deliverables in a column
					on
					the left.<br />Try not to get too specific here.<br />You want the chart to be simple and easy to
					read.<br />After that, go through each task and deliverable and ask, who’s responsible for doing
					this?<br />Who’s accountable if it doesn’t get done?<br />Who will have strong opinions to add, and
					therefore should be consulted about how this gets done?<br />And who needs to be informed of the
					progress or decisions made about this?<br />Assign the letters R, A, C, and I based on your
					answers.<br />For example, as a project manager on Office Green’s new service launch, one of your
					tasks
					is to create different price points for different packages and delivery frequencies.<br />The head
					of
					finance will be accountable, because the project needs to stay in budget and make money.<br />But
					it’s
					the financial analyst who’s responsible if they’re the person doing the work in determining optimal
					pricing.<br />The director of product will be consulted on the matter, as they oversee the product
					offerings.<br />And finally, team members, like those on the sales team, need to be informed of the
					final pricing.<br />It’s possible there are several roles that fall into the informed and consulted
					categories.<br />One thing that will always remain constant is there will never be more than one
					person
					designated as accountable.<br />This prevents confusion, because having one person accountable
					clearly
					defines ownership.<br />However, the same person that is accountable may also be
					responsible.<br />There
					are several other factors that can cause role confusion.<br />For example, there might be unbalanced
					workloads, which means some people might be doing more work or less work than others on the
					team.<br />Or there could be an unclear hierarchy, when people aren’t sure who to seek help from if
					a
					task doesn’t get done, or unclear ownership of decisions where people aren’t sure who makes the
					final
					call on a project.<br />Another issue could be overlapping work.<br />This is when teams or
					individuals
					feel that they’re responsible for the same work.<br />When this happens, things can get confusing
					fast,
					and the same goes for excessive communication.<br />While communication is usually a good thing, too
					much communication can actually make things more complicated.<br />It can cause information
					overload,
					where people don’t know what to pay attention to, so they miss something important.<br />Wow,
					there’s a
					lot of things that might cause confusion.<br />But all these issues can be resolved or even
					prevented
					with a RACI analysis.<br />Be proactive and do this work upfront, and you’ll help ensure the success
					of
					your project.<br />ROWENA: Congratulations on finishing this video in the Google Project Management
