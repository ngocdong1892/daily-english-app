					learn how to roll my RS I had I used to say things like per Ro per Ro per per per per it's it's a
					process guys so how you say it now per okay that's just an exercise for yes practicing that r s per
					row but an English speaker can't do that and when you first start it's like per per Coro yes Coro
					Coro and it took a lot of practice to do that so if this one's giving you guys trouble I'll do it
					real slow CH chir I think it's the ey part yes choir choir chir May we said like you know so it's
					just like choir mhm choir that R it's the r okay guys number 11 strengthen what that is that

					good architecture architecture temperature temperature temperature temperature temper no temperature
					temperature temperature so you're saying that pretty good but when you first started English do you
					think that would have been hard for you yeah yeah I think so maybe the r temperature uh-huh okay so
					temperature temper temperature what is it where is that temperatures like oh temperat I was like
					okay yes temperature the next is two words but they're both very similar through and throughout so I
					know through through through through through through th the r r th th th through through through
					that's like I had to do to roll the RS per per per th th th through through through th r r through
					through through through throughout through out that's why I married her she's so smart all right
					guys this is uh the day of the week that might be the hardest to pronounce in English Wednesday
					mirac Wednesday is it right Wednesday No you said it right Wednesday so guys if you're reading this
					word it looks like wedes wedes but we say Wednesday so it sounds like Wes Wednesday Wednesday simp
					Wednesday but if you're reading it that's where the problem comes in and you say wednessday wedes
					day but it's Wednesday Wednesday okay guys and we are going to go over a couple more that are
					problems that we've noticed in our conversations and her English is getting so good that now we just
					have to work on the tiny little things and I know that's the case with a lot of you guys too all you
					have to do is Polish up a couple couple little things and people are going to say wow your English
					is incredible okay okay right so a word that she said the other day and to me to my English-speaking
					native ear it sounds so obvious but to her she can't hear the difference so what what is it hey Meo
					yeah twin so she was saying twin now she's fixing it is is okay now it sounded a lot better but when
					she first said it she was saying twin twin like that why do you say it perfect now no I we start
					making the video and she says it perfect I talked to this woman for like 25 minutes that's why I
					can't see the difference like I thought that was like very wrong to say like to say say twin the
					other day I sat there for like 30 minutes listening to this woman say twin so that means your your
					your your your work is is working okay guys so say this word twin twin okay and if maybe you are
					having the same trouble that she was and it sounds like twim twim say it with a hard n at the end
					twin twin twin twin Perfect all right guys yeah she said it right that's how you say it twin guys I
					hope this video was fun entertaining but most of all useful for you guys hope you got to hear some
