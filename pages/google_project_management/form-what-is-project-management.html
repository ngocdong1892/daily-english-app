					success
					of projects both big and small.<br />So let’s break it down into the what, the why, and the
					how.<br />So
					what is project management?<br />Why is project management an important part of an
					organization?<br />And how is it vital to a project’s success?<br />As I mentioned, project
					management
					is the application of knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to meet the project requirements and
					achieve the desired outcome.<br />Project management is valuable to businesses because it helps
					ensure
					that a project delivers the expected outcomes, both on time and within budget.<br />To demonstrate
					what
					I mean, I’ll take you through a real life example of project management.<br />Imagine a school
					district
					signs a deal with a telehealth company to make sure students don’t have to miss school for simple
					health
					issues like fevers or headaches.<br />The deal will be completed by the end of the school
					year.<br />The
					students can now interact with the doctor through a tablet, smartphone, or computer while they’re at
					school.<br />Implementing this technology into the school’s procedures is the project.<br />It’s got
					a
					clear outcome and start and end date.<br />So how is that project managed?<br />Well, this project
					has
					several tasks and each one has to be carefully planned out and tracked, or managed, in order for the
					project to be completed.<br />For example, to start you can organize training sessions for faculty
					to
					get them better acquainted with the technology, policies, and procedures.<br />You can budget for
					tablets, computers, and other vital equipment to facilitate the virtual checkups.<br />And you can
					maintain strong communication with doctors, the telehealth company, and school staff members, and so
					much more.<br />To successfully launch the product in the schools, all of those things need to get
					done,
					and that is project management.<br />Seems pretty important to an organization’s success,
					right?<br />More and more, companies are starting to understand how project management can save them
					lots of money and time.<br />Poor project management can lead to trillions of wasted dollars every
					year
					for organizations around the world.<br />More specifically, poor project management can lead to 48%
					of
					projects missing delivery dates, 43% missing budget targets, and 31% failing to meet an
					organization’s
					goals.<br />As a company that serves so many different purposes and communities, it’s no surprise
					that
					project management is a huge part of Google.<br />But here, many of our project managers are
					described
					as program managers because they manage multiple projects for specific products, teams, or
					programs.<br />There’s thousands of people here with the job of keeping projects and programs
					running
					smoothly, people like me.<br />I’m a responsible innovation program manager.<br />My team is
					responsible
					for ensuring that the technology we produce, the research we pursue, and the publications we put out
					are
					all done with Google’s artificial intelligence principles in mind.<br />I review the processes for
					each
					of these types of technologies and I give ideas for how to continue innovating responsibly to meet
					our
					organizational goals.<br />So my job adds value to Google through the core aspects of project
					management
					we’ve mentioned, planning and organizing, managing tasks, and budgeting and controlling
					costs.<br />Hopefully you have a better sense of what a project is, what project management is, and
					why
					project management is an important part of every company, and how it’s vital to a project’s
					success.<br />Next up, we’ll learn more about what a project manager does.<br />Project managers
					usually
					follow a process that involves planning and organizing, managing tasks, budgeting, and controlling
					costs
					and other factors.<br />Everything they do helps make sure the project can be completed on time and
					on
					budget.<br />In broad terms, a project manager also needs to make sure that the project outcome is
					bringing value to the company.<br />A project manager can add value in many different ways, whether
					that’s creating a new service for customers or modifying an old service so it’s more tailored to the
					customer’s needs.<br />No matter what the task is, a successful project will always add
					value.<br />And
					it’s the project manager’s job to make sure that project is both valuable and successful.<br />You
					may
					be asking yourself, well, if I’m a project manager, how do I add value to an organization every
					day?<br />What does the day-to-day life of a project manager look like?<br />Well, a project
					manager’s
					responsibilities can vary depending on the project, the industry, and the company they’re working
					in.<br />Are you constructing a new building?<br />Are you project managing a renewable energy
					product
					in a startup?<br />Or are you setting up your own event management company?<br />Your tasks will be
					different in each scenario, but here’s a general overview of what a typical day might look
					like.<br />A
					project manager’s daily responsibilities always include some version of the following, planning and
					organizing.<br />An example of that might be gathering requirements from teammates or
					customers.<br />This means figuring out what exactly your project is trying to accomplish.<br />You
					might have a kickoff meeting or send a survey.<br />From here, you may also work on creating project
					plans.<br />Creating project plans is a key part of project management.<br />It helps set the tone
					of
					the project, keeps everyone on pace and aligned, and helps move tasks along.<br />Which leads me to
					my
					second point, managing tasks.<br />Once the project is underway, the project manager helps manage
					tasks
					for the team members and communicates key milestones to the larger team or customers.<br />This
					helps
					keep team members and customers updated on how the project is progressing.<br />The third piece is
					budgeting and controlling costs and other factors.<br />Managing the budget and controlling costs is
					a
					common responsibility that project managers have to understand to keep the project on track and
					within
					budget.<br />This is a full time job because the plan you’ve created and managed may change, causing
					unexpected costs to come up.<br />And that’s just to name a few.<br />I could go on for days, but
					the
					most important thing to know about the day-to-day of a project manager is this, you’ll use different
					tools, techniques, and methodologies every single day.<br />There’s never a dull
					moment.<br />Personally, my favorite part about being a project manager is that I get to watch the
					project’s growth from start to finish.<br />It’s really special to create something from nothing,
					working from the ground up.<br />It’s a really satisfying feeling.<br />[MUSIC PLAYING]<br /></p>
