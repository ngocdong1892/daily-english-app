					project manager is and describe how they add value to their teams and organizations.<br />Let’s
					start
					with the definition.<br />Project managers shepherd projects from start to finish and serve as
					guides
					for their team, using their impeccable organizational and interpersonal skills every step of the
					way.<br />As you learned earlier, project managers usually follow a process that involves planning
					and
					organizing, managing tasks, budgeting, and controlling costs so that the project can be completed
					within
					the approved frame.<br />We’ll dig deeper into these topics throughout this program.<br />What you
					need
					to know right now is that project managers play a crucial role in their organizations.<br />Project
					managers add value to their teams and organizations in key ways that include prioritization,
					delegation,
					and effective communication.<br />So let’s break these down.<br />First, we’ll discuss
					prioritization.<br />Project managers add value to their teams and organizations through effective
					prioritization of tasks required to complete a project.<br />They’re experts at helping team members
					identify and break down large tasks into smaller steps.<br />There will be times when a project
					manager
					may not know which task to prioritize.<br />To determine which ones are the most critical to the
					success
					of the project, they’ll connect with their teams and with stakeholders to gather information and
					make a
					plan.<br />Stakeholders are people who are interested in and affected by the project’s completion
					and
					success.<br />Like the leader of an organization, you’ve probably used prioritization to complete
					work
					in the past.<br />In any kind of project, personal or professional, there are tasks with different
					levels of priority.<br />For example, let’s imagine that you’ve decided to rent a house and plan to
					repaint the rooms.<br />You’ve picked out your paint and you’re eager to get started.<br />While it
					may
					be tempting to start painting right away, you’ll need to prioritize tasks like laying out drop
					cloths to
					protect the floors and furniture, applying blue tape to the room’s edges, and much more.<br />Those
					preliminary steps are critical and need to come before painting.<br />Other related steps, like
					choosing
					new faceplates for your light switches, can come later in the process, or be switched out of the
					project
					entirely if you run out of time or money.<br />When you choose to take care of these preliminary
					steps
					before wedging open the paint can, you’re prioritizing the tasks or steps of your
					project.<br />You’re
					also increasing the likelihood that you’ll be satisfied with your newly-painted rooms.<br />This
					process
					is similar for professional projects.<br />When you effectively prioritize important tasks, you set
					up
					your team– and yourself– for a better project outcome.<br />Now, let’s discuss
					delegation.<br />Project
					managers use delegation to add value to their teams and organizations by matching tasks to
					individuals
					who can best complete the work.<br />Let’s return to our house painting example for a second
					here.<br />Painting multiple rooms can be a time-consuming project, so it’s possible that you might
					enlist a few friends to help you get it done.<br />Maybe one friend has professional painting
					experience.<br />Now with that in mind, you might ask her to handle the more challenging aspects of
					the
					project, like painting the ceiling or the detailed molding.<br />You might also schedule her to
					paint
					the molding before another friend paints the walls.<br />So by delegating this task to the person
					with
					the right skills to complete the work and ordering the tasks appropriately, you’re applying
					knowledge of
					your team’s strengths to the planning of your project.<br />That makes sense, right?<br />Finally,
					let’s
					talk about effective communication.<br />Project managers deliver value through effective
					communication,
					both with their team and with key stakeholders.<br />This refers to being transparent, which means
					being
					upfront with plans and ideas and making information readily available.<br />Project managers keep in
					regular contact with their team about the progress of the work and help identify areas where a
					teammate
					may need support.<br />In our house painting example, this might involve checking in with your
					friends
					periodically to ask if they have enough paint or supplies left to complete their
					tasks.<br />Checking in
					regularly means you’ll know if you need to buy more paint before the can is empty, which ensures
					that
					the project stays on track.<br />In addition to keeping up with teammates, project managers keep in
					regular contact with people outside of the team, like company leaders who are invested in the
					project
					outcomes.<br />For example, you might reach out to your landlord to get permission to paint and to
					share
					the days you’ll be working on this project.<br />Though your landlord isn’t directly involved in the
					project’s execution, the outcomes will affect her property, and so it’s important to keep her
					informed.<br />Without your project management skills, you might run out of paint halfway through
					the
					project, your walls might get painted without drop cloths to protect the floors, and your landlord
					could
					be caught off guard about your plans.<br />So it’s a good thing you’re here to keep the project
					running
					smoothly and efficiently.<br /></p>
