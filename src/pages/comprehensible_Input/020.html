					Hello everybody. I like to travel. Do you like to travel? Well, if you enjoy traveling, you're
					likely going to spend a lot of time in hotel rooms. So, today I'm going to show you this beautiful
					hotel room that my beautiful camera wife and I are in and show you all of the vocabulary that you
					will find in a hotel room. So, next time you go to a hotel, you'll be able to say, "That's a table.
					That's a lamp. You'll be ready. All right, let's check out this hotel room.<br>
					So guys, first of all, this was a nice little drive away from our home and it's in the middle of
					nowhere. It's in the Bos, the woods. If you check out the view outside of these windows, you could
					see we're in a forest, guys. We're in the Bos. Beautiful over here. We've got trees, fresh air,
					there's flowers out there, and it was a nice drive to get in here. Beautiful. So, let's check out
					all the things that are in this hotel room.<br>
					Pretty much every hotel room, even though this one is nicer than most of the ones we usually stay
					at, right, camera wife? Yes. So, guys, bed. You know what a bed is. I know. This is a comfortable
					bed. This is a comfortable bed. And this is the biggest size of bed that you will find in a hotel
					room. Camera wife. What size do we call this bed? King. King. We call this a Kyle bed. Oh, I mean a
					king bed.<br>
					You mean this is a king-siz bed. In English, the sizes of the bed, I don't know if it's different in
					Europe, like Britain or other English-speaking countries, but in the US, the sizes are twin, full,
					double, queen, and then king for the bed. So, this is a very soft and comfortable king-size bed. Got
					a little blanket here. This is just a blanket we would call this, but the big blanket on top of a
					bed we call a comforter.<br>
					Comforter. Then we've got our pillows of course, and you put your pillows inside of a pillow case.
					This is called a what, wife? I have no idea how to say this in Spanish either, so it's okay. This is
					a headboard. Cavisto. Cavisto. Now I know.<br>
					So this is a headboard and it's really nice. It's made out of leather. The wall here is made out of
					wood. It's very pretty. Very beautiful. Here you've got a little bedside table. We might call this
					with drawers. Drawers that you pull out. How do you say drawers in Spanish?<br>
					Kahones. Kahones. Mhm. Okay. So it's the same for cabinets like in a kitchen.
					Kahones. Okay. Then we've got a little lamp here. up here. The Mr. Cool. That's just an air
					conditioner, guys. But it is pretty nice because there's also a remote control over here. A remote
					control. So, if it gets warm in here, I could just turn it on and it'll cool off right away. We've
					got some nice little decorations. And something else interesting about this hotel that we're at, not
					just a normal hotel, it's actually a brewery. A brewery means that they make their own beer or
					cervesa. So, these are some of the beers that they have downstairs. Uh later we're going to go down
					to the restaurant and eat dinner and my wife will probably drink a bunch of beers. I don't drink.
					This is called a smoke alarm. And if there's a fire in here and smoke gets up to the ceiling, beep
					beep beep. It's annoying. Here we've got a couple of really nice chairs and a really nice table.
					Actually, it's actually a really sturdy table. I want one of these in our house. Do you see
					everything is by wood? Everything in here is made of wood. That's like the the theme here. I love it
					is that it's like a cabin or cabana in the woods. So, here guys, we've got a really nice wooden
					dresser, drawers, no fumando, couple of glasses if you want a whiskey.<br>
					And this is for ice. Ice. That's an ice bucket, guys. Obviously television, but what do we call
					televisions in English for short? TV.<br>
					TV. Remote controls. Guys, this is a nice little sofa, but it's actually a futon. A futon means it
					can fold down and turn into a bed. So, if you had somebody else here, a friend could sleep here, two
					people there, five or six on the floor. Over here, little coat closet. A mirror with a beautiful
					wife in it. A guys, my wife's so beautiful. Extra pillow up there, I think. Oh, here's a good one.
					All right, guys. Do you know what this is called? Me? You? Of course I know.
					Hangers. This is called a hanger. Don't you guys say ganchos? Ganchos.<br>
					Ganchos. In English, we call this a hanger, guys, because you hang your clothes on it. And to hang
					means kar.<br>
					Wow, look at this. She's so cool. And over here, we've got a little coffee maker, which I will be
					using in the morning. Got your little coffee cups.<br>
					Put them in here. Got some water, a microwave, and a really nice little fridge. Couple of cold cold
					waters in here. Here we've got the basa garbage can, guys. Garbage can. And then to the bathroom.
					Get out of here. What are you doing? Just kidding, guys. Listen, guys.<br>
					I'm a father now, which means that I have to make dad jokes. Do you know what a dad joke is, my
					wife? No. Dad jokes are dumb. And when your dad makes them, you say, "Dad, come on." But I'm a dad
					now. I have to make dad jokes. Sorry, guys. Towels. Towels, guys. We call the big ones towels. We
					call the medium ones. I'm going to turn the other light on. There you go. You see how she tells me
					what to do all the time, guys? That's marriage. What do we call these small towels? Hand towels.
					Hand towels. And what do we call these? I know. See, these little ones we call washcloths.<br>
					Washcloths. Because you usually use these to wash your body. These are for drying your hands after
					using the sink.<br>
					These are for washing your body in the shower usually. Another mirror. We've got the sink. Hot
					water, cold water.
					This is called a faucet. Faucet. Toilet.
					Obviously. Well, what do you call it in Spanish when you you push this and the water goes? I was
					gonna say flash. Guys, my wife has this habit of just saying things in English but with a Spanish
					accent. So, she'd be like, "So, what do you say?" I don't remember. My little gringa. So, guys, to
					flush the toilet. That's what we said.<br>
					Guys, please tell me in the comments what you really say. Okay, guys. This is called a shower
					curtain. What do you call this thing? Shower head. Shower head. And bathtub. And this important,
					guys, you're going to need to know what this is in English because what if you come into your hotel
					room? I know I must. And you don't know how to say it.<br>
					What are you going to say? Do you have more of that paper that you use to toilet paper, guys? Toilet
					paper.<br>
					Important. Important.
					All right, guys. I guess I'm going to take a nap.
