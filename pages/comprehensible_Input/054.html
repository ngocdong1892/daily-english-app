					ah polos con Oscar banosa practica Ingles how are you my friend I'm very good Kyle what about you
					I'm very well I really love to do these conversations so I'm very happy to meet you and I'm very
					excited to see what kind of interesting things we can talk about today yeah that'll be great so
					let's get started excellent so can you tell me a little bit about yourself uh yeah absolutely uh my
					name is Oscar I'm from Colombia I'm 19 years old and you know to be honest I'm a I'm a language
					lover uh so that's why I I also speak other languages uh like Portuguese and I'm also learning
					French and I do tell that you're learning French as well that's very good uh so yeah and I also
					teach English uh as a professor well I teach private lessons you know because English it's one of my
					favorite languages and I was like well why not I mean I want to teach it so that's that's what I'm
					doing now I see now I see why your English is so good all right man that's that's so cool so when
					did you start learning English um actually it was uh six years ago uh when I was at school and that
					I'm a very curious person so the fact that I didn't learn English at school uh I started to just you
					know learn English on my own and just uh when I had you know the possibility to have a very good
					internet connection I was like okay let's give her a shot and I started learning and uh you know
					here we are okay very cool you you mentioned to me before in a comment that or maybe the email that
					you think comprehensible input is a great way to learn languages how did you find out about
					comprehensible input definitely and you know this is this is really funny because I started learning
					English on my own just as everybody else like you know starting grammar drills using uh books and
					all this kind of stuff and that I just studied that for about five months and I got bored and I was
					like well there is no way that this is the only way to learn English so I just went on YouTube and
					uh you know just uh I look for different ways to learn English and one of them was comprehensible
					input and I watch a conference by Stephen crushing that you know is the author of the hypothesis of
					comprehensible input and I was like man this is so fascinating you know it's like very cool just to
					see how can you learn English in a natural way but I did it you know you know three three years like
					that because I didn't study grammar anymore and I started watching a lot of videos on YouTube with
					subtitles and after those three years I realized that that was called comprehensible input yes
					absolutely yeah it doesn't have to be videos like mine where I talk with my hands or draw things if
					you understand it it's comprehensible input and that could be awesome shows on Netflix that could be
					a YouTube video about your hobbies whatever you're into and that's that's the coolest thing about it
					it there's always something interesting that you could find and learn about definitely yeah okay
					super cool so so you teach English as well do you teach online or do you have students at a school
					how do you teach English uh I teach on my own which means I find my own students so I don't work
					from any institution I teach mainly online and I'm gonna tell you something very funny that I I
					found your YouTube channel because of Mr salads you know so I'm uh I follow Mr salaz and I watch all
					his videos and when he uploaded this new video like YouTube channels uh to learn using compressible
					input uh I mean you were one of the greatest YouTube channels that I've ever found because I was
					like oh wow this is so interesting you know and the fact that you are native it makes you so
					wonderful because it's just like a way to create an environment where you just you know absorb
					English natural way yeah and you know I decided to and I wanted to talk to you about it because I
					actually use your videos to teach my students it's like you know I'm I'm an English teacher but I
					don't like to teach in a very uh traditional way so I tell him you know 20 in grammar 80 exposure
					into the language and uh I have like compressible input uh level one it's your videos basic level
					and then we got the intermediate level level two and I just thought well right after this class
					you're going to go to YouTube You're Going to look for the YouTube channel Benson English and then
					you're going to watch as many videos as you as you can because that that's the way to go you know
					just learning a very natural way with him and that's a great YouTube channel so to be honest I I
					really recommend you YouTube channel to everybody thank you so much for that man that makes me feel
					so so happy and so proud that it's helping people who really want to learn and that you you think
					that it's good enough content that you want to share it really I appreciate that so much man that's
					so cool that's why I do all this well that's great man and I really appreciate everything that you
					do because it's really hard just to you know being a beginner in a lane in a language uh especially
					English it's really hard just to find content that it's comprehensible you know because uh to learn
					a language the content uh needs to be compelling and comprehensible and and when I started watching
					your videos I mean I had I had so much fun you know because of your stories um and I was like oh
					okay so that's a very nice way because uh learning English through stories it's some very compelling
					and you can have a lot of fun while doing it you know so it's like okay so this is the right con
					that I can tell my students to follow because uh finally I found a YouTube channel about it because
					I've never found out YouTube channel like that before so that was I was very happy just to promote
					your channel that way excellent super cool man so you you said that you think it's it's great to
					learn through stories it's very compelling I agree I've shared my own experiences and now I like to
					tell stories from you know books or wherever I could find them is there any story that you would
					like to see a video about any I don't know maybe a legend what what would you like to see from my
					content well that's a very that's a very good question man um I don't know I I watch a couple of
					videos of yours it's uh they talk about wisdom and I really love the topic you know because at the
					fact that you're giving us advices and how to improve in our lives I love that so for my point of
					view a great topic that it'll be nice if you talk about your YouTube channel it would be about a
					philosophy but in English oh man that would be awesome because I love it I love the topic I love
					reading books about it and that if you do it well I'm on I'm in it you know I mean I mean and just I
					don't know why excellent excellent thank you for that recommendation and I I will certainly think
					about that and try to make a good video on philosophy that's a very interesting topic thanks okay so
					I do have some questions for you let's see so obviously your profession is you're a teacher you're
					an English teacher but why did you want to start learning English was it because you wanted to
					become a teacher did you want to travel somewhere did you meet a cute girl who speaks English what
					what happened why did you want to learn English yeah uh you know uh when you learn a language uh
					most of the time it's not because of the reason that you wanted to do it it's because of something
					really different uh in my case it was as I said before I'm a very curious boy and I was like you
					know I got internet but most of the information it's in English and uh I love science I I actually
					watched NASA's videos and all this kind of stuff you know related to the solar system and so on so
					when I found out that the best information are the best movies were in English I was like this is
					going to be a challenge you know but at the end I was like okay let's do it let's do it because I
					want to get access to that information because in Spanish it's it's really hard to find really good
					videos you know about the topics that I love to watch so that was I think my main reason just to
					focus on certain English because I was like okay uh it was like a bridge you know to get it like I
					want this and this is the bridge of the language and this is the topic that I want to enjoy so
					English was a connection like a bridge yeah that's that's why okay that's a wow what an intelligent
					interesting answer you were you were searching for knowledge right you're trying to access this
					knowledge this information so that you could learn more that shows me how curious you really are how
					you're always trying to acquire and learn more interesting things that's that's so cool very cool so
					now that you have a high level of English and you're teaching is that what you want to do with your
					English and your future is keep on teaching maybe get more and more students or would you like to
					maybe get a some sort of job in the the science field and uh use your English there perhaps that's
					very nice to hear well um actually by the way um I get a job very soon I'm gonna work as an
					interpreter so in that that field I'm gonna use my you know my skills so I'm just waiting for it and
					uh as a part-time job I'm Gonna Keep teaching English because I mean it's something I really love so
					yeah maybe I'm gonna for now I'm gonna work as an interpreter and keep on teaching English okay
					super cool man so what would that job be or would you be working for a certain company or uh
					interpreting documents online do you know what what kind of work you'll be doing yeah yeah for sure
					well uh the main thing that you have to do is that well I work from home I can work from home
					without any problem and that I'm gonna translate uh calls and video calls on life so it could be you
					know talking about medical stuff Financial stuff and we have a lot of fields so you guys have to you
					know translate back and forth online wow okay man super super cool and uh this this conversation is
					is awesome to me because your English is so so high I could just I I could speak freely and uh I I
					don't feel like there will be any topic we can't talk about that you want to understand yeah thanks
					very cool all right let's see I I really like to to talk about positive things and get some
					positivity going in these conversations so could you tell me something in your life that you're very
					grateful for okay so first of all I'm grateful for my family that they've been a great support in my
					life uh and also I'm very grateful of myself many of the uh making the decision of studying
					languages and uh and craving for knowledge all the time because it makes me feel like wonderful and
					happier because you know uh when you learn you you become a better human being so when you do it you
					you see like things in a very different way so that's why I follow up a lot of philosophy and how to
					live well uh especially I studied the historic philosophy stoicism and I mean it's about real life
					so I'm really grateful that I made the decision of starting now um well right now it actually
					happened this year I'm so grateful to to have fun a very special person for me this year uh my
					girlfriend you know and I'm so grateful for her because uh we think very similarly and uh I don't
					know we kind of connect in a very quick way I don't know that was like I don't know what happened
					but it was very fast um but I'm so grateful because I I have like future plans with her and uh I'm
					planning to do great stuff so yeah I'm grateful for all the stuff so in a nutshell it would be my
					family my girlfriend and all all decisions that I made my life okay man very good excellent very
					good so uh one other thing that we have in common I believe is what a big part of our Lives
					languages are right huge it's for me as well every day every day I'm either trying to help other
					people learn English or I'm practicing my Spanish or my French all of my future plans have to do
					with languages growing this you know right definitely I I understand how you feel about that so how
					about this girlfriend man what's her name well her name is Cara and he's from Colombia as well um
					and I mean she's starting to be an English teacher so you know languages attracts themselves per se
					they attract themselves yeah um so yeah I mean she she loves languages as well uh and she's she's
					traveling to the eu's very soon uh to a camp so she's gonna work a little bit on her English and and
					I helped her uh whenever I can so I mean it's just so much things in common and uh yeah my my life
					it's about languages because people tell me people ask me like why did you spare time I learn
					languages uh well what do you do when you have nothing to do I learn languages uh what do you do I
					teach languages so I mean it's just like a passion for me and I really enjoy it so the fact that my
					girlfriend has some very similar yeah that that's why that's why super cool well hello to Kara uh
					and I'm so happy that you you found someone who you could share your passions with that that really
					can bring you a lot closer together right yeah definitely yeah so that's cool do you so you guys
					speak in English a lot together because well yeah I speak English with Terror like uh I mean a lot
					of time in a day uh but I also combine all my languages so it's funny when you know we laugh like
					whenever she doesn't understand when I'm speaking French or Portuguese I was like oh what I'm saying
					is this so I I try to tell her in English but I mean she loves that environment that whenever once
					we can just speak different languages all of a sudden and we're just gonna have fun we're just gonna
					try to you know joke around and but yeah we mainly speak in English because that's that's her target
					language excellent man that's that's great I hope you guys can both work on your goals together and
					grow together and be very happy uh so now that we're on the topic of relationships okay I was going
					to save this question for a little bit later but we're talking about your relationship so I'm gonna
					ask you maybe this is almost even a philosophy question but it's it's very deep okay what does it
					mean to love somebody either that was coming because I watch I watch your the other interviews and
					you asked that to to your subscribers oh and you know when I hear that question when you ask that
					question to the Mexican girl I was like wow that's a very deep and nice question so what does it
					mean to love someone um okay so first uh you have to have clear what is love to you you know because
					I'm gonna tell you uh the definition of love for me right so I think love is a really powerful
					emotion but it's really important in human life and that love it's just a it is a connection that
					you generate with people but not only with people with the world itself but if we're talking about
					specifically romantic relationships is a connection that you can generate with a certain person
					where you can just feel really comfortable you can trust that person and that you know that it
					doesn't matter what happened in the future that you are gonna be there always so when you love
					someone you are just sharing a part of your life and because you don't want to you know you don't
					want to be just like oh I'm very arrogant and I just love myself and I don't need anybody else you
					know so I don't believe in that I believe that you have to have a first a great self-esteem that's
					very important in order to find a cute person because well if you don't have a self-esteem you're
					gonna find a lot of bad people on the way that's not available so in my case I really worked hard on
					myself to knowledge a lot of conversations just to have a balance in my life so I can decide oh okay
					I'm gonna look for a lot now because I'm ready you know so I did that and uh I feel that well I'm a
					nice person I consider that I've been working a lot of myself and uh now I can just look for
					somebody else that shares a lot of things in common with me and that I feel really comfortable with
					um so I just feel like well who are individuals but love just makes makes us like share a life
					together and I'm not your possession you are not my position we're just great people together
					sharing our time because that's what we want to do so yeah I mean that that's a complex question man
					but that's uh you know sort of an answer that I can give you right now all right my man I'm gonna
					have to put advanced in the title of this video This is Gonna Be Miguel avanzado wow but that great
					answer and that right there is a language learning goal anybody watching to be able to express
					yourself like that about a topic so deep as love very well done my friend very well done and I I
					agree 100 percent before you go looking for love you have to be complete you have to be a whole
					person yourself and if you don't think like you said it's not about uh being conceited or arrogant
					but if you don't think that you are good and you deserve good things you'll never find a good person
					to be with you and want to share that time yeah so that's very very cool very awesome uh I I like
					hearing your answer about that so let's see so you're from Colombia what what city do you live in uh
					I'm from antioche it's it's a department uh I was more important room for antiochia uh but now I'm
					living in manyzales okay all right so what is what is your favorite thing about your country about
					where you live people culture people are stock friendly it's something I really love because I well
					personally I talk to a lot of foreign people because that's what I do almost every day and and I'm
					curious about getting to know the culture of somebody else so that's why I spend some time on
					reading and also watch some conferences about it uh so I would say that Colombian culture it's so
					great because people are so friendly people are so warm so whenever you just you know you're just
					walking down the street and you feel kind of lost you can feel free to ask hey uh where's the
					nearest place or where's the bathroom or you know something like that when you're lost and people
					people gladly will answer you and uh it's very different when I'm when I'm talking when I talk to
					people from different countries uh because of their culture they're a little bit cold and well to be
					honest I don't like that because I'm a Colombian boy and I'm not cool at all so I just like to be a
					really extroverted even though in the past I was so introverted man that that was a big change that
					I did in my life uh but yeah and also I love nature Colombian nature oh man there is a lot of great
					places you know and talking about you know special natural places I love it I'm a natural lobber I
					take photos as well um I've done that so I would say culture and uh people itself culture that's
					natural places Okay cool so I want to ask you one question you you mentioned that you were very
					introverted when you were younger uh I'm gonna share a little bit of my experience and see if you
					can okay so when I was going to school high school growing up I was a very quiet child I didn't I
					had a couple friends not a lot I didn't speak up in class you know I just wanted to be under the
					radar and uh you know do my own thing and not have anybody bother me but after I started learning
					Spanish and practicing speaking with so many people from around the world I really came out of my
					shell as they say and uh became a lot more extroverted do you think languages were a part of that
					transformation in you as well you just hit the nail on the head man yeah I thought that was the
					that's why I just become became so extroverted because of the languages and yeah I can relate myself
					with your experience because it happened to me the same I was just like well I'm not focused on I'm
					speaking I'm just gonna finish my homework and that's all I'm just I was that the man you know back
					in the corner just just you know I don't want to talk to anybody else uh but yeah when I started
					learning English I realized that okay so what about if you know instead of talking to people here in
					Colombia uh what about protected for people because I well I don't know I am so I'm not gonna be shy
					of talking to him you know that's nice so I did it and that's funny because I talked to to more
					foreign people that even to my Colombian friends well and when I say that it just I I could feel
					like a big Improvement uh in my personality so talking about you know being extroverted so I was
					like wow I really love this I like this I like the fact that you know languages uh do you make me it
					was like yeah so and after that I started being more extroverted with my Colombian friends but
					that's how it happened you know English open open a lot of doors just to to get in touch with people
					and develop this kind of skill social skill so yeah oh okay very very cool that we share that
					experience um when I when I started learning Spanish I I started to feel so much more confident
					speaking with people even in English because if I could have an awesome conversation in my second
					language with somebody on the other side of the world why can't I talk to somebody in English and
					you know be myself be open be confident and also when you you start speaking to people from these
					other parts of the world you start to learn about the world you start to learn about other cultures
					and you I I want to say inevitably I I feel like we're getting super Advanced with the vocabulary
					and stuff but inevitably become uh much more interesting and complete person I think yeah does that
					mean when you talk to different people uh you are more open-minded because you try to be empathy
					with people and then try to understand it and you learn to not judge people because of their cover
					you know because you just seem like oh that's uh that's a bad word kid person well I wouldn't say
					that that's the right way to go about things so when you do it when you get surround yourself with
					people from different countries from different cultures uh they have different beliefs they have
					different religions you kind of learn how to be neutral and you know despite that you have your own
					religion your own beliefs you learn how to respect other people beliefs and how they think and you
					try to understand them better so you become really open-minded and then you see the world just like
					okay I'm not only from Colombia I'm from the whole world that's how I see you now absolutely I feel
					as though I'm a student of the world a student of life as well and you know one thing I've I've
					learned and really observed from religion or not religion from languages uh and really French kind
					of opened the door to this as well because with French I've spoken to a lot of people from Africa
					I've spoken to a lot of Muslims from uh the Middle East you know a lot of people from Morocco and uh
					like places like that who are Muslims and Arabs uh I've learned that yeah we all have big
					differences but people are really people you know we have the same problems we all you know we we
					all want human connection we have friends and families we have problems with our friends and
					families so I think there's more things in common than there are differences between human beings
					really yeah exactly because I mean it's about levels you know um when you say like oh I'm from X
					Country and this is my culture well I don't like to to identify myself with oh you're Colombia well
					yes I know I'm cologne because I was born there but I'm I don't like fanatism you know I hate that
					to be honest so I just like to be open it's like oh so for example if somebody else tell me like
					aren't you gonna help me because I'm I'm from this conscious life what are you talking about I mean
					you're a human being and I'm a human being so I don't care where you're from I just care uh you know
					kind of person you are so yeah that's that's very you know nice to to tackle things and just you
					know go up with the flow of it learn how to be a better human being exactly exactly so what you like
					about Colombia is uh beautiful nature I'll warm sure you guys are very close you can be open with
					one another what is something that you do not like about Colombia um okay is this could be a little
					bit tricky because you know um Colombia and it's it's very well known because of drugs um and I
					don't really like the image that people have from Colombia in foreign countries um I know that no
					country is perfect I know that um but yeah I mean Colombia uh the security per se it's a little bit
					crazy you know just you're just walking on the street at night you better be careful you know just
					just to to know where you're just walking because it can happen things um how people say Colombia
					because you know I talked to to many people around the world and when I say that I'm from Colombia
					immediately dated drugs I was like man man this is not that is not true well so don't don't close
					your mind just only on the continent you watch me news because most of the news are fake and that's
					how it works so don't guide yourself because of news or newspapers and all this kind of stuff if
					you've never been to Colombia before so it's like you know they're saying in English like don't
					judge a book by each cover you're gonna go for it and you gotta visit Colombia to realize how it is
					truly so I don't like the the image that people have from Colombia yeah yeah everybody wants to make
					Pablo Escobar jokes you know yeah yeah I don't like that so many kind warm amazing Colombians so
					yeah I I obviously don't don't judge you guys like that and I I can't wait to one day visit Colombia
					so when I do visit Columbia one day what do you recommend that I do first where should I go what
					should I see well it depends I mean what do you like to do when you travel first in another country
					okay so you you said there's beautiful nature there if I want to see the most beautiful part of
					Colombia what would you recommend wow man um okay so these are this is very famous places in
					Colombia yeah actually cities uh I don't know if you ever hear about uh Cartagena in Santa Barbara
					uh they're very beautiful to be honest I've traveled there once because I I don't travel a lot uh
					and man I mean you can see like a lot of beautiful paradise is there it's so so beautiful it's so
					wonderful so if you ever travel to Colombia I would recommend you go to Cartagena Santa Marta and
					also hmm there is a place there's actually a river it's like the river of seven colors and we have
					it in Colombia yeah right now I don't ever recall where is it exactly but it's if I'm not run it's
					an antiochia well I have I have to look for it as well uh but yeah that's what it is the river of
					seven colors man go for it that's so beautiful I've never personally I've never been to there but
					I've watched them like through videos and people telling their experiences there and it is so damn
					beautiful yeah to be honest okay very cool man I just wrote that down because I gotta check that out
					later yeah some videos of that for sure all right let's see so what is something that makes you very
					happy it could be something small for me a good good coffee makes my day a little better you know
					what yeah you're right about my mind because I'm a coffee lobber yeah I love coffee and well I was
					living alone before uh like four months ago I was living Milan I lived a lot for two years and every
					single day I would drink uh three to four cup of coffee cups of coffee every single day yeah I mean
					that is so cool I just love it because I also practice uh a lot of sports I do Sports and it helps
					me a lot to just you know get on it it's like oh okay let's do it and that's like a reward after
					exercising just you know being there very chill very relaxed and and also when you're reading a book
					you just lighter just drinking coffee you're learning you're acquiring new knowledge and yeah I mean
					I love that I love coffee okay excellent yeah it's just a moment of peace in your day you know like
					you said okay so you said reading a book do you read often yeah every day I did yeah I started you
					know learning well reading books since I was uh 14 uh when I had access to Internet because it was
					kind of hard to to have physical books and and also it was really limited because well I could go to
					the library but no topics that I really like so when I got internet I was like oh this is this is
					all this is all that I need to be a better human being because you know Internet it's it's a
					powerful tool but you have to use it wisely because otherwise it's gonna backfire your your you know
					your willingness to learn something great but at the end you just finished like learning you know
					crazy stuff there um so I really focus on using internet wisely and I started reading since I was
					13. I started reading about science uh because I also did some experiments like Michael Faraday uh
					like Tesla and I follow all these great scientists and I try to follow their steps and and also try
					to to create this kind of experiments at home and well that was kind of cool for me um so yeah since
					that time I I kept I kept reading out I mean until now okay very cool do you have a favorite book
					hmm oh this that's a hard question um I wouldn't say you have a favorite book I would say that I
					love many books because I don't want to to just separate this book from the other ones now I just
					love I've read a lot of wonderful books but one specially that I'm currently written and it's so so
					good that I would say I would buy this book and I would take it with me anywhere uh the title it's
					uh living as a stoic okay uh it's like 30 yeah 366 at quotes and that they give live from Marcus
					Aurelius and epictators and those kind of philosophers uh that they would upright their thoughts
					about something and then you can learn from that ancient knowledge so yeah I love that because it's
					very easy to digest and very easy to comprehend okay uh I'm writing down right now Marcus Aurelius
					because you reminded me that I have his book uh Reflections I believe it's called in English uh yes
					yes it's good it's a good book and I I think maybe I'll make a video about that soon uh today at 4
					30 I'll be making I have a video made already about this is Mr salus's book Mr salisbrook yeah so uh
					I have a video coming out today talking about that pretty interesting stuff he he knows his stuff
					when it comes to language learning that's for sure okay so we we discussed something that makes you
					happy a good cup of coffee that that relaxation and enjoying it what's something that makes you
					angry yeah well it's it's how I am that it's well my values as a human being you know that I
					followed it's for example commitment and punctuality so whenever I have a meeting with somebody else
					you better break punctual because I really care about it you know so that's why I got right into it
					when you sent me the link because I was like yeah yeah I mean because that for me it's it's a way
					it's it's a way of respect so if you if you attend a meeting on time you'll show me that you respect
					me so whenever I just you know try to get in touch with friends and some people and they don't get
					on they don't they are not on time it's like come on man if you're not here in 10 minutes I'm done
					I'm gone and actually I apply the same for my classes I tell my students well time it's really
					important for me because well it's valuable it's called so if you don't show up on time at least
					well I'm gonna give you a chance of showing up at least 10 minutes late but if you don't do it
					reschedule class so that is probably something that I'm not actually Technologies uh the controller
					incumbent because if you say oh I want to do this but you don't do it because you didn't want to or
					you forgot it oh man that's what am I doing you know what are we doing so yeah I would say that
					that's that's very important for me okay yeah I I agree because and I'm sure you feel the same way
					my time is very valuable they say time is money but it's even more than that time is knowledge time
					is power time is everything so if you waste my time that's like spitting on me you know that's so
					yeah completely man very very good okay all right now this one's good because I I want to hear you
					express yourself on this one I like this question what is what is your biggest fear I think all
					right so yeah so my biggest fear it's not to grow every day as a human being and just just being
					stuck so that that's my biggest fear just you know not growing as a human being not trying to be
					better not trying to be better or because I know a lot of people that they give up you know they
					give up in life and it's like oh no I'm lazy I don't want to improve I don't want to do this I don't
					want to do that uh to be honest I feel myself as a lot like a plant you know I have to water the
					plant every single day just to be better step by step and that's why I follow also a philosophy
					called Kaizen you know Japanese uh philosophy and it's about improving one percent every single day
					so when you do it at the end of the year it's even more than 300 percent you know you're a better
					human being so yeah I think that that's my biggest fear just to feel start to to lose hope in life
					just to to not want to learn oh man I mean if that happens one day it's because I am not Oscar
					because I it does for me just very important to keep right to our every single day in every aspect
					of your life not only knowledge or being you know wiser now you have to grow uh emotional
					intelligence um you have to work on your social skills also your relationships that are very
					important especially a family connection um and that that's true I mean when you have all these
					things uh like hover you feel really good but talking about financially your relationships emotional
					intelligence uh future plans I like to be very organized so when I was younger I I would just write
					like a like a journey per se and I would just copy it write down all the all of my goals and all the
					specific steps to follow in order to get it to achieve that um so yeah well I think that that's all
					that I can say yeah okay yeah all right yeah I could relate to that for sure and uh so I assume you
					have a list of goals right of course okay yeah that is so important and so many people do not have a
					goal written down and I do not understand how they live their lives this way I've tried to tell
					friends like you have to write down your goals all the successful people in this world know what
					they want they know how they're gonna get it and they work on it every day so if you're not willing
					to write down your goals you'll never achieve anything facts yeah and you know this is actually very
					interesting because one of one of the well this is my main goal and it's related to languages uh I
					want to speak at least 10 languages fluently and I'm on my way so right now I'm just I'm just
					tackling French and I know that you speak you speak French better tell me but well because I heard
					you you were not you were not you're an idiot you weren't there being a polyglot and he spoke
					several languages uh French was one of them and I heard your friends well you have a very good
					understanding uh you could speak even way better than me because I'm a beginner I started learning
					French uh three months ago I understand a lot but you know speaking it's it develops through time
					and actually your Spanish it's also really good when I hear your Spanish uh from the beginning I was
					like you can have a a great fluency with your Spanish uh your pronunciation it's on point it's very
					easy to understand your ideas so yeah I admire you how you manage to learn Spanish that way thank
					you I appreciate that yeah my Spanish is a lot better than my French and you know I've been putting
					so much time into the YouTube lately that I haven't had a whole lot of time to practice my French so
					uh my French has a little a little rusty right now but I I do I love the language I think it's
					beautiful but something I found a little bit difficult with French is the the lack of content you
					know uh for example if if you watched a show on Netflix for for example a Colombian show or Mexican
					show there's a hundred episodes in a season almost you know so that's so much time and input but in
					French shows there's like six or seven episodes each season I found yeah I'm talking about shows
					yeah you're right but it also depends on what really interested you because in my case I found a lot
					of YouTube channels uh they talk about universe and Science and French I'm I'm on it all day every
					single day it's like okay so today we're gonna learn about how the solar system works or how the the
					James Webb Telescope is gone you know so I'm just I'm just on it and I love it I mean despite that I
					don't understand everything I understand most of it and I have fun and this is like real natural
					exposure into the language so you know actually comprehensible input but that's that's all for me as
					well that doesn't tell my parents well if you really want to learn a language you just you have to
					use compressible input okay what's that well you have to choose you know uh your favorite topic but
					instead of starting your favorite Topic in your mediton just chat into your target language that's
					all you that you can do it man just just try to create up like a like a fictional environment of
					your target language at home it is possible exactly that that's that's how I learn Spanish that's
					how I learn French that's the way cool all right so what is an important lesson that you have
					learned in your life from a difficult situation or a difficult time okay so actually right now I'm
					in a very difficult situation but what I learned is that to become uh just to to face hard
					situations in life well because life is like a roller coaster you know up and down all the time and
					uh from my point of view what you need to do is that you need to be quiet you need to be calm you
					you kind of have to accept that live I mean it is what it is in the it's very uh temporary um and I
					don't know just just you know that calmness just like I was like okay so I'm getting through a very
					hard situation right now but now I just have to think what can I do you know instead of focusing on
					the problem focus on their Solutions that's one thing and also just to I mean even if you have
					problems in real life everybody has problems you have to learn how to live peacefully don't be worry
					all the time don't tell me like oh I lost my job I don't have money to buy this or well I don't know
					if I'm gonna you know buy food tomorrow it's hard yeah but at the same time you're gonna have to
					learn how to go with the flow how to live well despite all the situations that you know maybe
					they're hard for you so yeah I'm just like very chill I'm chill I'm just looking for the solutions I
					I just whenever a hard situation comes or came up I'm just like okay I'm gonna use word so I'm gonna
					just throw all my ideas and when I let my ideas out and I'm just gonna plan what can I do to solve
					it and well that's why I feel really chill despite of having a bunch of problems behind me um but
					yeah I would say that okay great yeah you you have to be calm in the middle of the storm no matter
					what's going on around you and I I guess you've learned a lot of that from stoicism how old did you
					say you were I'm 19. 19.
					oh man wow I was not this wise when I was 19 man that's so great that you uh you're you're searching
					for this wisdom and this knowledge from a young age you know when you're you're an older man when
					you're in your 30s and older you're gonna have such a a head start and an advantage on a lot of
					people who did not start learning these valuable lessons early yeah yeah thank you and I'm and I'm
					really hoping for that just to to be a a better human being every day and I don't know maybe when
					I'm 40 how would I be nicer you know just better you're gonna be better for sure and you'll probably
					be speaking in a lot of languages I imagine oh yeah absolutely yeah hope so so what does it mean for
					you to be successful what what will you want in your life before consider yourself to be a
					successful man Okay so um a man uh can be successful when he's the owner of his own mind that's all
					because well that doesn't matter how much money you have how much friends you have but at the end of
					the day if you don't understand yourself you're not if you're not really connected with yourself and
					if you're just sad all the time well it's a waste of time to be honest so I would say that you have
					to be the the owner of your mind you have to be the owner you just have to you know learn how to use
					like how to use it well properly and uh just so when you have this working for you because you know
					most of the time and yesterday actually I was reading uh a document about uh how many thoughts do we
					have every single day and researchers said that it was about uh 60 000 thoughts every single day and
					you know what five percent conscious thoughts it's five percent to be conscious oh my goodness so
					you don't have to really look after about five percent and make it yours just to have a better life
					because if you have this right well you see that the world for that very nice perspective and you
					don't have a problem so that that is success for me now I've been working on excellent man that's
					great do you know who Earl Nightingale is have you heard of him uh was that again Earl Nightingale
					have you heard of this man I have no idea okay later I'll write his name and send it to you I really
					recommend that you listen to him okay oh well thank you thank you so much really appreciate it yeah
					absolutely yeah he is uh he's dead now he he was uh he was popular in the the 50s and the 60s but he
					said that a man is successful when he knows where he's going and he knows what he's doing he knows
					what he wants basically it can be summed up like you said when a man is the owner of his own mind
					he's successful and uh yeah I think you you might really enjoy listening to his content pure wisdom
					pure wisdom oh wow that's cool for me yeah so I'll I'll uh I'll send you that later because uh it's
					kind of a weird name so I'll type that out for you later first time I heard about it so we talked
					about success you you say it's about controlling your mind and I agree that that's the start once
					you control your mind it's all done the battle's over you won now it's about creating your life
					getting what you want so so we're talking about that what do you think about money what what's your
					money philosophy is it important is it not that important is it good is it bad what do you think
					about money a very controversial topic um money uh believe it or not it's very important nowadays
					because of the economy because of the system how the system works so we have to have money if we
					want to live well but here's the thing here's the matter you have to know because money can become a
					great thing in your life or can become the worst thing in your life uh so what it depends on well
					basically it depends on how much money do you think that making you know monthly you can live well
					and peacefully so what is that number for you it could be I don't know uh ten thousand dollars fifty
					thousand dollars well everybody has a different number because this is this is you know measured
					like like a thermometer some people because because their family is Rich so they might say well two
					hundred thousand dollars a month but some people would say just ten thousand it's good for me it
					works it's not because once you when you don't have that measure right uh you can become like a
					crazy person just looking for money and you're gonna get lies in that and that's that's gonna waste
					your life because money is not everything money it's a really powerful tool yeah absolutely and you
					just have to understand money just as a tool not not as everything else so I don't know money is
					just like like a glass of water you use it to drink water that's all money uh helps you to cover
					your basic needs so that's the that's the first part that you need to reach cover your base needs
					and after that just have a Just Have Your Mother well just like okay I think that if I have this
					money I can live without any problem I'm not gonna look for money because money is not gonna be
					important for me anymore because I'm just making this exact number of money and when you don't think
					about money you can think about better and more important stuff in your life you know so you just
					have to bridge that in my case I want to be uh I want to reach the Financial Freedom you know I want
					to invest my money I want to create a lot of uh incomes um but yeah I mean it's it's important topic
					for me just to to cover my needs but money it's it's not the most important thing in my life because
					it's just a tool for me the most important thing is to control my mind and our success my age is a
					secondary thing in your life but yeah it is important nowadays okay yeah exactly I I think about
					money very often but I don't obsess over it the reason that I want money why I try to learn so much
					about money why I try so many different ways to generate income is because I want the freedom like
					you said I want the freedom that money can give me I want to have money so that I don't have to
					think about money ever again and just imagine if you don't have to think about how am I going to
					earn my money this month what you could do with that mind that you're the owner of you know you can
					start to put that mind to use to solve so many more problems and help so many more people you know
					if if I didn't have my job where I work 12 hours you know imagine how much more content I can make
					imagine how many more people we could reach how much more good we could do in the world so yeah I
					money is very important to me but it's because I'm searching for that freedom and I think having
					enough like you said to meet your needs makes you a better person not that money makes you better
					but having that freedom and that peace and not the stress that does make you a better and more
					generous person exactly okay great let me see what is something that you have never done that you
					would like to do in your future a new experience well what would you like to do the thing that you
					are very interested in trying uh travel around the world because I you know honestly I've never been
					to I never been overseas before um and languages are a tool that you know allows me to they allow me
					to just get in touch with people easily and also I believe I truly believe that in order to to have
					a deeper connection with with local people you have to speak their language so that's one of the
					main reasons why I'm learning a couple a bunch of languages just just because I want to be able to
					to talk to a local without a problem and and connect with their language and just try to understand
					in a way that it's not possible using my mother tongue so yeah while I'm traveling I love to do it
					just use all my languages while traveling okay cool yeah like you said I mean look at this
					conversation uh look at how you've been able to express yourself with a native speaker you know
					we've talked about some some deep ideas and uh imagine had you never learned English we would not be
					able to connect in this way so very very cool all right so I know you've you've got a lot of goals
					do you have a big dream for your future where do you want your life to be as you grow where do you
					see your life going okay somehow I want to I want to run my own business related to languages and uh
					I see myself work remotely from anywhere I don't like Siri to you know to be attached to to a job
					where I just have to go physical angels to be in an office I don't like it so I would like to have
					my own business and at the same time traveling and I see myself you know with my own family I mean
					at least with my girlfriend just just traveling being together and it doesn't matter but well maybe
					we're gonna have just in a couple of houses in several countries because we're going to be traveling
					um but I just want to be free I just want this freedom of you know uh I just want to do many things
					and I just want to feel free to work from anywhere and at the same time helping people with all the
					knowledge that I can upward you know to this Humanity just because that's what I think you know
					because that the more you help the better it feel and the better you understand that if we are here
					if we are human beings I mean we're here just to help each other not to be selfish or arrogant or
					well that's how you see the world the whole Health Earth planet it's it's my home and the fact that
					I study science I feel really small when I see you know all of these cosmas when I see the galaxies
					it's like man you know look at that later tiny uh I don't know atom atom in the in the cosmos it's
					not in it in that nothing you feel arrogant you feel the best I don't think so so yeah that's you
					know a little bit of my thoughts now I have one one other question one last question for you since
					you're you're into science and the universe uh this is a a strange question sometimes do you believe
					that there is other life in the universe good question um Okay so look at this uh they are
					Jennifer's it's so big that not even I mean nobody knows how big is it because all the time is
					expanding itself well Earth it's little it's very little it's it's small it's nothing in this whole
					Cosmos in this whole Space solid if if there was only live on earth it would be such a waste of time
					of the space I mean I don't know aliens I don't know life beyond but I just don't like oh I I don't
					deny the possibility that there is life beyond other planets and other galaxies because air that's
					nothing there's many galaxies out there so what makes you think that you're the only one alive um
					that's what I think okay it's a it's a very cool question I think and a good thought exercise I've
					thought about it much myself and I I enjoy the topics like that all right my friend those were all
					the questions I have for you today is there anything you would like to ask me uh well actually I'm
					very curious like well what do you do you said that you work 12 hours so I work for a steel company
					uh one of the real companies in America and it pays okay you know there's good benefits for my son
					and stuff but the best thing about my job is that I have some free time there so for example if I'm
					working 12 hours sometimes I might have one hour sometimes I might have two hours free at my job and
					I'll use that time to read to become more intelligent to learn my languages so there's pros and cons
					with it uh uh like you I would like to move into my own business and generated a very healthy income
					with my languages and what I enjoy doing that's the goal that's where I'm going and why I do all
					this extra because right now it's like I have at least two jobs you know I uh I do full-time the
					YouTube three videos each week I do these conversations that's a lot of work editing uh recording
					and then I'm also a single father my son lives with me so I'm trying to juggle a lot of things right
					now but I like you said I'm trying to be calm in the storm and control this and I know that I'll end
					up in a good place oh wow well I really wish you the best man because you deserve it well you know
					it's being a single father I mean imagine it's not easy it's hard well I personally I don't have any
					kids but I just imagine life how hard it would be oh so you know there's actually something funny
					that I was I was watching uh your last video before this meeting and then you were in the forest
					with this camera person whatever because uh when she left her laughter was really contagious it was
					like well I didn't see her but it was so funny and it was uh you know when it started like oh I
					don't know what to ask you so she's gonna ask me like a couple of questions and then you were just
					walking it's like okay that's what kind of questions and and I I could tell that she's learning
					English with you that's amazing man um that was so funny you know I like the way that you upload
					this kind of videos it feels like more natural more human it's not everything prepared per se yeah
					man that's that's so cool that's so amazing and I'm really glad that uh you're having success with
					your YouTube channel and uh as I told you before I'm Gonna Keep promoting your channel because I
					think it's it's a really powerful tool that you can use in your bandage just to keep on learning
					your you know target language English um so Martin asks you a lot of questions I just want to thank
					you for that great job and it just it's an inspiration for a lot of people and honestly I just
					wanted to to have this meeting with you just to to be an inspiration as well to to your subscribers
					that I mean if you want to learn a language you can do it it is possible so uh the only barrier that
					maybe you have it's your own mind remember that and with your help with all your videos with your
					wisdom with all your advices it's it's so wonderful just to be on YouTube and fight and find a very
					safe and nice space where you can just have family learning so yeah really thank you so much and I'm
					gonna keep using your videos as an example to teach my students excellent thank you so much for that
