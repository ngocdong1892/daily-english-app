					Hello, and welcome to Agile Project
					Management.<br />So far, this program has covered the foundations of project management and what it
					takes to be a project manager.<br />We’ve explored the phases of the project lifecycle– initiation,
					planning, execution, and closing.<br />And we’ve reviewed lots of different tools and techniques for
					managing and communicating your plans.<br />We’ve also discussed how to handle various challenges,
					risks, and issues that come up along the way.<br />If you’ve completed all the courses so far,
					congratulations.<br />If you’re just now joining, welcome.<br />Either way, you’re on your way to a
					new
					or maybe just improved career in project management.<br />Now that you have a solid foundation on
					what
					it takes to manage a project, I’m going to share with you one of the most popular approaches to
					delivering projects, Agile.<br />In my opinion, Agile is also the most interesting and flexible
					approach
					to project management.<br />Agile is not a project management methodology in and of itself but more
					of
					an overarching approach and philosophy to deliver value to customers, which is the goal of most
					projects.<br />Despite not being a specific methodology, there are lots of frameworks and methods
					under
					the Agile umbrella.<br />In this course, I’ll help prepare you for a career in Agile project
					management.<br />I’ll provide you with a history of Agile and introduce you to a specific Agile
					delivery
					framework called Scrum.<br />I’ll teach you about the core roles that make up a Scrum team.<br />And
					finally, I’ll cover some best practices and real-world scenarios where you can use the Agile
					approach to
					lead your project to success.<br />Oh, and I should probably introduce myself.<br />My name is Sue,
					and
					I’m a senior technical program manager with Google Support platform.<br />We build the products you
					use
					to get user support from nearly all of Google’s products.<br />I started at Google in 2014 and
					worked on
					product reliability, making sure Google’s products are up and running all the time for billions of
					people across the world who depend on them.<br />Before Google, I worked at many companies of
					different
					types and sizes, where I ran and worked on projects using Waterfall, Agile, and everything in
					between.<br />I started my career as a software engineer working on cell phone technology, but I
					didn’t
					have a degree in computer science.<br />Since then, I’ve had many different roles, but program
					management is my passion because it brings all of the disciplines together to deliver amazing
					outcomes
					for the customers and equally amazing results for the business.<br />I still remember the aha moment
					I
					had when I discovered Agile, and I’m excited to share it with you.<br />I hope you’re ready to
					discover
					Agile and experience your own aha moment.<br />In the next video, we’ll start learning the basics of
					Agile.<br />Meet you there.<br />[MUSIC PLAYING] To quickly review, Waterfall is a popular project
					management methodology that refers to the sequential or linear ordering of phases.<br />You complete
					one
					phase at a time, not proceeding to the next until it is done.<br />Then you move down the line like
					a
					waterfall starting at the top of a mountain and traveling to the bottom.<br />The term “agile”
					refers to
					being able to move quickly and easily.<br />It also refers to flexibility and the willingness and
					ability to change and adapt.<br />Projects that adopt Agile Project Management take an iterative
					approach, which means the project processes are repeated, often many times during the lifecycle of
					the
					project.<br />In this case, the team operates within many shorter blocks of time called
					iterations.<br />Individual iterations might get repeated, depending on the feedback
					received.<br />During each iteration, the team takes a subset of all the project’s activities and
					does
					all the work required to complete that subset of activities.<br />You can think of it as a lot of
					mini
					waterfalls for each activity.<br />This iterative approach enables the project to move quickly, as
					well
					as making it much more adaptive to change.<br />So the term “agile” means flexibility, repetition,
					and
					openness to change.<br />But what do we mean by Agile Project Management?<br />Agile Project
					Management
					is an approach to project and team management based on the Agile Manifesto.<br />The Manifesto is a
					collection of four values and 12 principles that define the mindset that all agile teams should
					strive
					for.<br />So in very basic terms, Waterfall is linear and sequential and does not encourage changing
					up
					the process once it has started.<br />Agile, on the other hand, is iterative, flexible, and
					incorporates
					necessary changes throughout the process.<br />Now, a bit of a history lesson so you can have a
					better
					sense of how and why Agile has become such a popular approach to project management.<br />Agile
					methodologies emerged organically during the 1990s as the software industry was
					booming.<br />Software
					startups like Google were blazing a trail to get more software products built in less
					time.<br />Meanwhile, the tech giants of the time were experimenting with faster ways to build
					better
					software and stay competitive.<br />And by the way, software isn’t just the apps and websites that
					we
					all use every day.<br />Software also includes the code behind innovations in agriculture, medical
					devices, manufacturing, and more.<br />So in this competitive, growing environment, companies
					couldn’t
					just create new innovative products.<br />They also needed to innervate the very processes they were
					using to develop those new products.<br />In 2001, the thought leaders and creators of some of these
					new
					processes, also called methodologies, came together to find common ground between their methods and
					solve a problem.<br />The problem, they agreed, was that companies were so focused on planning and
					documenting their project that they lost sight of what really mattered, pleasing their
					customers.<br />So these leaders came up with the Agile Manifesto to guide others on what they
					believed
					really matters when developing software, which is keeping the process flexible and focusing on
					people,
					both the team and the users, over the end products or deliverables.<br />Now, here’s where Agile
					gets
					even more interesting.<br />You can still use Agile even if you’re not planning to work on software
					projects.<br />Agile has been so successful in the software industry that its values, principles,
					and
					frameworks have been applied to nearly every industry.<br />In fact, the Agile methods that you’re
					going
					to learn also draw heavily on lean manufacturing principles that originated in Toyota’s car
					factories in
					the 1930s.<br />You’ll also find Agile methods being adopted in the aeronautical, health care,
					education, finance industries, and even more.<br />Cool, right?<br />Agile is
					everywhere.<br />[MUSIC
					PLAYING] Agile was created in response to the strict, linear process of Waterfall.<br />While
					Waterfall
					aims for predictability and tries to avoid change, Agile embraces the reality that the world,
					markets,
					and users are uncertain and unpredictable.<br />For example, your customer might say they want
					feature
					A, but when the final result is delivered, they realize they actually wanted feature B. Agile aims
					to
					solve that problem by getting customer feedback more quickly to make sure that the team is building
					what
					the customer really wants.<br />Part of working with an Agile mindset is always seeking out ways to
					work
					more efficiently.<br />We do this by finding ways to streamline processes without reducing product
					quality or value.<br />The key to streamlining is to reduce waste.<br />For example, unnecessary
					documentation is a form of waste.<br />Another form of waste is spending weeks or months working on
					a
					feature only to find out that the customers, who could also be users or stakeholders, don’t like the
					feature after all.<br />You could reduce or eliminate both of these forms of waste by increasing
					team
					and stakeholder collaboration.<br />More collaboration means less documentation and earlier feedback
					about the product.<br />Let’s consider some more differences between Waterfall and Agile.<br />Three
					important aspects of a project are requirements, documentation, and deliverables.<br />Requirements
					are
					conditions that must be met or tasks that must be finished to ensure the successful completion of
					the
					project.<br />Think of these as the set of criteria that fall within the scope of your project or a
					list
					of specifications that must be met.<br />In a Waterfall project, you’ll probably need a product
					requirements document, which lists the scope and requirements of the project.<br />You need to have
					several formally approved project plans, and you might have a team of people whose job it is just to
					write and approve these plans.<br />You might also set up a change control board, a formal and
					rigorous
					process to manage any changes to requirements.<br />All this is designed to protect the team from
					building something that the client or stakeholders don’t want and aims to minimize any changes that
					could lead to scope creep.<br />Formally approved project plans work well when the desired end
					product
					is known and understood.<br />An example of this might be leading a project that has clear
					requirements
					and goals based on mandated regulation.<br />But if that’s not the case, a Waterfall team risks
					building
					out an entire deliverable only to find out later that the customer doesn’t like the final
					result.<br />In Agile, requirements are treated as more dynamic and expected to change as the team
					receives feedback and new information.<br />There is usually an initial set of requirements or
					feature
					ideas when the project kicks off.<br />But that list of requirements and features is continuously
					growing and changing throughout the project.<br />The team works with stakeholders to prioritize the
					requirements, always moving the most urgent or valuable items to the top of the list.<br />Then the
					team
					goes down the list, working on the requirements in iterations.<br />By going down the list, the team
					is
					able to get feedback on their work quickly and frequently.<br />At the end of each iteration, the
					team
					gets feedback and can make necessary adjustments to the requirements before continuing on.<br />OK,
					the
					second aspect is documentation.<br />All projects require documentation– project plans, stakeholder
					maps, schedules, charters, contracts.<br />The list goes on and on.<br />Waterfall projects use lots
					of
					documentation because there are lots of hand-offs between phases and hand-offs among different teams
					within the project.<br />Also, because the work is done in bigger chunks, you’ll need to leave
					behind
					more pieces of documentation at each stage in the project.<br />But in Agile, there’s an emphasis on
					real-time person-to-person conversations.<br />This doesn’t mean that there’s zero
					documentation.<br />It’s just in a different form.<br />Instead of big formal documents with a
					rigorous
					change management and approval process, there are shorter documents that have just enough detail to
					achieve their purpose.<br />These documents are much more focused on what the reader needs to know
					to
					get the job done and are written only as needed.<br />Finally, let’s explore deliverables.<br />A
					deliverable is a tangible outcome from a project.<br />In Waterfall projects, you often don’t
					release
					the deliverable until the very end.<br />The final product release feels like a big event, major
					announcement, lots of hoopla, and is often super fun and exciting.<br />Agile is just as exciting
					but
					has smaller, more frequent releases.<br />So each release has a less formal celebration, but it
					builds
					up to be just as exciting.<br />When there’s lots of uncertainty in a project, such as in a new,
					emerging industry or market, the steady release of project deliverables enables an Agile team to get
					feedback and learn as they go.<br />Without regular feedback, the team could end up delivering
					something
					that the customer doesn’t want.<br />So now you have a better idea of some key elements of Agile
					that
					distinguish it from Waterfall.<br />Three differences between these two project management
					approaches
					are the way each one deals with requirements, documentation, and deliverables.<br />[MUSIC PLAYING]
					Now
					that you’re more familiar with the history of Agile and how it’s applied to project management,
					let’s
					discuss the inspiration behind this Agile movement, the Agile Manifesto.<br />In this video, I’ll
					list
					the four values of Agile and describe how each Agile team needs to strike a balance between the four
					values.<br />Being familiar with the Agile Manifesto will help you understand the core principles
					and
					values of Agile Project Management so you can put them into practice on a project.<br />The Agile
					Manifesto was written in 2001 and brings together the collective wisdom of the people who developed
					it
					from their vast experience and thought leadership in the tech industry.<br />If you’d like to find
					the
					Manifesto, it’s easy.<br />Just type in agilemanifesto.org in your search browser.<br />We’ve made
					it
					available for you here in the course readings as well.<br />Let’s check it out.<br />The Manifesto
					for
					Agile software development states, “We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it
					and
					helping others do it.<br />Through this work, we have come to value individuals and interactions
					over
					processes and tools, working software over comprehensive documentation, customer collaboration over
					contract negotiation, responding to change over following a plan.<br />That is, while there is value
					in
					the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.” There you have it, the Agile Manifesto
					and
					the four values of Agile.<br />It’s a short list, but it packs a punch.<br />The Manifesto is saying
					that it’s helpful for every Agile team to think about both sides of each statement during the
					execution
					of a project but should find ways to ensure that they’re always placing more value and emphasis on
					the
					things on the left over the things on the right.<br />From the four values, a set of 12 principles
					were
					developed that reinforced the message of the Manifesto.<br />These values and principles inform the
					why,
					how, and what of Agile Project Management planning and processes.<br />Let’s take it from the
					top.<br />First, the Manifesto emphasizes individuals and interactions over processes and
					tools.<br />At
					its core, this value stresses people communicating with each other over using lots of processes and
					tools to force things to happen in a certain way.<br />For example, have you ever emailed someone
					with a
					question and ended up in a long back-and-forth exchange due to simple follow-up questions or
					clarifications?<br />Chances are that you could have gotten the same information in less time with a
					brief conversation.<br />Agile wants to ensure that teams work together, collaborate, and help each
					other achieve the best outcomes they can.<br />Agile also values individual perspectives and
					creativity.<br />This does not mean that every team is chaotic.<br />The value just means that
					processes
					and tools should be used to facilitate and drive good project management and improved collaboration
					within the team, and should never be used as a barrier to teams working well with each
					other.<br />The
					second value emphasizes working software over comprehensive documentation, meaning that teams should
					prioritize spending time working on things that actually create value and avoid spending any more
					time
					than they really need on debating, writing, and reviewing documents.<br />Now, this value might seem
					like it only applies to software projects.<br />But just replace the term working software with
					whatever
					your project is trying to deliver.<br />Maybe the project is writing a legal brief, designing an
					office
					layout, or preparing a sales presentation.<br />Whatever your project is trying to deliver is the
					thing
					that creates value.<br />In other words, it’s more important to deliver the product the customer
					wants
					than to comprehensively document the process that you used.<br />Onto the third value, customer
					collaboration over contract negotiation.<br />In Agile projects, the customer satisfaction is
					considered
					the highest priority of building a high-quality and valuable product.<br />After all, if it’s not
					valuable to the customer, then there’s little point spending time on it.<br />When The Manifesto
					discusses contracts, it refers to the official documents that require sign off and formal agreement
					with
					the customer, such as those huge requirement documents or formal change requests.<br />Agile values
					having the freedom to collaborate with customers early and often.<br />In doing so, teams can
					quickly
					react and adapt to what customers need rather than waiting out the process of negotiating contract
					terms
					just to make a few changes or request resources.<br />There will still be contracts with Agile
					Project
					Management, but the focus is on identifying what’s really needed and leaving space for
					collaborative,
					customer-focused work.<br />Agile teams are encouraged to seek out every opportunity to include the
					customer or stakeholder during project execution.<br />This could be presenting early prototypes,
					asking
					questions, or bringing them in to do some initial drug testing.<br />And finally, we have the fourth
					value, responding to change over following a plan.<br />This last value is crucial to an Agile
					project.<br />As I explained in the history overview, agile grew out of a world that was changing so
					fast that organizations couldn’t adapt and struggle to survive.<br />As a result, this value
					stresses
					that every Agile team needs to acknowledge that change is inevitable.<br />The larger, longer, and
					more
					complex your project is, the more uncertainty there is.<br />For many projects, finalizing a
					well-established plan at the beginning of the project will likely lead to an on-time delivery within
					budget but may run the risk of not meeting customer needs or adding maximum value.<br />As a project
					manager, the key takeaway to remember here is that the most successful projects are the ones that
					are
					able to smoothly integrate change.<br />Agile project managers still create and value their plans,
					but
					they can cope with and are able to adapt if the plans need revising at any time during the
					project.<br />So there you have it, the four agile values– individuals and interactions over
					processes
					and tools, working software over comprehensive documentation, customer collaboration over contract
					negotiation, and responding to change over following a plan.<br />What’s great about Agile is that
					it
					gives us these values and also lets us find the right balance between the two sides.<br />You may
					have
					to fine tune your project style to meet industry needs, team dynamics, and organizational goals to
					find
					the healthy balance that works for you and your team.<br />[MUSIC PLAYING] For this course, I’ve
					grouped
					the 12 principles into four themes.<br />These are different from the four values.<br />The four
					themes
					of the Agile principles are value delivery, or how do Agile teams deliver highly valuable products
					to
					their customers; business collaboration, or how do Agile teams collaborate with their business
					partners
					and stakeholders to create business value to the organization and their users; team culture, or how
					does
					a team create and maintain the right interpersonal and team dynamics to deliver value for the
					customers
					and the business; and retrospectives, or how does the project learn to continuously increase
					performance
					of an organization in business.<br />As I said, I’ve grouped each of the 12 principles under these
					themes so they’re easier to learn and remember.<br />Let’s dive in.<br />The first theme is value
					delivery and includes five principles.<br />Take a few seconds to review them.<br />This theme is
					about
					delivering the work as quickly as possible.<br />And remember why?<br />So that we can get feedback
					and
					mitigate the risk that we spend too much time building the wrong thing.<br />Also, no one gets any
					value
					from your work, including your company, until you deliver it.<br />So the longer you take to
					deliver,
					the longer you wait to get revenue, and maybe the more time the competition has to get ahead of
					you.<br />These may look very software oriented.<br />But if you replace the word software with
					deliverables or solutions, these can apply to almost any project.<br />For example, deliver working
					solutions frequently.<br />See?<br />The value theme is also about simplicity.<br />How much time do
					you
					think it takes engineers to add all the buttons and features to products that ultimately end up
					confusing the user?<br />Simplicity allows a team to focus and work on the things that matter the
					most.<br />An example of this theme in action might be prioritizing getting feedback on a product
					prototype so you know which features really matter.<br />Or it might mean ensuring the team only
					works
					on approved features and doesn’t spend time on unnecessary ones.<br />Another example might be
					reserving
					10% of the team’s time to work on bug fixing or polishing a process, which should help you go faster
					in
					future iterations.<br />The next theme is business collaboration and includes two more
					principles.<br />Quick note– one of the principles uses the term business people to refer to those
					involved with things like sales, marketing, customer support, and account management.<br />We’ll use
					the
					term developers to refer to those who are involved with making and creating products.<br />OK, so we
					discussed customer collaboration during the values discussion.<br />And here we are
					again.<br />Collaborating with your customers helps the team get critical business information
					immediately, allowing them to adjust and adapt to any new information instantly.<br />No matter if
					it’s
					realized early or late in the project, customers will get what they want to achieve their business
					goals.<br />You could achieve collaboration by making sure that business people work near the
					development team, ideally in the same office or virtual space.<br />If that’s not possible, maybe
					co-locating a day a week, encouraging instant messaging, or blocking off time on your team calendars
					each day or week to collaborate.<br />The goal is to enable easy access between business people and
					developers.<br />Another example might be how you handle feedback and changes in
					priorities.<br />Rather
					than trying to keep the customer away from developers due to concerns about scope creep, create a
					weekly
					huddle where customers and business people can explore feedback and new ideas with the
					team.<br />This
					could be a great way to discover that one really valuable feature is super easy to build, whereas
					another feature of the user’s thought would be easy is actually really hard.<br />Our third theme is
					team dynamics and culture and includes four more principles.<br />Remember, the first Agile values
					stresses individuals and interactions over processes and tools.<br />Notice that the principles in
					this
					theme reflect that value.<br />This theme emphasizes creating an effective team culture that is
					inclusive, supportive, and empowering.<br />Having an effective team culture is essential to a
					project’s
					success.<br />These principles really boil down to making sure your team is motivated to do the
					right
					thing, feels trusted to do the right thing, has the resources and space to work closely together on
					their goals, and works at a sustainable pace.<br />An example of emphasizing effective team culture
					would be to ask the team what kind of equipment they need to do their job and then giving them those
					tools.<br />Another manifestation of this theme is letting teams write their own processes and
					templates
					rather than forcing them to use something from headquarters.<br />Teams work best when they feel
					like
					their input is valued.<br />So you as the project manager should make space for your team to engage
					and
					actively contribute to the team culture.<br />You’ll build trust and empower them to approach their
					work
					in a way that suits them best, which in turn will allow them to work more
					productively.<br />Finally,
					the fourth theme is retrospectives and continuous learning.<br />The last principle stands alone in
					this
					theme, so I’ll read it aloud.<br />“At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more
					effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.” This one sits on its own because I want
					to
					draw attention to how important it is for Agile teams to continuously learn and adapt to what’s
					working
					and what’s not working for them.<br />Teams should always be figuring out better ways to work, and
					it’s
					really valuable to set this time aside after each iteration to focus entirely on how to
					improve.<br />In
					these sessions, the team can step back and consider questions like, how is the team doing?<br />Are
					the
					customers happy?<br />Are there processes we could optimize?<br />Are our tools working for
					us?<br />Are
					we following the values?<br />Are we accumulating any debt?<br />And by debt, I mean processes or
					technology that slows us down.<br />We’ve officially finished discussing the Agile
					Manifesto.<br />It’s
					amazing to think that these four values and 12 principles are the foundations of so many advances in
					project management.<br />I’ll come back to these values and principles throughout the rest of this
					course to demonstrate how these connect to the day-to-day activities of an Agile
					project.<br />[MUSIC
					PLAYING] Every project exists within organizations and settings with different cultures, business
					objectives, and industry dynamics.<br />In this video, we’ll discuss some different scenarios in
					which
					you’d want to adopt an Agile mindset.<br />I’ll also introduce you to a concept called VUCA that can
					help you decide which management approach is best for your project.<br />Remember, Agile is about
					delivering value in a world with high degrees of uncertainty, risk, and competition.<br />It sets a
					team
					up to react as quickly as possible to new information, new market opportunities, and even new
					technologies.<br />Agile works best in industries or projects that are susceptible to or that
					encourage
					change and uncertainty.<br />What kinds of businesses or industries, besides software, come to mind
					that
					deal with lots of change?<br />A few that I think of are biotechnology, with emerging vaccines,
					treatments, and technologies; media, with endless new ways to share content; the food industry, with
					celebrity chefs and the latest food craze; and fashion, an industry built on keeping up with
					shifting
					trends.<br />Did any of these surprise you?<br />On the flip side, here are some industries that you
					might think of as fairly stable– agriculture, aerospace, manufacturing, and mining.<br />But even
					these
					industries with rigorous supply chains and codes have to adapt to change due to new laws and
					regulations, natural disasters, and other unforeseen issues.<br />One thing that the year 2020
					taught
					all of us is that no industry is truly immune to change and uncertainty.<br />We’re going to explore
					a
					concept for categorizing and thinking about these forces that shape our world, no matter what
					industry
					we’re in.<br />That concept is called VUCA, and it can help you decide which project management
					approach
					is best for you.<br />The US Military War College developed a concept called VUCA, spelled V-U-C-A.
					VUCA
					is an acronym that defines the conditions that affect organizations in a changing and complex
					world.<br />It was designed to help us factor in the forces of change and uncertainty in our
					projects
					and businesses.<br />VUCA stands for Volatility, Uncertainty, Complexity, and Ambiguity.<br />I’ll
					explain each one and what that could entail in projects and business settings.<br />First up is
					Volatility.<br />Volatility refers to the rate of change and churn in a business or
					situation.<br />In a
					volatile project, you would discuss how the next disruption to your operations is always right
					around
					the corner, or it feels like things never have time to settle into a normal rhythm.<br />Next is
					Uncertainty.<br />Uncertainty refers to the lack of predictability or high potential for
					surprise.<br />In an uncertain environment, it would be difficult to create plans for the future
					that
					were not based on a large number of assumptions that could turn out to be incorrect.<br />Then
					there’s
					Complexity.<br />Complexity refers to the high number of interrelated forces, issues, organizations,
					and
					factors that would influence the project.<br />For example, if one product being worked on relied on
					diverse and global suppliers, that would add to the complexity of the project.<br />And finally, we
					have
					Ambiguity.<br />Ambiguity refers to the possibility of misunderstanding the conditions and root
					causes
					of events or circumstances.<br />A project that suffered from ambiguity would have difficulty
					pinpointing the causes of project delays, making it difficult to design mitigation plans to reduce
					the
					risks.<br />Let’s recap.<br />VUCA stands for Volatility, Uncertainty, Complexity, and
					Ambiguity.<br />It’s a concept that was developed to deal with these forces in a changing and
					uncertain
					world.<br />Businesses can apply the concept of VUCA as a tool for determining how best to approach
					projects.<br />Phew.<br />That’s a lot of info, but it’s all good stuff.<br />Having an
					understanding of
					these concepts will help with decision making in all kinds of projects.<br />Adopting an Agile
					approach
					increases your chances of success despite this uncertainty.<br />And these concepts apply to the
					business world at large, not just projects.<br />[MUSIC PLAYING] Now let’s discuss why it’s
					important to
					understand VUCA as it relates to project management.<br />When we get started on a new project, it’s
					helpful to examine the environment and conditions in which the project exists before we decide the
					best
					approach to use.<br />If your project environment has high levels of volatility, uncertainty,
					complexity, and ambiguity, then it’s a good sign that you should consider an Agile
					approach.<br />While
					an agile approach is not a perfect solution that will get rid of VUCA, it will lead to better
					outcomes
					by giving you and your team tools and systems to mitigate the risks that VUCA presents.<br />When
					you
					consider Agile values and principles, it’s clear that Agile is a proven and well-documented solution
					to
					the challenges VUCA presents to your project.<br />OK, let’s revisit the Office Green scenario we
					introduced earlier in the program.<br />We’ll use this scenario throughout this course as well to
					illustrate the power of an Agile approach to project management.<br />If you’re just joining us now,
					I’ll give you a quick recap.<br />In previous courses, learners acted as the lead project manager at
					Office Green, LLC, a commercial landscaping company focused on interior plant design for offices,
					restaurants, and hotels.<br />For this Agile course, we’ll come back to Office Green as they pursue
					a
					new business opportunity.<br />The Office Green market research team noticed a major shift to more
					workers setting up and working from a home office.<br />They wanted to react fast to a potentially
					huge
					market opportunity and not lose revenue if businesses had less need for their previous office
					service.<br />Instead of offering indoor landscaping designs for businesses, Office Green wants to
					find
					a way to capture this new market full of home offices.<br />I don’t know about you all, but I have a
					hard time keeping plants alive.<br />I can’t keep a cactus alive.<br />But I love all those video
					conference backgrounds that are so nicely decorated with beautiful live plants.<br />This shift to
					working from home came about suddenly, so Office Green didn’t have any project plans to start
					from.<br />They didn’t have time to do a lot of prep work, but they wanted to maximize this
					opportunity
					before it was too late.<br />To do this, Office Green assigned you to be the project manager of a
					scrappy, new Agile team.<br />Your goal is to deliver their new service called Virtual
					Verde.<br />What
					environment did office green face?<br />Volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and
					ambiguity.<br />They
					experienced volatility in the form of a major disruptive change to their business plans; uncertainty
					through a lack of predictability, which made it difficult to create concrete plans for the future; a
					high level of complexity due to interrelated factors, like suppliers and the economy.<br />And they
					experienced ambiguity by not being able to determine or control what might cause future
					changes.<br />By
					using an Agile approach to their project, Office Green was able to address high VUCA factors that
					were
					affecting their business.<br />Instead of business slowly or quickly eroding due to market forces,
					Office Green embraced the changing market and remained flexible in how they approached their next
					project.<br />We’ll follow along with Office Green and your work as a project manager of Virtual
					Verde
					throughout this course and find out how you do.<br />[MUSIC PLAYING] So far, we’ve explored a little
					bit
					of Agile history, the Agile Manifesto, and some of the types of projects that benefit from an Agile
					approach.<br />Up next, I’ll introduce you to some specific methodologies under the Agile
					umbrella.<br />The most popular of these by far is Scrum.<br />In this video, I’ll briefly recount
					the
					origins of Scrum and discuss the basics of Scrum methodology.<br />So what the heck is
					Scrum?<br />Well,
					I’ll tell you first that it’s not an acronym.<br />If any of you have ever played or watched the
					sport
					of rugby, you may recognize the term.<br />For those that aren’t familiar with rugby, it’s similar
					to
					American football, a full-contact sport played on a field with a similar-shaped ball.<br />Scrum
					refers
					to a formation in rugby where all of the players on the team lean forward, lock their heads
					together,
					and then work as one unit to try and gain precious yards towards the scoring line.<br />The
					originators
					of the Scrum methodology saw their team as a heads-down group working very closely together to get
					that
					ball down the field, just like scrum in a rugby match.<br />So how does the Scrum methodology work
					as a
					project management methodology?<br />I’ll give you a brief overview here, and we’ll dive into it
					more
					throughout this course.<br />If you work in Agile Project Management, it’s highly likely that you’ll
					use
					Scrum or an approach that is based on Scrum.<br />In the 2019 State of Agile Report, 72% of teams
					using
					Agile methods were using Scrum or a hybrid.<br />When you use Scrum for project management, you form
					a
					team that will work together to quickly develop and test a deliverable.<br />The work is completed
					in
					short cycles, and the team meets daily to discuss current tasks and clear up anything that’s
					blocking
					their progress.<br />First, let’s review some terms and concepts specific to Scrum.<br />The backlog
					is
					the central artifact in Scrum, where all possible ideas, deliverables, features, or tasks are
					captured
					for the team to work on.<br />It’s prioritized and proactively managed by the team continuously
					throughout the life of the project.<br />The sprint is the name of the time-boxed period in Scrum
					where
					work is done.<br />The sprint can be between one and four weeks long, but most sprints are around
					two
					weeks.<br />This is often called the iteration.<br />And then there’s a practice called the Daily
					Scrum,
					also called the stand-up.<br />This is where the team meets for 15 minutes or less every day of the
					sprint to inspect their progress toward their goal.<br />Next are the rolls, the first of which is
					the
					Scrum master.<br />This role is responsible for ensuring that the team lives Agile values and
					principles, follows the processes and practices that the team agreed to, sharing information to the
					larger project team.<br />And they also help the team focus on doing their best work.<br />The other
					notable role in Scrum is the product owner, who is responsible for maximizing the value of the
					product
					and the work of the team.<br />The product owner owns the inventory of work and has the final say on
					how
					to prioritize the work.<br />And the development team is responsible for how a team will deliver
					that
					product.<br />Scrum is popular for many reasons.<br />First, it has clear roles and responsibilities
					for
					the folks on the team while continuously emphasizing the power of the team as a whole.<br />Scrum
					has a
					very regular and predictable meeting and delivery schedule with predefined agendas and outcomes for
					the
					meetings, making it easy to teach new team members.<br />It supports and reinforces the Agile values
					and
					principles while adding some structure and foundations that help new Agile teams get started and
					more
					experienced teams get better.<br />And it’s all free and open for all to use.<br />Since it’s the
					most
					commonly used Agile delivery framework, there’s also a huge amount of guidance and support online,
					as
					well as Scrum-specific training and certifications.<br />Scrum lends itself best to the following
					types
					of projects and teams.<br />Ideally, a Scrum team should be cross functional, with around three to
					nine
					team members.<br />Some call this a pizza-sized team because it has the same amount of people who
					could
					share a large pizza.<br />If the team is too small, you might not have the diversity of skills to
					get
					work done.<br />If the team is too large, it gets hard to distribute information.<br />Lastly, Scrum
					works best for projects where the team and management are open minded, adaptable, and value
					continuously
					learning how to be a better team.<br />Trying to force a team to do Scrum will almost always
					fail.<br />Note that in all of these examples, I never once mentioned the word
					software.<br />Although
					Scrum emerged from software projects, people have adapted Scrum to suit all kinds of projects from
					wedding planning to house moves to building rockets.<br />[MUSIC PLAYING] There are many popular
					Agile
					methodologies that are still around from the ’90s, when Agile was invented.<br />These methodologies
					share Agile values and principles but have very specific practices and applications.<br />In this
					video,
					I’ll touch on a few of the most popular ones besides Scrum, which we covered in the last
					video.<br />First, one of my personal favorites is Kanban.<br />This is a methodology that can be
					applied in a very simple way, or it can be used to drive the entire project.<br />The Kanban name
					comes
					from two Japanese words, kan, meaning “sign,” and ban, meaning “board.” You may have already used a
					Kanban board because it’s the most famous feature adopted by the majority of Agile
					enthusiasts.<br />The
					reason Kanban is so popular is that it provides transparent, visual feedback to everyone who might
					be
					interested about the status of work in progress.<br />Kanban boards or charts display the progress
					of a
					project as to do, in progress, and done.<br />Also, just so you know, there are software tools that
					create digital Kanban boards for you.<br />The Kanban method ensures that the project team only
					accepts
					a sustainable amount of in-progress work.<br />This means the amount of in-progress tasks are
					limited to
					what the team can actually handle during a certain amount of time.<br />This is called the
					Work-In-Progress limit, or WIP limit.<br />The WIP limit is decided on by the team.<br />This is a
					reflection of Agile in that teams are both self-organizing and empowered, and they’re operating at a
					sustainable pace.<br />The team members add new tasks to be completed only after they finish their
					previous task and are below the WIP limit.<br />This approach means that once a task has started to
					be
					worked on, it becomes a priority for the whole team to get it to done.<br />By focusing on less
					work,
					the work gets done faster.<br />This goal of trying to maximize efficiency is called Flow and is a
					core
					principle of Kanban.<br />Another Agile methodology is Extreme Programming, or XP.<br />It was named
					that because it took traditional software development activities to an extreme level.<br />But I
					also
					believe it’s because it emerged at the same time as extreme sports, like snowboarding.<br />XP is
					another one of my personal favorites.<br />It was the first Agile methodology I was introduced to
					back
					in my days, working on some of the original cell phones at Qualcomm, the company behind the radio
					technology we all use in our phones today.<br />Since XP came out of the software industry, it
					refers to
					specific software terms and activities, like coding and programming.<br />But the XP method can be
					used
					in lots of non-software environments as well.<br />The XP methodology aims to improve product
					quality
					and the ability to respond to changing customer needs.<br />It does this by taking best practices
					for
					the development process to extreme levels.<br />For example, one best practice is the idea of
					test-first
					development.<br />This means testing out parts of the product before building them in
					full.<br />Often,
					only the larger features get tested, which is still good but means some details might get
					missed.<br />XP takes this practice to the extreme by finding ways to test more and smaller features
					of
					the product to get even more feedback.<br />There are four basic activities that are performed
					during
					the product-development process that the XP method tries to enhance.<br />Designing– in software
					development, this is where you write a design document describing the parts of the code or
					instructions
					for the product and how it will function.<br />In non-software environments, this would be
					describing
					the various pieces and parts for whatever it is you’re trying to deliver.<br />For example, if
					you’re
					delivering an ad campaign, maybe the main pieces are the artwork, the copy, and the ad-buy
					plan.<br />XP
					wants to ensure that all of the pieces of the product will fit together properly, so it stresses
					simplicity.<br />Start with a simple design to meet the most basic and important
					requirements.<br />Simple designs also take less time to complete.<br />Once the basic model is
					designed
					and has been tested, then you can think about adding on other features.<br />Coding– code is the
					language that’s used to write software programs.<br />It’s the instructions that tell the computer
					what
					to do.<br />In software development, writing clear code is crucial, just like clear writing is
					crucial
					in any situation where you want to be understood.<br />XP demands clear and concise code so that
					others
					can easily read and understand the program.<br />This makes it easier to troubleshoot problems and
					come
					up with solutions.<br />In non-software environments, code would be similar to writing clear and
					concise
					processes or instructions for how to build or use your product.<br />Testing, like I described
					earlier,
					means checking the product for flaws so they don’t end up in the final product.<br />In XP, more is
					better.<br />So if a little bit of testing can eliminate a few flaws, lots of testing will eliminate
					even more.<br />The goal is to test for and eliminate any flaws in a feature before building it and
					continuing on.<br />Testing also means checking to make sure the product features meet the
					customer’s
					requirements, which leads us to listening, which is about listening to the customer and ensuring
					that
					the requirements are integrated into the product.<br />This relates to Agile in the way that it
					values
					customer collaboration, frequent communication, and regular feedback.<br />XP features some other
					innovative practices that are used across many Agile teams regardless of the specific methodology
					being
					used.<br />First, there’s pair programming, which is when two team members work together at the same
					time on one task.<br />Usually, this is done in the same physical location.<br />But with the use of
					digital collaboration tools, this can happen remotely, too.<br />Another practice is continuous
					integration and continuous refactoring.<br />This is the practice of merging product changes into a
					shared version several times a day in order to get quick feedback on the quality of the code or
					product.<br />Then there’s avoid big design upfront.<br />This relates to designing and means the
					design
					should be just enough to get started and should be continuously improved as the product
					evolves.<br />And finally, there’s write tests, not requirements.<br />This means that instead of
					writing a product requirements document and then later writing a test plan, your test plan can serve
					two
					purposes by, A, telling the team what to build, and, B, comparing what they built to what was
					supposed
					to be built.<br />OK, so we’ve got Scrum, Kanban, and XP.<br />Let’s explore one more.<br />For
					those of
					you who took the earlier courses in this program, you already learned a little bit about this final
					methodology called Lean, in the context of Lean Six Sigma.<br />Lean methodology consists of five
					principles that serve as a recipe for improving project outcomes.<br />They are define value, map
					value
					stream, create flow, establish pull, and pursue perfection.<br />Let’s break these down.<br />Define
					value means identifying and focusing on what the customer wants and including the customer in the
					process.<br />A product’s value is the sum of all the things the customer wants.<br />Map value
					stream
					means mapping out the process, or stream, including all the steps involved in producing value for
					the
					customer.<br />It also means challenging any steps that can be considered wasteful or
					unnecessary.<br />Create flow means ensuring the product flows through the value stream efficiently,
					continuing to eliminate waste throughout the cycle.<br />Work to remove interruptions, delays, and
					barriers to the workstream.<br />Establish pull– think of asking someone to pull something off the
					shelf.<br />You want to make sure the customer is pulling on the product or asking for it throughout
					the
					value stream.<br />They might pull or ask for features in incremental deliveries.<br />The idea is
					to
					make your process as smooth as possible so that the customer can pull on the product at any time,
					and
					you’ll be able to present what you’ve been working on or add a feature request.<br />Finally,
					there’s
					pursue perfection.<br />This means pushing your team to continuously improve the first four process
					steps.<br />So how does this relate to Agile?<br />Well, Agile emerged after Lean.<br />And the
					inventors of Agile were inspired to apply Lean-manufacturing principles to software
					development.<br />Like Agile, Lean is a set of principles and a value system.<br />Many of the
					differences are really just in the wording.<br />[MUSIC PLAYING] In the last video, we reviewed a
					few of
					the more popular methods for applying Agile values and principles to your projects.<br />We explored
					Kanban, which focuses on visualization and managing flow; XP, which is concerned with taking product
					development best practices to an extreme degree; and Lean, which actually predates Agile and aims to
					capture core principles that eliminate waste and deliver value to customers.<br />We’ve also
					compared
					Agile to Waterfall to form a better understanding of what each approach values or tries to
					accomplish
					and what kinds of projects they work best with.<br />Throughout these videos, we’ve explored Agile
					Project Management in a couple of different ways.<br />First, we explored Agile as a way of thinking
					about the project delivery process through the values and principles outlined in the Agile
					Manifesto.<br />Second, we explored Agile through different project delivery frameworks and methods,
					like Kanban, XP, and Lean, and especially through Scrum.<br />These two ways of applying Agile
					demonstrate that the real power of Agile comes from not only adopting certain processes or
					strategies
					but also from adopting a certain kind of mindset, one that is necessarily different from the
					traditional
					Waterfall models.<br />This means that you can still get some benefits from thinking in an Agile way
					and
					seek to apply those Agile values and principles from the Agile Manifesto even when you need to use a
					waterfall delivery approach.<br />So with all this Agile stuff bubbling around your heads, let’s do
					a
					quick recap on some of the key tenets of traditional Waterfall Project Management.<br />Then we’ll
					explore some of the ways you can blend the methods and approaches you’ve just learned about to best
					fit
					the needs of a specific project.<br />As we learned in earlier courses, a Waterfall project
					lifecycle is
					made up of the following phases– initiation, planning, executing and completing tasks, and closing
					out
					the project– and all of the tasks within each of these phases, like identifying goals and scope,
					scheduling, budgeting, and risk management.<br />Agile Project Management includes most of the same
					phases and tasks.<br />They’re just done in different ways.<br />So even though these two approaches
					have clear differences, blending them might make a lot of sense, depending on the type of project or
					project team you’re working with.<br />Here are some reasons you might want to blend Agile and
					Waterfall
					styles.<br />Your stakeholders, customers, or sponsors are more comfortable with traditional
					approaches
					and using workflows, or delivering traditional work products is easier for them to understand and
					follow.<br />But your project team is already established in Scrum, and they wish to
					continue.<br />Maybe there are regulatory requirements that insist on certain traditional work
					processes, such as large requirement documents for certifications.<br />Or it could be that one of
					the
					vendors involved in a large project is already following a traditional approach, and the integration
					between the teams requires some blending of methods.<br />In these cases, a project manager might
					choose
					to blend aspects of Waterfall and Agile so that different parts of the project can be worked on in
					ways
					that meet project requirements but don’t negatively impact other parts of the project or the project
					as
					a whole.<br />Let’s explore some more examples of how to blend methods.<br />Let’s say your project
					is
					to develop a software product.<br />During the retrospective for the last sprint, a team member
					says, I
					need to implement a certain feature, but I don’t have much experience building that particular
					feature.<br />Someone else on the team is an expert on that feature, so you decide to pair them up
					so
					they can work on building the feature together during the next sprint.<br />You’ve just blended XP
					and
					Scrum.<br />XP provides the basis for working in pairs, from pair programming.<br />And
					retrospectives
					are a key component of Scrum.<br />Here’s another incredibly common example.<br />Most Scrum teams I
					know use a Kanban board to track their progress through their sprint.<br />One word of warning,
					though–
					watch out for too much change in how you do things.<br />Teams work best when they can build up some
					consistency.<br />Let’s come back to Office Green.<br />As project manager of Virtual Verde, what
					types
					of methods might you want to use to get the project started?<br />Where would you blend some
					traditional
					methods and Agile methods?<br />Here are some factors to consider.<br />The existing plant suppliers
					are
					used to dealing with the original Plant Pals office delivery team.<br />Some of them might be
					interested
					in experimenting with an Agile approach but not all.<br />In this case, you’ll want to include those
					vendors in discussions early on to gain buy in and address any concerns.<br />Office Green also
					needs to
					really watch their costs, so you’ll want to use traditional budget-management controls to make sure
					they
					don’t go over budget on their program.<br />Well, that brings us to the end of this
					video.<br />Let’s
					review the key points I want you to take with you.<br />First, Agile is a mindset, a way of thinking
					about the project delivery process through the values and principles outlined in the Agile
					Manifesto.<br />Second, Agile values and principles can be achieved through certain frameworks and
					delivery methods, like Scrum, Kanban, XP, and Lean.<br />And finally, Agile and Waterfall are both
					effective ways of approaching project management that add specific value.<br />There are times when
					blending these styles will add even more value than sticking with just one.<br />So don’t be afraid
					to
					mix things up.<br />As long as different parts of the project can benefit from certain processes
					without
					negatively impacting the project as a whole, go for it.<br />ROWENA: Congratulations on finishing
