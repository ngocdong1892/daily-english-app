					meetings may differ, effective meetings always have the following elements in common– they are
					structured, intentional, collaborative, and inclusive.<br />Let’s study these elements in more
					detail.<br />First, effective meetings are structured.<br />This means they start and end on
					time.<br />The attendees have been carefully selected.<br />The meeting topics are
					prioritized.<br />And
					the designated notetaker has been assigned.<br />Managing the meeting time and audience lets
					participants know that they’re valued and appreciated.<br />Remember that everyone’s time is
					valuable.<br />If someone’s presence is unnecessary, you don’t need to invite them to the
					meeting.<br />Maybe you can share the notes.<br />Include people who can contribute to the
					discussion
					and anyone who will be directly affected by the topics discussed.<br />Structured meetings also have
					an
					agenda with prioritized topics, so the most important items are given appropriate
					attention.<br />It’s
					good to think about and set expectations for how long you expect the group to spend on a given
					topic.<br />This is defined as timeboxing, which just means you’re setting a time limit for
					discussion.<br />In a timebox, you give each topic a buffer of a few minutes to make sure you’re not
					overpacking your agenda.<br />Keep the meeting time in mind, and make sure you’ve scheduled enough
					time
					for the topic you need to cover.<br />If there are several topics you need to address, consider
					scheduling a few shorter meetings with just one or two topics as their focus.<br />After your first
					few
					team meetings, think about the pacing to know if you need to be more generous with the time given to
					each topic or if the group has time for a little more.<br />If you get through your topics before
					your
					time is up, don’t be afraid to call a meeting early.<br />Everybody loves having their time
					back.<br />Finally, a structured meeting should have a designated notetaker, so you or anyone else
					can
					refer to the meeting notes later and find out what was discussed.<br />The notetaker could be you or
					another meeting attendee.<br />For this reason, be clear about how, when, and to whom the meeting’s
					outcomes are shared.<br />Again, this all depends on the type of meeting you’re having and who is
					attending.<br />I’ll loop back to describe some different types of project meetings in the next
					video.<br />The next point to consider is that effective meetings are also intentional.<br />This
					means
					they have a clearly stated purpose and expectations, which should be in the meeting agenda as well
					as
					the meeting invite, so everyone understands why they’re attending.<br />The agenda needs to set
					clear
					expectations for what needs to occur before and during a meeting.<br />It helps attendees prepare,
					keeps
					everyone focused on the right topics, and clarifies meeting expectations and goals.<br />The purpose
					of
					your meeting might be to make a decision, assign tasks, propose and vet an idea, or something
					else.<br />Your meeting’s purpose or goal describes the reason you’re meeting and what you’d like to
					achieve.<br />A well-designed agenda increases the group’s ability to address problems and prevents
					wasting time.<br />For example, you may be reviewing last month’s business sales and setting goals
					for
					the next month.<br />Maybe your group needs to choose coordinators for an upcoming event, or your
					goal
					could be to have your supervisor prioritize a list of tasks.<br />The purpose might change from
					meeting
					to meeting, or it could stay the same.<br />If input is needed by attendees, be sure to send any
					pre-reading materials in advance of the meeting, so that everyone shows up prepared to
					participate.<br />Depending on the purpose, meetings can be formal or informal, have as few as two
					or
					three group members or have hundreds of attendees.<br />Whatever it is, make sure you state a clear,
					thoughtful purpose and strive to achieve that purpose by the end of the allotted time.<br />Another
					element of effective meetings is encouraging a collaborative environment.<br />Collaboration is when
					people work together to produce or create something.<br />There are lots of ways to make your
					meetings
					collaborative, even if the purpose is for one person to share important information with the rest of
					the
					group.<br />One easy way to do this is to be sure the agenda isn’t just full of presentations where
					participants are talked at.<br />Be sure the agenda is clear about the objectives of the
					session.<br />Will a decision be made, or is the session for information and
					discussion?<br />Second,
					have a digital, shared meeting document, and encourage participants to write any comments or
					thoughts
					directly in the document.<br />But more importantly, remind them that the notes will be
					shared.<br />This encourages active listening and participation in real time during the
					meeting.<br />Last, it’s important to respect and embrace each individual’s preferred communication
					style.<br />Even in meetings, especially in collaborative meetings, let folks know they’re welcome
					to
					respond verbally, through the chat, in the meeting notes, or in any other format you’d like to
					include.<br />The final element of an effective meeting is that it’s inclusive.<br />Inclusivity is
					the
					practice or policy of including people who might otherwise be excluded or marginalized.<br />When
					it’s
					done well, inclusion leads to excellent collaboration, ensuring that every participant’s
					contributions
					are valued.<br />As a project manager, you play a critical role in ensuring that meeting attendees
					feel
					supported and included.<br />So offering additional resources for ways to participate is
					helpful.<br />For both in-person and virtual meetings, consider appointing a meeting moderator or
					facilitator.<br />This person will guide the meeting and help participants ask questions in real
					time
					while someone else is presenting.<br />This way, the presenter can stay focused on their topic,
					while
					the moderator pays attention to the participants and can help guide participants on when they can
					chime
					in.<br />It’s also a good idea to leave space in the meeting for participants who’ve been
					quiet.<br />At
					the close of a topic or before the meeting ends, you might consider going around the room once in a
					while and asking each person to comment on a particular issue or question.<br />I like to call this
					a
					final flight check before everyone takes off and goes their separate ways.<br />A key component of
					inclusivity is ensuring that your meetings and presentations are accessible.<br />Another thing to
					consider is the level of internet access when conducting virtual meetings.<br />For those without
					strong
					internet access, provide a phone dial-in option.<br />Most online meeting tools, including Google
					Meet
					and Zoom, have this option.<br />Let participants know it’s OK to turn off their cameras if they
					need to
					improve the connection or adjust the video quality.<br />Focusing on inclusion helps build a sense
					of
					belonging and serves as a reminder that we live in a world with many different kinds of
					people.<br />Creating a meeting space where people of different views, backgrounds, and experiences
					can
					do their best work and be there for one another is key.<br />These tips aren’t exhaustive by any
					means.<br />But hopefully, they can be useful to start empowering others to meaningfully join in and
					contribute.<br />When done right, meetings can be incredibly useful communication tools.<br />That’s
					why
					it’s important to be purposeful when designing meetings that are structured, intentional,
					collaborative,
					and inclusive.<br />This will earn you a reputation for running efficient, inclusive, successful
					meetings where everyone feels appreciated, which is great for your project and your
					career.<br />[MUSIC
					PLAYING] Now that you’ve learned the key components for organizing and facilitating an effective
					team
					meeting, we’ll explore the specifics of some of the most common types of meetings you’ll need to
					have
					during a project.<br />Every project has meetings, lots of meetings.<br />While every meeting is
					unique,
					being familiar with the most common types of project management meetings will help you better
					identify
					the goals, structure, and activities best-suited for each one.<br />There are four general types of
					project management meetings– project kickoff, status updates, stakeholder reviews, and project
					reviews.<br />The first one we’ll talk about is the project kickoff meeting.<br />This is often
					considered the official beginning of a project and serves as a way to align the team’s understanding
					of
					the project goals with actual plans and procedures.<br />Members of your team are the major
					attendees of
					your kickoff meeting.<br />But the participation of senior management and key stakeholders is also
					required for securing buy-in and ensuring alignment with project goals.<br />The next type of
					meeting
					we’ll discuss are status update meetings.<br />Status update meetings are one of the most common
					types
					of meetings.<br />This category includes regular team meetings, where the primary goal is to align
					the
					team on updates, progress, challenges, and next steps.<br />During the meeting, the project manager
					may
					distribute or present project performance reports and formal status updates on key elements of the
					project.<br />This allows the team and stakeholders to gain visibility into current performance
					levels
					and task progress.<br />One of the project manager’s key responsibilities is to be aware of the
					status
					of the project at any given time and to ensure that others are up to speed or know where to find the
					latest information.<br />In order to do that, status updates become a critical tool throughout the
					lifecycle of a project to check in on the project.<br />Typically, you’ll assess the status of each
					of
					the following topics during this meeting.<br />First are task updates.<br />It is important for the
					attendees to know, what is the status of the most urgent tasks, how many tasks have been completed,
					and
					how many open items remain.<br />Next is schedule status.<br />Are we behind schedule, ahead of
					schedule, or on-pace with our projections?<br />Similarly, it’s common to discuss the budget status
					and
					any new items that impact your bottom line.<br />Then you should discuss current or anticipated
					issues–
					for example, changes, risks, resource issues, vendor issues, and so on– particularly changes to
					quality
					and scope.<br />It’s always a good idea to raise these items on a recurring basis, so that no one is
					caught off guard and you can discuss solutions together.<br />Lastly, you’ll want to discuss action
					items.<br />An action item is a task on your list that needs to be completed.<br />Assigning action
					items is a great way to wrap up the meeting and make sure the project keeps forging
					ahead.<br />Remember, every action item has an owner and a due date.<br />The status meeting is a
					fundamental project tool that keeps the project on-track.<br />Most project managers recommend using
					a
					relatively fixed agenda and time with this meeting.<br />To keep the team engaged, follow the agenda
					and
					hold the meeting to a tight schedule.<br />Because the project manager should be able to report
					up-to-date information to the project sponsors or clients at any time, it’s important to conduct
					status
					meetings regularly.<br />Status meetings are beneficial because they provide an opportunity for
					recognizing milestones, sharing information, and raising concerns to the team.<br />How often you
					decide
					to schedule these meetings depends on several factors, such as the project’s complexity, number of
					team
					members, and the level of information required by the project sponsor, clients, or
					others.<br />Don’t be
					afraid to change up the cadence as your project progresses.<br />Another type of project management
					meeting is a stakeholder meeting.<br />Stakeholder engagement is essential for successful project
					management.<br />The goal of a stakeholder meeting is to get buy-in and support.<br />Stakeholders
					each
					have their own set of tools, knowhow, and expertise.<br />Stakeholder meetings are where these
					contributions are outlined and utilized.<br />You’ll need to start by understanding a stakeholder’s
					challenges or problems, then respond accordingly and make necessary adjustments to resolve those
					challenges.<br />Winning and sustaining the support of your stakeholders is important to your
					project’s
					success.<br />In some cases, you might want to have stakeholder meetings on a one-on-one
					basis.<br />This allows you to dive deeper on relevant details with each stakeholder.<br />Then you
					can
					cover the topics that are most interesting and concerning to that particular person.<br />Other
					times,
					you’ll need to engage stakeholders in groups.<br />If you have a large number of stakeholders to
					manage,
					focus the meeting on your project’s most influential stakeholders.<br />Identify appropriate
					stakeholders for high-touch communication.<br />For example, you may focus the meeting on senior
					managers from each of the groups you need to engage.<br />Other stakeholders can be informed using
					other
					methods, such as email or meeting notes.<br />While there are a number of potential topics to cover
					when
					meeting with stakeholders, most meetings are limited to communicating critical information.<br />You
					should always be able to present a project update.<br />Start the meeting with a short overall
					project
					status update of two to five minutes.<br />Another key reason to meet with stakeholders is to seek
					out
					and listen to feedback.<br />Or you might meet with stakeholders to make a decision or resolve a
					major
					issue surrounding your project.<br />In this case, you’ll often meet with senior leaders and the
					project
					sponsor.<br />Decisions could include go or no-go decisions, a choice between options, or signing
					off on
					investments.<br />Stakeholder meetings are generally more formal.<br />It’s normal to prepare
					reading
					materials and documents to review ahead of time to help get people in the right mindset for the
					meeting.<br />Stakeholder meetings can be regular and recurring or just a one-off project
					meeting.<br />The frequency will depend on why the stakeholder is involved in the project.<br />Are
					they
					playing an advisory role, such as a consultant and a RACI, or just someone to inform and keep in the
					loop?<br />Does their involvement center around just one activity on the project, or do they need to
					stay involved on a longer-term basis?<br />You’ll need to decide on a case-by-case basis.<br />The
					end
					of the project, or the end of the project phase, is an excellent opportunity to review how the
					project
					unfolded.<br />This is called a retrospective.<br />A typical retrospective meeting agenda includes
					reviewing lessons learned about what’s going well, what you should keep doing, and what can be
					improved.<br />Equally important to reviewing lessons learned is taking the opportunity to celebrate
					the
					project’s success.<br />Knowing the difference between these project meeting types allows you to
					maximize productivity and ensure that you’re not wasting time.<br />You’ll get the right outcome
					from
					each type of meeting, which will help drive decisions and lead to proactive, positive actions.<br />
