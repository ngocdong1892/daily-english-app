					do you have a plan T plan to improve your English in 2025 to Eng if not this video is for [Music]
					you hello everybody in this video I am going to help you make a plan a plan to imp improve your
					English in this new year of 2025 I'm going to teach you how to make an effective plan to see real
					results with your English and how to stick to it are you ready to improve your English let's go step
					number one the first step choose your tools okay for any goal you're going to need tools that will
					allow you to accomplish it the tools or the things that you choose to help you reach your goals are
					key so what tools are you going to choose well in my opinion the first thing that you need to think
					of is are you going to invest money in this process or are you going to search for tools that are
					free luckily in this day and age there is an abundance of free tools online that will help you reach
					your goals and the best part some of them are incredible wonderful however ever there are also a
					couple that I will tell you guys about that you have to pay for but it's up to you whether you have
					the extra money to invest in this schal or whether you want to spend a little bit more time
					searching for free tools so let's start with the free tools okay guys this is the day of the
					internet there are so many tools you can use you can have conversations with chat GPT on your phone
					you can go on YouTube and search for structured courses free beginner courses of English free
					intermediate courses of English okay all of those things are out there or if you prefer a more
					natural approach you can look at my videos or other creators like myself where we make
					comprehensible input okay on my channel there are hundreds of videos where I speak a nice slow
					intermediate English about life topics that are interesting easy to understand and will help you to
					acquire my native language of English okay so we talked a little bit about some of the free sources
					you could just type on YouTube free course intermediate English you could check out my Channel or
					other creators like myself that may comprehensible input or you can search to find your favorite
					free language learning app I recommend possibly checking out dualingo or Babel just because they're
					super easy everybody knows about them and uh you don't have to look too hard however if if you want
					to pay to invest in your your language learning I'm going to tell you about two of my favorite tools
					that I still use to this day okay first the application link okay Steve Kaufman is an awesome
					polyglot he speaks like 20 languages a lot of you guys have probably seen his videos I'm a huge fan
					when I first started language learning I watched all of Steve's videos well Steve believes that
					reading is very important in language learning I agree we're going to talk a little bit more about
					reading a little later in the video but his app is incredible link now here in the United States at
					least it costs $12 per month however I think that if you're going to invest some money in your
					language learning that is the best $12 that you can spend because this app will allow you to acquire
					so much vocabulary okay if you enjoy reading link is a must I have read entire novels on link in
					Spanish and French and have acquired so many new words highly recommend that you check out link but
					it is not free okay you have to pay second tool that I highly recommend I talkie okay I'm sure most
					of you have heard of italki it is a website where you can pay uh teacher to give you private lessons
					Okay now some of these people are certified teachers certified English teachers some of them are
					just people like me and you who enjoy language learning they're native speakers and they want to
					share their language with the world okay either way you go you can do structured courses with a
					certified teacher or tutor on it talkie or you can have free form conversations like you are sitting
					there with a friend I talkie is incredible guys and depending on where this person is from where
					they live what their experience level is it can be very affordable or some can be quite expensive
					but if you are going to invest money in your language learning I highly recommend italki I have had
					over 200 lessons on italki and have met with over 80 teachers and absolutely loved every
					conversation I've ever had on there I have spoken with Spanish speakers from all over the world I've
					spoken French with people from France people from Canada people from the Middle East and Africa it
					is an incredible resource but like I said it is not free however if you want to invest a little bit
					of money in your language learning check out I talking two the Second Step commit yourself to your
					goals now that we've chosen our tools we've chosen our tools it is time to commit yourself to using
					them because the best tool guys the best tool in the whole world is useless it does nothing unless
					you pick it up and use it okay so now comes a very important part of this process where you commit
					yourself to doing it okay I remember when I was trying to learn Spanish I wrote down my goals I was
					going to read one article every day on link and I was going to watch at least one video of dreaming
					Spanish every day which is my favorite Spanish resource for comprehensible input on YouTube and that
					was the absolute minimum okay so I did that no matter what and on days where I had more free time I
					would read three articles and watch five videos okay but what I recommend is you make a commitment
					okay say you choose a free course on YouTube okay you're commitment will be that you will watch at
					least one video of the course each day okay no matter what no matter what happens in your day you
					watch that video okay because you are committed you are committed to learning English and it is this
					commitment guys it is this commitment that will see you through to the end of your goal to see real
					results in your English step number three expose yourself to a wide wide variety of different
					content okay guys so this could mean finding three or four different YouTubers that you enjoy okay
					like me I speak the very neutral Midwestern United States English okay very common this is what the
					the actors and the movies from the US speak okay however there are so many different accents that
					you can choose from you can find somebody from Britain from Scotland from Ireland from the south of
					the United States okay from Australia there are a ton of different accents in the English language
					and I highly recommend that you explore each of these accents because you don't want to be in the
					situation one day where you've only listened to people who sound like me and then you have to have a
					conversation with somebody from Britain because that will be very difficult so guys that is one
					thing that I'm very happy about with my Spanish Learning Journey I have listened to every accent
					probably close to every accent in the Spanish speaking World okay I've watched shows from Colombia
					Mexico spoken with Venezuelans watched shows from Spain okay I've Expos myself to so much different
					Spanish that I'm never surprised when I hear something new and that is exactly what I think you
					should do with your English Okay so try your best to listen to people with different different
					accents read different books from different time periods okay because the English they were speaking
					50 years ago 100 years ago 200 years ago is completely different than the English that I speak right
					now and on another note the English that my son speaks is completely different from what I speak
					from what I speak is completely different from what a politician would speak so guys try your best
					to pick a little bit from over here little bit from over there put it all together so you have a
					well-rounded English step number four try new things don't be afraid to try new things this can mean
					looking online for a speaking partner okay I promise you you may be think there's nobody in my city
					that cares about English okay I live in a small town in Mexico small town in Venezuela none of my
					friends speak English none of my family members speak English I don't know who to talk to well if
					you're watching this video you have internet which means you have someone to talk to okay I promise
					you somewhere on the other side of the earth is a guy like me who speaks English and wants to
					practice his Spanish you can do that trade with somebody search language exchanges things like that
					and you will find someone okay don't be scared to make mistakes Express Yourself try new things all
					right now I said earlier I was going to talk a bit about reading if you are not reading in English
					please please my friend give it a chance when I started to read in Spanish my Spanish exploded guys
					a book has so many thousands of words and there are going to be so many words that you do not know
					it's going to be a little bit slow at first you're going to be reading slower you're going to have
					to guess a couple of the words but believe believe me when you get through that first book your
					first book in English you will be so surprised by how much your English has improved okay because
					what are books books are thoughts written down okay thoughts structured in the language that it was
					written in you are consuming that you are putting those thoughts in your brain and those thoughts
					are correct grammatically they are written correctly and checked by an editor okay so as you are
					absorbing that information you are absorbing good English your brain maybe you don't realize it but
					your brain is learning how we structure sentences how we use verbs adjectives adverbs how we use
					these different parts of a sentence okay you're learning new ways to use them new words to express
					the same thoughts guys winners read winners read period read try something new and number five
					number five guys I saved this one for last this could have been the first one but because I think it
					is actually the most important I saved it for last this step is going to decide whether you succeed
					or you fail on your English learning Journey or really any goal in your life this step is the most
					important part of this whole process in this step I want you to seriously think about the why why do
					you want to learn English and your answer to that question is what is going to decide whether you
					succeed and one day speak English or whether you quit in a couple of weeks so guys if you don't have
					a strong reason why you want to accomplish any goal The Temptations in life will be too strong and
					you'll give up okay when your friends call you to come hang out instead of doing your studying
					you'll go because you don't have a strong reason but when you make up your mind I'm going to learn
					this this language because this reason and nothing is going to stop me that is when you will succeed
					so my friends why do you want to learn English what is the reason and what is it going to change in
					your life think about how it is going to make your life better okay is it for a new job that going
					to pay you more money allow you to travel allow you to meet new people is it because you've already
					met some people who speak English and you want to be able to spend time with them get to know them
					better is it because you want to move to a different country what is your reason guys think about
					your reason and really get it firm in your head this is why I'm doing this this is how it's going to
					change my life and I will not quit period when you make up your mind and you have it firm in your
					brain why you want to do this and you promise yourself that you're not going to quit no matter what
					until you reach your goal that is when you will not be defeated when you will reach your goal and
					you will improve your English in 2025 all right my friends my name is Kyle singer thank you for
