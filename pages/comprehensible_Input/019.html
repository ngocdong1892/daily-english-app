					Are you ready to learn some real life English with comprehensible input? Well, good, because today
					we are going to improve our English by talking about something that I think is so important and that
					everybody needs to have in their lives, goals. Let's go. Hey guys, it is your English speakaking
					friend, Kyle. And today I've got another great video for you guys that is full of useful vocabulary
					in English and it might just help you improve in other areas of your life as well. Today we're
					talking about goals. What are goals?<br>
					Goals are something that you want to achieve, something that you really want to do in your life,
					something that you want to get, something that you want to improve. And it is something that is very
					important for me and I think it should be important for you too. So in this video I'm going to share
					with you guys the goals that I am trying to achieve in my life and all that you have to do is listen
					absorb the natural English and maybe even think about the goals in your life too. So what are the
					goals in my life? All right. So my first first goal, the first goal that I'm working on right now at
					this stage of my life is to get into better shape. Okay.<br>
					Now to get in shape means that you exercise and you eat good so that your body will be healthier and
					look better.<br>
					Okay. Now we say that somebody is in shape. Wow, that guy is in shape. That lady is in good shape.
					We say that somebody is in shape or in good shape when they have big muscles and when they do not
					have a lot of fat. Okay, a lot of fat. So, that is one of my goals that I've been working a lot on
					and I think I've been doing pretty good. I've been going to the gym consistently and I've been
					eating healthy food. I try and make sure that at least 85% of the food that I eat is good healthy
					food. meat, fruits, vegetables, rice, natural, real foods. Now, I eat a little bit of food that is
					not very good for you, but only a little bit. So, that's how I'm trying to work on this goal because
					it's not only important to know your goals, but to make a plan of how you're going to achieve it.
					So, each time I tell you one of these goals, I'll tell you what I'm doing in my life or what I need
					to do to achieve the goal. Cuz that's the most important part. That's what goals are for, right? To
					achieve them. So guys, when I was like 28 years old, now I'm 33. I will be 34 next month. We'll do a
					cool birthday video, don't worry. When I was 28, I was in very good shape, okay?<br>
					Because I was running a lot. I was running every week. I was lifting weights several times a week, a
					couple of times every week, and I was training Brazilian jiu-jitsu every week. So, I was constantly
					exercising, guys. and I had no fat. My muscles were bigger and stronger, and I felt very good about
					my body. So, that's goal number one, to get back in good shape like I was when I was 28. Now, what's
					my next goal? All right, guys. Goal number two. My second goal that I want to really start working
					on is to make some new friends. I want to make some new friends with people who do interesting
					things, with people who are successful, with people who want to improve their lives like I do.<br>
					Unfortunately guys, a lot of my friends from my past, they are not thinking about how can I improve
					my future? What can I do today so that I could be better tomorrow? No. A lot of them just want to
					have fun. They want to drink alcohol, do dumb things. they still do the same thing that we used to
					do 10 years ago.<br>
					And I don't want to be around people like that. So, I want to meet some new friends who are trying
					to improve, who have cool hobbies, and who have interesting lives that they could share with me and
					I could share the interesting things that I do with them.<br>
					So, how can I meet some new friends?
					Well, I guess I need to think about what kind of people I want to be friends with. Like I said, I
					want people who are learning, who are doing cool things, who are always improving. So maybe I could
					start going to language groups where people go and practice their language.<br>
					There are some that are kind of close to me in Chicago. Maybe that would be a good place to look for
					some friends.
					Maybe I could join some sort of new sport and meet some people who are into fitness who could help
					me with my fitness journey. I'm not sure yet where I will meet them, but this is something that I
					know I need to work on because yeah, I have I still do have a couple of good friends who are
					interesting and do interesting things and I like to be around, but if you want new experiences and
					new things in your life, you need to meet new people as well. So, that is a goal of mine that I'm
					going to work on.<br>
					Make some new interesting, successful, and intelligent friends. It's really hot out here, guys. I am
					sweating. Starting to sweat.<br>
					It's hot. Anyway, back to the goals. My next goal is a travel goal. A goal about traveling, about
					where I want to travel, where I want to go. Okay, so I have already traveled in South America. I've
					traveled in North America. Now, I want to see other continents. So, my traveling goal is to go to a
					country in Europe, at least one country. to go to a country in Asia, at least one country, and to go
					to a country in Africa, at least one country. Maybe one day Australia, but that's very far away and
					I'm not very interested in that. So, my traveling goal is to go to at least one country in each of
					those continents, experience the culture there, eat the food there, and talk with the people there,
					see what life is like in those places. So hopefully in this next year that's coming, I'll be able to
					accomplish one of those either going to Europe, Africa, or Asia. Well, I'm pretty confident that
					I'll do at least one of those next year.<br>
					And I can't wait and I'll be bringing you guys with me. Don't worry about that. All right, guys.
					Now, I know that you guys like to learn about English and the life here in the US, my life, but I
					also want to learn about you guys. Now, we've got subscribers all over the world. So, I want to take
					a little bit of time and learn about you guys. Today, we're going to talk a little bit about the
					country, Sri Lanka. So, here are some interesting facts about Sri Lanka.
					So, one that is a little bit strange here. When somebody asks you a question, if you want to say
					yes, you do this.<br>
					Mhm. Yes. If you want to say no, you do this. Mm- No. In Sri Lanka, it is common if somebody asks
					you a question and you want to say yes to do this.
					That's so confusing. Sri Lankan friends, is that true? Next fact. Cricket is a popular sport in Sri
					Lanka, but the official national sport is volleyball.<br>
					There is a place in Sri Lanka called the temple of the tooth. And it is said that in this temple
					they have one of Buddha's teeth. Sedarta Gtoma the Buddha. They have one of his teeth in this temple
					they say. So it is an important Buddhist site. Sri Lanka was the first country to elect a female
					prime minister. And the last quick fact that we'll learn about Sri Lanka is that the oldest tree
					that was planted by people in the world is in Sri Lanka and it is a bodie tree. Just another
					interesting little fact is that the Bodhi tree is the kind of tree that the Buddha was supposedly
					sitting under when he reached Nirvana or enlightenment.<br>
					Pretty cool. Let's get back to the video. All right, guys. And the last goal that I'm going to talk
					about today has been a goal of mine for a long time now, and it is to grow this YouTube channel to
					100,000 subscribers.<br>
					I've been working hard on this channel for a long time, guys. And finally, it looks like I'm going
					to achieve this goal. At the rate that the channel has been growing, we will be at 100,000
					subscribers probably in about 2 months, maybe less. So, hopefully that will keep going. Hopefully,
					the channel will keep growing at that same rate and I will achieve this goal that has been my goal
					for years now. Some of you guys may think that I'm a new YouTuber because you just found me, but no.
					I've been helping people with their English for four years now here on this channel. And finally,
					the channel is starting to get big. Hard work, discipline, and dedication pays off, guys. And this
					channel is an example of it. All right.<br>
					So, if you are still watching, I know that you are dedicated to your goal of learning English. So,
					tell me in the comments, guys. I want you to write me a list. What are your goals? What are you
					working on in your life right now? What are the things that you want to achieve?<br>
					Thank you guys for coming on this little adventure with me and talking with me about our goals. See
					you in the next
