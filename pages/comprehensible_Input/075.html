					[Music] thank you hello my friends hello my friends my name is Kyle and today I am going to speak in
					my normal English okay I'm normal English like I speak with my friends like I speak with my friends
					like I speak with my family how I speak when I'm at my job or when I meet somebody new here who
					speaks English to be honest is actually a little bit strange for me because normally when I'm
					sitting here in front of my camera with the lights on got my background normally I use my
					intermediate English okay I use my hands I say a little bit of Spanish to make sure that you guys
					can follow me but some of you guys you said that you're ready for an advanced video you want to see
					if you can understand me when I speak normal okay now I'm not really a very fast speaker I'm not
					somebody who blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah very very fast okay but this is how I speak
					when I'm talking to people in my normal day-to-day life when I'm talking to people who only speak
					English so today today I am going to talk about the three best choices that I have made in my life
					okay life is all about choices that's all that life is it's choices you could choose to do the good
					thing you could choose to do the wrong thing and then later later you will pay the price believe me
					I know I have seen I have seen that when you do good things you will reap the benefits and rewards
					but when you do bad things you will pay the price the Bible says you will reap what you sow and that
					is true my friends very very true so the first the first of the three best choices that I have made
					Choice number one was to learn Spanish honestly guys sincerely learning Spanish has been one of the
					best things that I have ever done in my entire life it has been so satisfying to me I've met amazing
					people from all over the world I've had amazing amazing conversations with people from Venezuela
					Spain Mexico Colombia Ecuador okay Costa Rica Puerto Rico I've had conversations with people from
					all over the world I've got to hear about their lives how they live their lives okay I've learned so
					much about culture Latino culture about the food okay I have had I've got to try so many amazing
					foods and sure it's cool to try different foods even if you don't know about the culture but when
					you speak the language when you know about the culture when you've had experiences with the people I
					don't know maybe I'm weird but to me that makes the experience of the food much better and it's
					always cool if you can go to a restaurant and read the menu well okay so when I go to a Colombian
					restaurant or a Mexican restaurant and nobody there speaks English and they're all looking looking
					at me weird when I walk in it's okay because I understand I've been able to read new books watch new
					series on Netflix watch movies because of learning Spanish I've made new friends and maybe most
					importantly I've met a beautiful woman a beautiful woman who has changed my life and if I had not
					started learning Spanish years ago a couple years ago I think I have two and a half three years now
					learning Spanish but if I had not done that years ago I would never have been able to meet the woman
					who I fell in love with okay in Spanish the woman who I asked to marry me Okay so Spanish has been a
					blessing to me it has changed my life I feel more confident okay I feel so confident when I speak
					Spanish and I hope you guys feel that same way when you speak English okay because you know you
					worked hard for that you worked hard for that you earned the right to speak in that language so do
					it with confidence okay when you're speaking English chest out head up okay look people in the eyes
					because you worked hard for that so be proud of it and be confident in yourselves okay another very
					special thing another reason why it was so important to me why Spanish has been so important to me
					is because earlier on in my life when I was younger I tried a lot of things okay I tried to learn
					guitar I tried going to do Sports at school and when I was younger I'm not proud to say it but I
					quit Okay I quit when things got hard I quit so it wasn't until later in my life that I learned to
					start something and finish it I always finish what I start because I learned okay now learning
					Spanish once I made the goal of learning Spanish and I actually did it that changed that changed
					something in my mind because now I know now I have the confidence I am sure I am positive 100 if I
					make a goal and I go after it and I work hard on it every day I know that I can achieve it because I
					learned Spanish I learned French I learned Jujitsu I've done all these things and the only
					difference between somebody who achieves their goals and somebody who does not is that the person
					who achieves it does not stop they don't quit okay I don't quit I don't quit because I don't quit
					that's a quote from a country singer named Johnny Cash so learning Spanish gave me the confidence
					that I could achieve whatever I try to do and now I know in the future if I need to learn another
					language I could do it if I need to learn another skill I know I could do it because I've already
					done it all right I've already done it if I did it before I know I can do it again the second of the
					three most important choices that I've made in my life was to start this YouTube channel now maybe
					you guys are thinking oh well starting a YouTube channel is not that important it's not a big part
					of your life why why is that so important to you starting this channel has been so important to me
					because it's given me the opportunity to help okay to help you guys to reach your goals all right
					and when you guys tell me you guys tell me in the comments oh this helped me this video helped me so
					much I learned new words thank you for your time we appreciate you you guys don't know that stuff
					touches me right here in my heart okay uh and it's just so special to me it's it's been uh such a
					special experience that I have not had before because I haven't had the opportunity to help so many
					people in different places and now that I have that opportunity I'm gonna keep going I'm gonna do my
					best I'm gonna give you guys the most value for your time that I possibly can that's why I committed
					to making three videos each week because I know that to learn a language you need a lot of content a
					lot of content so that's why I pump them out I keep pumping them out every week every week okay now
					I know maybe you guys are using apps and stuff too maybe you're watching shows other stuff in
					English but I want to make sure that at least at least I know for sure you guys got three quality
					videos each week that's how I'm doing my part I hope it's helping you guys and just know that you
					guys are helping me every time you guys tell me I'll keep going keep going thank you that's helping
					me so I'm achieving my goal and you guys are achieving yours we work together everybody's gonna be
					better all right starting this channel has taught me a lot of lessons when I was making these videos
					for three subscribers five subscribers 10 subscribers okay it taught me that you have to be
					persistent okay you can't just uh do something once and hope that a bunch of people are gonna come
					you got to keep going and going and going okay so that's what I'm doing every day we're growing a
					little more uh as of today we have 1200 something subscribers and I just know that's going to keep
					going and going and going we're going to keep growing you guys are going to keep learning I'll keep
					getting better at making this content so you guys will have better content every week to help you
					further your goals this channel has given me a mission okay a mission in my life a Direction all
					right I've got my job I have my bills all right I have responsibilities but this channel gives me
					something that I look forward to okay I look forward to making these videos I look forward to
					knowing if it's helping you guys to seeing you guys get better oh man let me tell you guys something
					that really makes me so happy when some of you guys have always wrote me in Spanish okay you know
					you always wrote me in Spanish that's awesome I love when you guys write me in Spanish because then
					I could practice my Spanish by reading but when the people who have always written in Spanish write
					me in English I'm like whoa I'm like yes because I see you guys are getting better okay and I see
					when you guys are sending me your uh your comments you're making less mistakes you're speaking well
					you're writing longer so cool and I'm proud of you guys I'm really proud of you guys I'm proud of
					all of you who have been sticking with me all this time okay I'm proud of you for sticking to your
					goals and improving your English you guys are very special to me and I just want you to know how
					much I appreciate each and every one of you okay so you guys keep going and I'll keep going too the
					third choice in my life that I am very proud of making was fighting for my son okay now I say
					fighting for my son because a lot of you guys know I'm a single father and in the state that I live
					in Indiana everybody says that it is what you call a mother State okay a mother State means that the
					mom of the child the mother of the child she has all of the rights to the child okay if you're
					married and you get a divorce automatically the mom gets the kids until you go to court and make an
					order okay so when the mother of my child and I split up years years ago she had all the rights to
					my son okay but she was not doing good she was doing terrible stuff so I knew that I had to get my
					son out of that situation so it was hard it was hard and uh I've talked about in the past and I'm
					I'm working on some content where I could talk about this more but I just want to say it was very
					hard I had to fight a custody battle which is going to court getting a lawyer and it's not easy and
					it's not quick I spent over a year fighting a custody battle for my son I'm still going to court
					okay and it's been a lot of money that I've had to spend but uh a lot of money a lot of pain okay
					it's been hard been tears all right it's been hard but I'm very happy that I decided to fight for my
					son for me it was not even a choice okay uh for the people that I love my family okay my siblings my
					mom my son my girl I'm gonna fight for you there's no I don't have to think about it I'm gonna do
					anything I can to help those people out to take care of them to protect them that's who I am okay
					that's in me I can't change it I have to protect the people I love so it wasn't a choice for me but
					I call it a choice because I know so many so many guys who don't they just don't care okay about
					their kids they don't they see their kids once a month once a week they don't care okay they're out
					drinking and having fun but I stepped up I fought for my son okay and now my son lives with me I
					every night every night I tuck my son into bed I wake him up and get him ready for school okay I
					feed him my mom helps a ton I have an awesome mom my son has an awesome Grandma but I'm very proud
					very proud that I chose to fight for my son not just to say okay well it's hard it's too expensive
					so I'll see him every week no I fought for my son I did what was right my son lives with me where
					he's safe and because I fought hard today my son is happy he's healthy he's doing good in school
					okay and I could not be more proud of that so my friends I hope you guys understood this all right
					if you didn't understand it very well you understood fifty percent sixty percent seventy percent
					just keep going that just means you got more work to do and you'll enjoy the process enjoy the
					process my friends and when you arrive at the destination it'll all be worth it okay so what I
					normally say you guys know how I end my videos today I'll say it in English like always my friends
					thank you so much for watching and we'll see you soon
