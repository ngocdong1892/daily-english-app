					influencing?<br />Influencing is the ability to alter another person’s thinking or
					behaviors.<br />We’ll
					discuss the concept of influencing in the context of our Plant Pals Project at Office
					Green.<br />Let’s
					say that your team would like to partner with a well-known chocolate manufacturer to create a bundle
					deal.<br />With this deal, the client could choose to add on a high quality chocolate bar with each
					plant they purchase.<br />You decide to send an initial email to a partnership manager at the
					chocolate
					manufacturer to gauge their interest in the idea and ultimately influence them to work with
					you.<br />So, how do you go about writing that email that effectively influences your audience to
					consider your idea?<br />Well, it turns out there are four tried and true steps of effective
					influencing.<br />Leadership expert Dr. Jay Conger identifies the steps to effective influencing as
					establish credibility, frame for common ground, provide evidence, and connect
					emotionally.<br />Let’s
					discuss each step.<br />The first step to effective influencing is to establish
					credibility.<br />During
					this step, you make the case for why your audience should listen to you.<br />According to
					Dr.<br />Conger, credibility comes from two sources– expertise and relationships.<br />You need to
					demonstrate to your audience that you are an expert on a given topic, whether that’s through
					professional experience, extensive research or something else.<br />And you need to demonstrate
					relationship credibility by establishing that you’re honest, trustworthy, and someone who they’d
					want to
					work with.<br />To establish credibility, you might kick off your Office Green email by greeting the
					recipient by name, then writing something like, I’m Elita, a lead project manager at Office
					Green.<br />Your colleague Alex passed on your contact information.<br />Alex and I worked together
					to
					launch new services at Office Green before she joined your organization.<br />In these opening
					lines,
					you’ve established expertise credibility by introducing your role at Office Green and by subtly
					highlighting that you’ve launched new services in the past.<br />And to demonstrate relationship
					credibility, you’ve established that you and the recipient have a shared contact who has worked
					closely
					with you in the past and can vouch for your trustworthiness and emotional intelligence.<br />The
					second
					step is to frame for common ground.<br />In this step, you’ll make the case for how your idea can
					benefit your audience.<br />To determine this, you’ll need a strong understanding of your audience
					and
					their values.<br />In essence, what about your idea will appeal to them?<br />And how will they
					stand to
					benefit from agreeing to your idea?<br />In our Office Green email, you might establish that you’ve
					researched their organization extensively and believe that this new service might align with their
					current offerings.<br />For example, you might write something like this, we’re launching a service
					to
					provide top clients with desk plants, and we’d like to explore a bundle offering to pair high
					quality
					chocolate with each plant order.<br />I’ve admired your organization’s push in recent years to work
					with
					other lifestyle and wellness brands, and I think there may be a great opportunity for us to
					collaborate.<br />In this portion of the email, you’ve established that you’ve done your research on
					the
					organization and that their previous partnerships indicate that working together might be a great
					fit.<br />The next step is to provide evidence.<br />In this step, you’ll make your case through
					hard
					data and persuasive storytelling.<br />Numbers aren’t strong enough on their own.<br />They need
					stories
					to liven them up.<br />In our Office Green email, you might appeal to your recipient with a line
					like,
					we recently surveyed clients to gauge interest in this kind of offering, and your brand came up
					again
					and again.<br />In this example, you’ve provided evidence through the results of client surveys
					which
					showed overwhelmingly positive brand recognition for our shared audience.<br />The last step is to
					connect emotionally.<br />In this step, you’ll demonstrate to your audience that you’re emotionally
					committed to your idea and you’ll do your best to match their emotional state.<br />In our Office
					Green
					email, you might demonstrate an emotional connection by tapping into their brand ethos.<br />For
					example, you might write something like, we’ve been following your profile on Instagram and love
					your
					post on chocolate’s connection to living a well and balanced lifestyle.<br />Perhaps we can discuss
					combining forces to bring this message to an even wider audience?<br />And then you end your note
					with a
					friendly closer.<br />Something like, if you’re interested, I’d love to connect and share what our
					partner program is all about.<br />To recap, establishing credibility, framing for common ground,
					providing evidence and connecting emotionally are four proven effective steps you can apply when
					attempting to influence other.<br />Dr. Conger also identified four common mistakes that people make
					when attempting to influence others.<br />They’ll often approach their audience too aggressively,
					and
					that tends to put people off ideas entirely.<br />They might also resist compromise, which is
					crucial
					for any kind of mutual agreement.<br />They’ll focus too much on developing their argument for the
					idea
					and not enough time establishing credibility, framing for common ground, providing evidence, and
					connecting emotionally.<br />And they’ll assume that they can work out an agreement through just one
					conversation.<br />These mistakes can jeopardize your attempts to influence others and limit your
					ability to build relationships.<br />So be mindful of these common mistakes when preparing to pitch
					another person on your big idea.<br />But influencing is about more than just your approach.<br />In
					fact, so much of your ability to influence others comes from your own sources of
					power.<br />Throughout
					your career, you’ll rely on your sources of power to influence others to do great work in service of
					the
					project goals.<br />In his book, “The Elements of Power, Lessons on Leadership and Influence,” the
					researcher, Terry Bacon, determined that most power sources fall into two buckets– organizational
					and
					personal.<br />From these power sources, we picked out the ones we feel are most important to cover
					here.<br />Let’s start with organizational sources of power, which include your role, information,
					network and reputation.<br />First, we have your role, which refers to your position within an
					organization or team.<br />In a project management role, you have a certain level of power over the
					project, and therefore more influence.<br />Information is another source of organizational power,
					which
					refers to your level of access and control over information.<br />As a project manager, you possess
					a
					huge amount of information about your work and your stakeholders, which can work to your
					benefit.<br />Now, it may be tempting to assume that as a leader you have all of the
					answers.<br />But
					to be a good influencer, you should ask questions and consider all ideas.<br />You may even hear new
					insights and notice issues in a different way.<br />Share information with your team regularly so
					that
					they can provide input on the full picture.<br />You can also derive power from your
					network.<br />This
					refers to people you’re connected with professionally and personally.<br />Strong connections within
					your organization and beyond it can boost your ability to influence others and help your project
					continue on.<br />If you demonstrate that you’re well connected and have a good chance of getting
					stakeholder support or budget approval for your plans, then you’re more likely to get your audience
					on
					your side.<br />You should use your network to help colleagues make new connections.<br />Your
					team’s
					effectiveness will increase as you take on the responsibility of helping each person develop their
					skills and expand their network, which in turn increases their own influencing power.<br />Lastly,
					we
					have reputation, which refers to how others perceive you overall.<br />As you might expect, people
					with
					positive reputations tend to be more influential than those with negative reputations.<br />One way
					I’ve
					noticed this play out is through collaboration.<br />If you’re a good collaborator, you can boost
					your
					reputation by becoming known for being easy to work with, keeping your commitments, and helping
					others
					achieve their own goals.<br />Your role– access to and control of information, network, and
					reputation–
					are important organizational sources of power to be aware of.<br />It’s also important to identify
					power
					sources that come from you.<br />These are referred to as personal sources of power, which include
					knowledge, expressiveness, history, and character.<br />I like to think of these as your own
					personal
					superpowers.<br />Knowledge refers to the power that you draw from your expertise in certain
					subjects,
					your unique abilities and skill sets, and even your ability to learn new things.<br />What comes to
					mind
					when you think about an influential leader?<br />Typically, they have a lot of knowledge in their
					field
					and you’re more likely to trust their opinion.<br />When you’re considering how to use your own
					knowledge as a source of power, reflect on the expertise you already have and consider areas where
					you
					still want to grow and learn more.<br />Expressiveness refers to your ability to communicate with
					others.<br />This is a big one.<br />As you learned earlier, so much of influencing comes down to
					how
					you approach your audience.<br />Maybe you’re a great storyteller or maybe you’re really good at
					connecting emotionally with people.<br />Strong communication skills like these can significantly
					increase your ability to influence others.<br />The next personal source of power is
					history.<br />History refers to the level of personal history there is between yourself and another
					person.<br />Makes sense, right?<br />A strong relationship with the person you hope to influence
					can go
					a long way.<br />As a project manager, you’ll be managing team dynamics and building team
					relationships,
					which can help you build up personal history with the people around you.<br />And finally,
					character.<br />Character refers to other people’s view of the qualities that make you,
					you.<br />Like
					honesty, integrity, kindness, and so much more– character is a huge one.<br />You’ll derive an
					enormous
					amount of power from high estimates of your character.<br />What personal characteristics do you
					value
					within yourself?<br />These are the qualities that have the power to make you a strong, supportive
					leader for the people around you.<br />Knowledge, expressiveness, history, and character are just
					four
					personal sources of power, but it’s important to remember that there’s so much wrapped in each one
					of
					these.<br />There’s trustworthiness, authenticity, wisdom, and on and on.<br />There are so many
					attributes to draw power from.<br />I like to think of these elements as personal
					superpowers.<br />I
					learned early on in my career that my personal superpower is knowledge, specifically my innate
					curiosity.<br />When I started at Google, I didn’t have a background in software engineering, but
					I’m a
					naturally curious person and I’m not afraid to ask questions.<br />When I join a new team, I find
					the
					engineer who seems to have the most knowledge or experience, and I ask them to teach me how
					everything
					works.<br />Most people are genuinely interested in sharing what they know.<br />That initial chat
					usually leads to conversations over lunch, which helps me to build my own knowledge and personal
					history
					with my colleague.<br />And through these conversations, I learn about other teammates to connect
					with,
					which increases my network.<br />As you build your career, try to identify your own
					superpowers.<br />Find the combination of influencing techniques that best suits your particular
					circumstances.<br />It takes practice to polish your skills and lean into various superpowers when
					working with others.<br />But if you invest time in thinking and troubleshooting your influencing
					strategy, it will pay off.<br /></p>
