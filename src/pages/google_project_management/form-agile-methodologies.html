				<p id="1cf468a0-53d4-81d3-9a6a-fd7ee6aa4fa8" class="">SPEAKER: I’ll introduce you to some specific
					methodologies under the Agile umbrella.<br />The most popular of these, by far, is Scrum.<br />In
					this
					video, I’ll briefly recount the origins of Scrum and discuss the basics of Scrum
					methodology.<br />So
					what the heck is Scrum?<br />Well, I’ll tell you, first, that it’s not an acronym.<br />If any of
					you
					have ever played or watched the sport of rugby, you may recognize the term.<br />For those that
					aren’t
					familiar with rugby, it’s similar to American football, a full-contact sport played on a field with
					a
					similar-shaped ball.<br />“Scrum” refers to a formation in rugby where all of the players on the
					team
					lean forward, lock their heads together, and then work as one unit to try and gain precious yards
					towards the scoring line.<br />The originators of the Scrum methodology saw their team as a
					heads-down
					group, working very closely together to get that ball down the field, just like scrum in a rugby
					match.<br />So how does the Scrum methodology work as a project-management methodology?<br />I’ll
					give
					you a brief overview here, and we’ll dive into it more throughout this course.<br />If you work in
					Agile
					project management, it’s highly likely that you’ll use Scrum or an approach that is based on
					Scrum.<br />In the 2019 State of Agile report, 72% of teams using Agile methods were using Scrum or
					a
					hybrid.<br />When you use Scrum for project management, you form a team that will work together to
					quickly develop and test a deliverable.<br />The work is completed in short cycles, and the team
					meets
					daily to discuss current tasks and clear up anything that’s blocking their progress.<br />First,
					let’s
					review some terms and concepts specific to Scrum.<br />The backlog is the central artifact in Scrum,
					where all possible ideas, deliverables, features, or tasks are captured for the team to work
					on.<br />It’s prioritized and proactively managed by the team continuously throughout the life of
					the
					project.<br />The “sprint” is the name of the timebox period in Scrum where work is done.<br />The
					sprint can be between one and four weeks long, but most sprints are around two weeks.<br />This is
					often
					called the iteration.<br />And then there’s a practice called the daily scrum, also called the
					stand-up.<br />This is where the team meets for 15 minutes or less, every day of the sprint, to
					inspect
					their progress toward their goal.<br />Next are the roles, the first of which is the scrum
					master.<br />This role is responsible for ensuring that the team lives Agile values and principles,
					follows the processes and practices that the team agreed to, sharing information to the larger
					project
					team, and they also help the team focus on doing their best work.<br />The other notable role in
					Scrum
					is the product owner, who is responsible for maximizing the value of the product and the work of the
					team.<br />The product owner owns the inventory of work and has the final say on how to prioritize
					the
					work.<br />And the development team is responsible for how a team will deliver that
					product.<br />Scrum
					is popular for many reasons.<br />First, it has clear roles and responsibilities for the folks on
					the
					team while continuously emphasizing the power of the team as a whole.<br />Scrum has a very regular
					and
					predictable meeting and delivery schedule with predefined agendas and outcomes for the meetings,
					making
					it easy to teach new team members.<br />It supports and reinforces the Agile values and principles
					while
					adding some structure and foundations that help new Agile teams get started and more experienced
					teams
					get better.<br />And it’s all free and open for all to use.<br />Since it’s the most commonly used
					Agile
					delivery framework, there’s also a huge amount of guidance and support online, as well as
					Scrum-specific
					training and certifications.<br />Scrum lends itself best to the following types of projects and
					teams.<br />Ideally, a Scrum team should be cross-functional, with around three to nine team
					members.<br />Some call this a pizza-sized team because it has the same amount of people who could
					share
					a large pizza.<br />If the team is too small, you might not have the diversity of skills to get work
					done.<br />If the team is too large, it gets hard to distribute information.<br />Lastly, Scrum
					works
					best for projects where the team and management are open-minded, adaptable, and value continuously
					learning how to be a better team.<br />Trying to force a team to do Scrum will almost always
					fail.<br />Note that, in all of these examples, I never once mentioned the word “software.” Although
					Scrum emerged from software projects, people have adapted Scrum to suit all kinds of projects, from
					wedding planning to house moves to building rockets.<br />Popular Agile methodologies that are still
					around from the ’90s, when Agile was invented.<br />These methodologies share Agile values and
					principles, but have very specific practices and applications.<br />One of my personal favorites is
					Kanban.<br />This is a methodology that can be applied in a very simple way, or it can be used to
					drive
					the entire project.<br />The Kanban name comes from two Japanese words– “kan,” meaning “sign,” and
					“ban,” meaning “board.” You may have already used a Kanban board because it’s the most famous
					feature
					adopted by the majority of Agile enthusiasts.<br />The reason Kanban is so popular is that it
					provides
					transparent visual feedback to everyone who might be interested about the status of work in
					progress.<br />Kanban boards, or charts, display the progress of a project as “to do,” “in
					progress,”
					and “done.” Also, just so you know, there are software tools that create digital Kanban boards for
					you.<br />The Kanban method ensures that the project team only accepts a sustainable amount of
					in-progress work.<br />This means the amount of in-progress tasks are limited to what the team can
					actually handle during a certain amount of time.<br />This is called the Work In Progress limit, or
					WIP
					limit.<br />The WIP limit is decided on by the team.<br />This is a reflection of Agile in that
					teams
					are both self-organizing and empowered, and they’re operating at a sustainable pace.<br />The team
					members add new tasks to be completed only after they’ve finished their previous task and are below
					the
					WIP limit.<br />This approach means that once a task has started to be worked on, it becomes a
					priority
					for the whole team to get it done.<br />By focusing on less work, the work gets done
					faster.<br />This
					goal of trying to maximize efficiency is called flow and is a core principle of Kanban.<br />Another
					Agile methodology is Extreme Programming, or XP.<br />It was named that because it took traditional
					software-development activities to an extreme level.<br />But I also believe it’s because it emerged
					at
					the same time as extreme sports, like snowboarding.<br />XP is another one of my personal
					favorites.<br />It was the first Agile methodology I was introduced to back in my days working on
					some
					of the original cell phones at Qualcomm, the company behind the radio technology we all use in our
					phones today.<br />Since XP came out of the software industry, it refers to specific software terms
					and
					activities, like coding and programming.<br />But the XP method can be used in lots of nonsoftware
					environments as well.<br />The XP methodology aims to improve product quality and the ability to
					respond
					to changing customer needs.<br />It does this by taking best practices for the development process
					to
					extreme levels.<br />For example, one best practice is the idea of test-first development.<br />This
					means testing out parts of the product before building them in full.<br />Often, only the larger
					features get tested, which is still good but means some details might get missed.<br />XP takes this
					practice to the extreme by finding ways to test more and smaller features of the product to get even
					more feedback.<br />There are four basic activities that are performed during the product
					development
					process that the XP method tries to enhance.<br />Designing– in software development, this is where
					you
					write a design document describing the parts of the code or instructions for the product and how it
					will
					function.<br />In nonsoftware environments, this would be describing the various pieces and parts
					for
					whatever it is you’re trying to deliver.<br />For example, if you’re delivering an ad campaign,
					maybe
					the main pieces are the artwork, the copy, and the ad-buy plan.<br />XP wants to ensure that all of
					the
					pieces of the product will fit together properly, so it stresses simplicity.<br />Start with a
					simple
					design to meet the most basic and important requirements.<br />Simple designs also take less time to
					complete.<br />Once the basic model is designed and has been tested, then you can think about adding
					on
					other features.<br />Coding– code is a language that’s used to write software programs.<br />It’s
					the
					instructions that tell the computer what to do.<br />In software development, writing clear code is
					crucial, just like clear writing is crucial in any situation where you want to be
					understood.<br />XP
					demands clear and concise code so that others can easily read and understand the program.<br />This
					makes it easier to troubleshoot problems and come up with solutions.<br />In nonsoftware
					environments,
					code would be similar to writing clear and concise processes or instructions for how to build or use
					your product.<br />Testing, like I described earlier, means checking the product for flaws so they
					don’t
					end up in the final product.<br />In XP, more is better.<br />So if a little bit of testing can
					eliminate a few flaws, lots of testing will eliminate even more.<br />The goal is to test for and
					eliminate any flaws in a feature before building it and continuing on.<br />Testing also means
					checking
					to make sure the product features meet the customer’s requirements, which leads us to listening,
					which
					is about listening to the customer and ensuring that the requirements are integrated into the
					product.<br />This relates to Agile in the way that it values customer collaboration, frequent
					communication, and regular feedback.<br />XP features some other innovative practices that are used
					across many Agile teams, regardless of the specific methodology being used.<br />First, there’s pair
					programming, which is when two team members work together at the same time on one
					task.<br />Usually,
					this is done in the same physical location, but with the use of digital-collaboration tools, this
					can
					happen remotely, too.<br />Another practice is continuous integration and continuous
					refactoring.<br />This is the practice of merging product changes into a shared version several
					times a
					day in order to get quick feedback on the quality of the code or product.<br />Then there’s “avoid
					big
					design up front.” This relates to designing and means the design should be just enough to get
					started
					and should be continuously improved as the product evolves.<br />And finally, there’s “write tests,
					not
					requirements.” This means that, instead of writing a product-requirements document and then later
					writing a test plan, your test plan can serve two purposes by, A, telling the team what to build,
					and B,
					comparing what they built to what was supposed to be built.<br />OK, so we’ve got Scrum, Kanban, and
					XP.<br />Let’s explore one more.<br />For those of you who took the earlier courses in this program,
					you
					already learned a little bit about this final methodology, called Lean, in the context of lean six
					sigma.<br />Lean methodology consists of five principles that serve as a recipe for improving
					project
					outcomes.<br />They are “define value,” “map value stream,” “create flow,” “establish pull,” and
					“pursue
					perfection.” Let’s break these down.<br />“Define value” means identifying and focusing on what the
					customer wants and including the customer in the process.<br />A product’s value is the sum of all
					the
					things the customer wants.<br />“Map value stream” means mapping out the process, or stream,
					including
					all the steps involved in producing value for the customer.<br />It also means challenging any steps
					that can be considered wasteful or unnecessary.<br />“Create flow” means ensuring the product flows
					through the value stream efficiently, continuing to eliminate waste throughout the cycle.<br />Work
					to
					remove interruptions, delays, and barriers to the work stream.<br />“Establish pull”– think of
					asking
					someone to pull something off the shelf.<br />You want to make sure the customer is pulling on the
					product or asking for it throughout the value stream.<br />They might pull, or ask for features and
					incremental deliveries.<br />The idea is to make your process as smooth as possible so that the
					customer
					can pull on the product at any time, and you’ll be able to present what you’ve been working on or
					add a
					feature request.<br />Finally, there’s “pursue perfection.” This means pushing your team to
					continuously
					improve the first four process steps.<br />So how does this relate to Agile?<br />Well, Agile
					emerged
					after Lean, and the inventors of Agile were inspired to apply Lean manufacturing principles to
					software
					development.<br />Like Agile, Lean is a set of principles and a value system.<br />Many of the
					differences are really just in the wording.<br /></p>
