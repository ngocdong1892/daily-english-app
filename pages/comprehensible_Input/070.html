					successful man so I can help everybody else around me okay that's my mission and I'm reading and
					learning so many awesome things that I want to share them with you guys so that you guys can can
					start to do these things in your lives too because money is not everything no esto but it is it
					makes your life a lot easier okay so this book The Millionaire Next Door two men wrote this book
					okay two authors they wrote this book and the point of this book they were studying millionaires
					okay they wanted to know why are some people very successful and have a lot of money and why do some
					people have none so they wanted they wanted to study millionaires the first thing they had to do was
					find millionaires okay buscar million they had to find they had to search to search and find
					millionaires so where do you look where do you look they looked in fancy neighborhoods okay uh
					neighborhood is okay they looked at neighborhoods where people with big houses nice cars okay
					doctors and lawyers lived there they looked in nice neighborhoods but but what they found out was
					pretty interesting okay they found out that the people in those nice neighborhoods who have nice
					cars big houses okay nice clothes expensive watches all right they found out that those people they
					are not as rich as we think okay they're not as rich as we think and the people who actually have
					money who have a lot of money saved up they live in normal neighborhoods okay with normal people
					They Drive old they drive older cars okay pretty interesting it's pretty interesting because we
					people humans we think we think that when we see somebody who has a nice car okay they have a nice
					watch Big House nice shoes nice clothes we think that person has a lot of money wow that person's
					rich but the truth that the offers found out in this book The Truth is that those people they spend
					Gaston more than they earn okay oh wow it's pretty crazy Ghana and yeah they earn a lot of money
					Mucho Dinero because they're lawyers avogados doctors okay they make a lot of money but the problem
					is they spend even more okay they spend more because they are showing off okay mostrandosas and a
					lot of them use credit cards okay they're spending money that they do not even have okay so next
					time that you see somebody in an awesome car nice watch and you're thinking man that guy's got so
					much money I wish I had that the truth is that that person probably does not have as much money as
					you think they do so what what are the things that actually make people wealthy wealthy is another
					word for rich or Rico okay so what things actually make people wealthy well the authors they found
					out that there are seven things seven things that the average millionaire has in common one they
					live below their means what does it mean to live below your means to live below your means means
					that you you spend gastas a lot less than you earn okay so it means that you're saving our Rando
					okay you do not spend all of your money that you make number two they only use their time energy and
					money in ways that can make them more money okay these wealthy people do not spend their money on
					fancy cars fancy houses all of this stuff they spend their money on a good education okay education
					for their kids they spend a lot of money a lot of money on books learning taking courses okay things
					that will make them smarter so they can learn new ways to make more money they spend money on Expert
					advice conceros de expertos for example tax attorneys okay or somebody who can help them invest in
					virtir number three they believe crayon they believe that to build wealth or recessa to build wealth
					is more important than to show off what you have now for those of you who do not know what showing
					off means showing off means that's showing off okay if I have an awesome car and I'm like yeah look
					at me look at me I got money that's showing off okay and the people who are really wealthy they do
					not worry about that they think about saving money number four their parents sus Padres did not give
					them money okay A lot of times we think oh that person's rich I bet his dad gave him that okay I bet
					his Grandpa gave him that money but the fact is more than 90 percent noventa porciento of all
					millionaires in the U.S are self-made okay that means they made themselves Rich their parents did
					not have money they were not rich these people became Rich by making a business by working hard by
					saving their money and by not spending it on dumb stuff number five these people do not give their
					kids they do not give them money okay they do not say here take all this money no what they do is
					they teach they teach their kids how to make their own money and how to be independent a lot of
					times these people they will pay for their children's education they do not give them money
					effectivo no they pay for their education and teach them how to make their own money so they can
					live the rest of their lives successfully number six number six they are great at finding
					opportunities to save money or to invest their money and number seven number seven they picked the
					right job the right career okay now this one this one's pretty important okay ah it's kind of a sad
					situation that we have especially here in the U.S sometimes kids will go to college and spend a lot
					of money for a degree but they go for a job that doesn't make any money okay they go for philosophy
					or theater okay something like that and that's great it's great to know these things it's great to
					learn about art culture okay I I love all this stuff the problem is it is not it is not a good
					investment spend eighty thousand dollars okay for a degree that will only allow you to earn Thirty
					thirty thousand dollars a year okay that's a terrible investment so these people these self-made
					millionaires they picked good jobs okay and then they saved their money they picked good solid
					careers and then they save their money for many years so what did the authors discover when they
					studied all of these people they discovered that the real way to build wealth rickessa is with
					discipline sacrifice and hard work there's no secret Secreto to make you rich quick okay those
					things do not last the secret is to work hard be disciplined and make sacrifices for your future now
					I want to share some other facts from this book about the wealthy people here in the U.S 90 of the
					self-made millionaires did not have wealthy parents the majority of millionaire families are a
					traditional family meaning that there's a man and a woman married with kids and of those families
					more than 50 cincuenta more than 50 percent of the women do not work jobs they stay home and take
					care of the kids they save 15 percent Quince por siento of their income of the money that they earn
					and this next part is crazy okay it's crazy they have enough money saved and invested that they
					could live comfortably for 10 years without working yep it's Gucci Mane Miss Amigos if I do not go
					to work for 10 days I'm in trouble guys I'm in trouble all right I do not know about you guys but I
					could not stop working and still be okay but these people they can because they have been saving and
					they are very cheap okay they're very cheap so if you say if you say that a thing is cheap it means
					barato okay but if you say that a person is cheap oh he's cheap man you're so cheap it means that
					that person does not like to spend their money okay that's a person who's cheap so I am trying to be
					more cheap so my friends when I read a book and I learn something from it that I think is useful
					util I try to start putting that into my life okay I start using these things that I learn in my
					life and start making changes okay I try to change my habits so a couple things that I have changed
					in the last couple weeks after reading this book that have really helped me out I've already saved a
					lot of money the first thing I stopped I stopped drinking coffee Google Cafe from Dunkin Donuts okay
					every day I would go to Dunkin Donuts and buy a coffee and it was like five dollars okay now five
					dollars oh that's not bad don't be cheap Kyle okay I understand five dollars is not much five
					dollars today tomorrow the day after okay that's a lot of money at the end of the year that's a lot
					of money and the second thing that I've changed is how I eat okay I used to go to the store Tienda
					to the store and look for things that look like they taste good okay I'd buy a steak okay if you
					stick and they're expensive but it's just one meal okay so I eat the steak and that's it fifteen
					dollars gone now I look at the prices I look at the prices and I see what I could buy for a little
					bit of money and a lot of food okay so I'll buy a big big box of eggs whales yesterday I bought uh
					30 eggs trentawayos for I think it was uh nine dollars okay but I'm gonna eat that or that's gonna
					last me a week okay and I buy a bunch of ground beef which is a lot cheaper than steak it does not
					taste as good but it's less money and also I'm getting healthier because I'm eating less and I'm
					eating better food it's helping me to be strong in the gym okay and get in better shape Mass feet
					it's all my friends to read this book was very interesting for me and I'm happy I did it I'm happy
					that I started making these changes in my life and I hope that in the next few years after making
					these changes I'll be in a good position to help the people I love to be very generous with my time
					and my money okay I do not want to get a bunch of money and keep it all to myself no I want to have
					enough money to help my mom my family my son okay so I learned a lot from this book I hope you guys
					learned a little bit from this video some good English maybe some tips that could help you in your
					life okay
