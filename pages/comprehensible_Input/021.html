					Are you ready to learn some real life English with comprehensible input? Well, good, because today
					we are going to explore some Chinese culture without leaving the United States. We're going to
					explore Chinatown. Let's go. Hello guys, it is your English speaking friend Kyle and today we're
					going to improve our English with comprehensible input..<br>
					What is comprehensible input?.<br>
					Comprehensible input is when a native speaker like me speaks slowly and clearly so that you can
					understand. Now, I have a question. Did you guys know that there are places in the United States
					that feel like other countries?.<br>
					Well, today we're going to explore one of those places. Today, we're in Chinatown. So, let's see
					what we can find here in Chinatown. Okay, guys. So, what is a place like this even doing in the
					United States? What is it doing here in Chicago? Well, in the 1800s, many Chinese immigrants came to
					the United States, mostly in California, for the gold rush while everybody was trying to find gold.
					Later, they worked on the transcontinental rail road, which is the railroad that stretched all the
					way across the United States. After the railroad was done in California, the Chinese immigrants were
					facing a lot of racism. They couldn't get jobs. They felt like they were excluded from life here in
					the US. And in fact, there were even laws. There were even laws preventing them from getting good
					jobs..<br>
					That's pretty messed up. Some of them came here to the Midwest where they found work in restaurants,
					and small businesses. Over time, the community became very tight-knit, and more people kept coming,
					more immigrants kept coming here. By 1912, Chinatown was born. All right, guys. We are in Chinatown
					and we are going to try some authentic Chinese dumplings and this Chinese appetizer. This is called
					brazed beef and is served cold which is pretty strange for here but let's give it a shot.
					>> Has a very good flavor..<br>
					>> See this is a tea beverage..<br>
					All right. So, we've got our steamed dumplings. They come in this little container. Hot water goes
					under there, and that's how it cooks. These have pork in them, and this is the way to eat it.
					You take some of this chili oil, spicy, and some soy sauce, and some vinegar.
					Now, we try it. My wife loves these..<br>
					So, the best thing about these, these are called soup dumplings. There's like a broth. There's a
					juice inside of them..<br>
					When you bite it, you get the meat, but also that liquid that that soup. Oh, it's so good.
					Delicious. All right. Now, we've got the fried dumplings with the beef. You can see that these are
					crispier. They were fried in a pan. Oh, looks so good. Let's try these. These ones have beef and
					onion in them..<br>
					The texture of them is great. That crunchiness. This part right here is crispy and crunchy when you
					bite it. And there's still a soup inside that juicy, delicious broth.
					Super good..<br>
					All right, guys. That was absolutely delicious. Me and my wife ate like 30 dumplings. Now, we're
					going to see if we can go find some good dessert in Chinatown. So, guys, today today, modern day,
					Chinatown is a very popular tourist destination. So, you'll see a lot of people who are not Chinese
					here, but it is still a place where a lot of Chinese people actually live their lives. And as you
					can see, the signs are bilingual..<br>
					You've got written in English for the tourists and written in I assume that's Mandarin, but I know
					there are some people here who speak Cantonese from Hong Kong as well.
					All right, guys. We found our dessert. And interesting, we're at a French bakery in Chinatown.
					Means every day in French. So, we're going to try some French pastries. We got a chocolate croissant
					here, which looks delicious. And this is some sort of melon flavored pastry with cream in it. So,
					let's see..<br>
					Oh, it has a very soft texture. Very interesting the texture..<br>
					>> Here you go, camera..<br>
					>> My poor camera wife. She wanted to try this and now she has to wait for me to eat.
					>> I love the texture. Okay guys, now let's try our chocolatecovered croissants.
					 camera wife is jealous and she wants her bite..<br>
					>> All right, guys. We're going to eat our dessert. And we'll see you in a minute.
					All right, guys. So, something else cool that they have here are these statues.
					They have 12 of them. They have 12 of them, and what they represent are the animals that are part of
					the Chinese zodiac. So, the Chinese zodiac is a 12 year cycle. It repeats every 12 years and it's
					based on the lunar or the moon calendar. It plays a big part in Chinese culture, especially during
					the lunar new year. Each person is born under one of these animals depending on the year that they
					were born. And I was born in the year 1991. Therefore, and according to the Chinese zodiac, my
					animal is the ram. Some people believe that your animal influences your personality and even the
					other people that you are compatible with. And during the zodiac year of your animal, a lot of
					people wear red for good luck. And my lovely camera wife was born in the year 1996.
					So she is a rat..<br>
					Even the Starbucks here, guys, a Starbucks, a very American company, has the Chinese symbols on the
					sign..<br>
					Found a whole another street to explore, guys. Let's check it out. Who's this?
					>> All right, guys. Here's something interesting. Mother Teresa. This is Chinese Catholic Church. I
					didn't know that that was a thing, but here we have one. And it's actually a really beautiful
					building and a very cute cat..<br>
					One thing I was not expecting to see in Chinatown. Jesus. Interesting.
					All right, guys. This is the Welcome to Chinatown..<br>
					I don't even know what you would call this. Some sort of presentation, but it's beautiful.
					Beautifully made. So, while we're here, let's learn some interesting facts about China. First
					interesting fact about China, Chinese people love to eat pork. As a matter of fact, half of all of
					the pigs in the whole world are in China. Next interesting fact, Mandarin Chinese is the language
					that is spoken as a first language by more people than any other language in the whole world.
					Another fact here in the United States, I do not know about where you are, but when a woman gets
					married, she wears white. In China, they often wear red for good luck. Something interesting that I
					would love to try. In the city of Beijing, people eat as a snack scorpions on a stick. I would be
					interested to try that snack. Chinese people invented many incredible things that we use even to
					this day. Some of the things that the Chinese invented are paper, printing, the compass, and
					gunpowder. Some of those things have really changed the world if you think about it. All right,
					guys. Those are the facts about China..<br>
					Hope you guys had fun coming with the lovely camera wife and myself to check out Chinatown, a little
					taste of Chinese culture here in the US. Thank you all very much for spending your time with me
					learning English here. See you all in the next video.
