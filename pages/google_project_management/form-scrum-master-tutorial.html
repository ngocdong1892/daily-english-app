					introduced you to lots of project management artifacts, such as project plans, statements of work,
					RACI
					charts, and more.<br />Now we’ll review an important artifact of the Scrum framework, the product
					backlog.<br />In an earlier video, we defined the product backlog as the single authoritative source
					for
					things that a team works on.<br />It contains all of the features, requirements, and activities
					associated with deliverables to achieve the goal of the project.<br />The traditional non-Agile
					project
					management equivalent would be the set of project requirements.<br />There are three key features of
					a
					product backlog.<br />First, the product backlog is a living artifact, meaning that items are added
					to
					the backlog at any time.<br />The product backlog evolves throughout the whole lifecycle of the
					project
					and serves as a central guide for the team to know what to work on next.<br />Second, the product
					backlog is owned and adjusted by the product owner.<br />And finally, the product backlog is always
					a
					prioritized list of features.<br />So when there’s new information or new features, those are added
					to
					the backlog in order of importance.<br />The items at the very top of the list are very specific and
					well defined, leaving the more vague items for the bottom of the list.<br />Remember, the product
					backlog is the guide and roadmap of your product.<br />It’s the central artifact in Scrum, where all
					possible ideas, deliverables, features, or tasks are captured for the team to work on.<br />Because
					the
					backlog is so central, there are a few best practices and pieces of data to capture when working
					with
					product backlogs.<br />There’s the description, the value, the order, and the estimate.<br />Let’s
					go
					through how to build a sample backlog with these best practices in mind.<br />First, there’s the
					item
					description.<br />The item description is exactly what it sounds like.<br />It describes an
					item.<br />When you’re writing an item description, it’s a good idea to be really clear when adding
					product backlog items so the details are encouraged.<br />For instance, on Office Green’s new
					project
					Virtual Verde, here’s an example of an item description.<br />As a Virtual Verde client, I plan to
					grow
					my choice of vegetables while I work from home in my New York City apartment.<br />This item
					description
					includes essential details, such as an action and a location from the perspective of the
					customer.<br />This ensures that the development team has enough information to meet the user’s
					needs.<br />Next up, we have the value field.<br />This is the field that tells us how much business
					value the item delivers to the customers, to the team, or to the users.<br />How to indicate value
					is a
					choice the Scrum team should make together.<br />I like to set value by using dollar signs, ranging
					from
					one dollar sign for low value all the way up to four dollar signs for high added business
					value.<br />Next, we have to add in an estimate.<br />An estimate is how much effort the Scrum team
					thinks an item will take to complete.<br />We’ll explore how to do relative effort estimation coming
					up.<br />But for now, it’s important to know that the relative effort estimate is captured in each
					backlog item.<br />This field in the backlog is owned by the development team.<br />The next
					attribute
					of each backlog item is the order.<br />As we mentioned, the backlog should always be
					prioritized.<br />Both the estimate and value fields we just discussed help the product owner figure
					out
					where to place an item in the backlogs order of hierarchy.<br />A product owner may ask themselves,
					how
					important is this backlog item compared to all the other items.<br />Product backlogs order items
					from
					highest to lowest priority.<br />This is called a stacked rank.<br />Ordering items this way allows
					teams to operate more efficiently.<br />For example, our Virtual Verde market research team learned
					that
					people who work from home would much rather have plants that are easy to take care of, versus a more
					high maintenance plant like orchids.<br />Then the team prioritizes the simple and easy plants on
					the
					backlog, like succulents, higher than the orchids.<br />So their product backlog lists one,
					succulents,
					two, orchids.<br />But say, for example, support gets an email from a user who says they’d love to
					have
					bonsai trees, which are also hard to take care of.<br />Where do we put it in the order, before
					orchids
					or after?<br />The product owner does some research and decides that the team will do orchids first
					because they find that many more users have requested orchids versus bonsai trees.<br />The product
					owner gives orchids a two dollar sign value rating, bonsai trees a one dollar sign value rating, and
					puts bonsai trees last on their list.<br />Awesome, let’s move on.<br />When creating backlog items,
					the
					goal is to include as much as you can while not stressing about the unknowns too much.<br />For
					example,
					the product owner in Virtual Verde doesn’t know yet how much bonsai trees cost compared to
					succulents.<br />So they don’t know if they serve a high-end market or a low-end market.<br />They
					document an assumption in the bonsai tree description and move on.<br />They can study that in more
					detail when it is higher on the priority list.<br />So now a bit more about defining the product
					backlog
					and who owns it.<br />We also discussed how the various roles work with a product backlog.<br />And
					we
					can identify and describe each field in a product backlog.<br />Now that about the various fields
					associated with each item in your backlog, let’s discuss a popular way to capture and manage those
					backlog items– user stories.<br />User stories are short, simple descriptions of a feature told from
					the
					perspective of the user.<br />This helps the team create a solution that’s always centered around
					the
					user and the user experience.<br />User stories might start off large and broad, or maybe broken
					down to
					be as small or specific as possible.<br />In this lesson, we’re going to give you some ideas on how
					to
					write user stories and how to break them down.<br />User stories are made up of three different
					elements– the user, the action they will take, and the benefit to them.<br />These elements might
					have a
					few different formats.<br />But the most common is as a user role, I want this action so that I can
					get
					this value.<br />When writing effective user stories, the team must have a user in
					mind.<br />Imagine
					that the user will interact with the product in order to achieve a specific outcome.<br />What I
					really
					like to do at this stage is create personas or detailed descriptions of my different
					users.<br />Sometimes, I even give them names.<br />So in Virtual Verde, we could give our users
					some
					names and some information about them.<br />Here are some user persona ideas.<br />Leo is my plant
					vendor, who manages acquiring the plants, the supply chain, and delivery logistics Felicity is my
					gardening expert, who helps my support team give our customers really excellent advice on how to
					take
					care of their plants.<br />Zach is my amateur vegetable gardener, who wants to use the plants they
					purchased to make dinner.<br />Nia is my management consultant, who works from home and wants to set
					up
					a professional backdrop for video conferences in their home office.<br />Reena is my flower
					aficionado,
					who wants to have a different flower arrangement each week to brighten up their home.<br />By giving
					these users a name and a back story, we can imagine them in our minds.<br />And we will design
					better
					products for them as a result.<br />I really enjoy writing user stories because it puts me in the
					shoes
					of my users.<br />Each user story should meet six different criteria represented by the acronym
					INVEST,
					or invest.<br />I for independent.<br />The story should be able to be started and finished by
					itself.<br />It’s not dependent on another story to finish it.<br />The N stands for
					negotiable.<br />There’s room for negotiation and discussion about this item.<br />The V is for
					valuable.<br />This means that completing the user story has to deliver value.<br />E is for
					estimable.<br />Our definition of done must be clear, so that the team can give each user story an
					estimate.<br />The S is for small.<br />Each user story needs to be able to fit within a planned
					sprint.<br />If that user story is too big, it should be broken down into smaller
					stories.<br />Stories
					that are low priority on the backlog can stay big until they become a priority for an upcoming
					sprint.<br />And finally, the T is testable.<br />A test can be written to check and make sure that
					it
					meets the acceptance criteria.<br />While the product owner is the main person responsible for
					writing
					user stories, the team has a responsibility to give feedback on whether the user story is clear and
					fits
					the invest criteria, before they invest any time into it.<br />In addition to user stories, you need
					to
					know the term epic, which simply represents a group or collection of user stories.<br />Some epics
					for
					Virtual Verde might be live plant delivery, office plant advice service, vendor management, or
					client
					data management.<br />Let’s come up with a sample user story for our Virtual Verde clients in the
					live
					plant delivery epic.<br />As a Virtual Verde client, I would like to acquire a bonsai tree so that I
					can
					have a beautiful plant, and I can meditate as I trim the branches.<br />I thought of this one
					because I
					bought a bonsai tree for my 12-year-old nephew last year.<br />And he did some research and learned
					that
					in Japan, pruning bonsai trees is a meditative practice.<br />So he’s learning how to do
					that.<br />With
					that sample user story, the product owner creates something called the acceptance criteria, which is
					essentially the checklist you will use to decide whether the user story is done.<br />To have a
					completed user story, you must meet the acceptance criteria checklist.<br />Here’s an example of
					acceptance criteria for the bonsai tree user story.<br />User can browse for three different types
					of
					bonsai trees to purchase.<br />Compare the three trees to know which is easiest and hardest to grow
					in
					their home.<br />Maybe each plant has a beginner, intermediate, and advanced gardener notation next
					to
					it.<br />Can purchase specific bonsai tree care packages, like fertilizer, trimming shears, et
					cetera.<br />Access online to a bonsai booklet sheet, as well as having a care booklet packaged with
					the
					tree.<br />Can find a troubleshooting bonsai tree issues page on Virtual Verde’s FAQ
					page.<br />Sounds
					like an amazing story, doesn’t it?<br />It feels like a real thing that a user can interact with and
					get
					excited about.<br />Each user story in the backlog should be written this way.<br />It’s natural for
					items higher in the priority list to have more detail and fewer gray areas.<br />By leaving these
					low
					priority items vague, this saves the team time from working on items that may end up getting
					deprioritized down the road.<br />[MUSIC PLAYING] We’ve been exploring everything there is to know
					about
					a product backlog.<br />Although the product owner owns or is in charge of the data in the backlog,
					the
					team must work together to keep the living document up to date.<br />In this video, we’ll discuss
					how to
					do that through a process called backlog refinement.<br />Backlog refinement refers to the act of
					keeping the backlog described, estimated, and prioritized so that the Scrum team can operate
					effectively.<br />After the product owner has added the backlog items with a description and a value
					statement, they do backlog refinement.<br />Backlog refinement is when the product owner and some or
					all
					of the Scrum team review the backlog to ensure it contains the appropriate items, and that nothing
					new
					is needed or nothing needs to be removed, that the items are prioritized by the product
					owner.<br />This
					is also called setting the order field.<br />That the items at the top of the backlog are ready for
					delivery with clear acceptance criteria, and that the backlog items include estimates, or an
					informed
					assessment about how much work a particular backlog item will be.<br />Let’s discuss estimates since
					they’re crucial in backlog refinement.<br />We add estimates to backlog items to inform our planning
					practices about how much effort it will be to finish each item or user story.<br />Through
					estimation we
					can find out how much work we have ahead of us.<br />It can be difficult to estimate the amount of
					time
					it takes to complete a task.<br />More often than not, we human beings tend to underestimate the
					time
					until completion.<br />When it comes to big projects, this effect can be multiplied many times and
					can
					be the root cause of projects being late and over budget.<br />So in Scrum, we try to overcome this
					problem by practicing relative estimation instead of absolute estimation.<br />Absolute estimation
					is
					also called time and effort estimation in traditional project management.<br />Relative estimation
					means
					that instead of trying to determine exactly how long a task will take, we compare the effort of that
					task to the effort for another task.<br />And that becomes the estimate.<br />That estimation is not
					done in traditional units of hours, days, or weeks.<br />Instead, we assign each backlog item a
					value
					that is a relative unit for size.<br />There are two common relative estimation methods that I find
					most
					useful when estimating user stories.<br />These are t-shirt sizes and story points.<br />Let’s start
					with the simpler of the two, t-shirt sizes.<br />To get started, the team simply picks one item on
					the
					backlog that seems to be about a medium sized workload and simply calls that a medium in the
					estimate
					field.<br />After that, they take another item on the backlog and compare it to the medium item they
					just identified and answer the question, if that first item was a medium, what size would I give
					this
					one?<br />The team will repeat this process on each additional item or user story on the backlog
					until
					they’re all addressed and done.<br />For example, let’s take four items from Virtual Verde’s product
					backlog, adding bonsai trees to the catalog, creating a mobile app, launching a new logo, creating
					the
					new account page.<br />The team decides that launching a new logo is their medium.<br />The team
					together compares the other three items to that medium item, which gives them their relative effort
					estimate.<br />Then, there’s my favorite method for estimating user stories, tasks, and backlog
					items,
					known as story points.<br />Story points are a bit more advanced than t-shirt sizes, but the concept
					is
					similar.<br />The first step is the same.<br />The team picks an item as their anchor item.<br />And
					they’ll conduct their estimations relative to that item.<br />Instead of using t-shirt sizes, this
					process uses what are called story points.<br />Most teams use a famous mathematical sequence of
					numbers
					called the Fibonacci sequence.<br />The Fibonacci sequence is 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, and continues
					on to
					infinity.<br />These numbers are special in that they start out close to one another.<br />But as
					the
					numbers get higher, they spread farther and farther out.<br />This is helpful because as the
					estimate
					gets higher, the uncertainty and risk also gets higher.<br />This number combines both effort and
					risk
					into one number.<br />In other words, there’s not much use in debating estimation values between 21
					and
					25 points.<br />But choosing between 21 and 34 is a real conversation.<br />This concept can be
					tricky
					at first, and practice is the best way to learn it.<br />To explain this concept in the classes that
					I
					teach at Google, we use this example.<br />Let’s say you want to measure the effort to completely
					consume different kinds of fruit.<br />You have in front of you an orange, a strawberry, a banana, a
					mango, a pineapple, and a cherry.<br />What are the factors that go into that estimate?<br />Are
					there
					seeds to deal with?<br />Do I need to eat it with a napkin?<br />Can I eat it in one bite?<br />Do I
					have to peel it, or do I need any tools to prepare it?<br />OK, let’s try it.<br />If I choose a
					mango
					as our starting fruit at 5 points, how might you estimate the rest?<br />I would rate them this way–
					orange, 3 because the peel is easier than cutting a mango.<br />Strawberry, 1 because I don’t mind
					eating stems, low effort.<br />Banana, 3 because I have to peel it, similar to
					oranges.<br />Pineapple,
					13, it’s giant.<br />I can’t eat it in one sitting.<br />And cherry, 2– stems, seeds, you know what
					I
					mean.<br />It’s really fun to learn how differently people have learned how to cut up a
					pineapple.<br />But more importantly, what estimation exercises do for a team is uncover great ideas
					on
					how to get something done, as well as surfacing where the riskiest parts of the project
					are.<br />Why do
					I like story points better than t-shirt sizes?<br />Let’s apply them to our Virtual Verde
					backlog.<br />Now we can see that adding a new user and adding bonsai trees to our catalog aren’t
					quite
					the same size, which the t-shirt sizes might have implied.<br />Using story points, a new user is 8
					points.<br />And the bonsai trees are 13.<br />Why would I mark them this way?<br />Well,
					implementing a
					new user page is a simple software update.<br />Adding bonsai trees is more than just
					software.<br />It
					includes finding vendors, building a supply chain, and more.<br />I mentioned earlier that backlog
					refinement, which includes adding estimates and updating the order field, should take place
					regularly.<br />Just as it’s up to the team to choose which estimation method they select, it’s up
					to
					the team to decide when and how often to conduct backlog refinement.<br />Some teams prefer to set
					up
					special meetings just to refine the backlog.<br />Others will simply refine the backlog continuously
					in
					conversations or emails.<br />And finally, some teams will conduct backlog refinement as part of a
					scheduled event, like their sprint planning meeting.<br />Now you know how to define backlog
					refinement.<br />And you can explain relative effort estimation, t-shirt sizes, and story
					points.<br />In the next video, we’re going to learn more about sprint planning.<br />Meet you
					there.<br />[MUSIC PLAYING] As you learned earlier, sprints, which we also called iterations,
					provide
					the whole rhythm for the team and is one of the five Scrum events.<br />They allow us to get
					feedback
					quicker, encourage team collaboration, and provide more focus for Scrum teams.<br />Within a sprint,
					the
					amount of work is planned based on the historical capacity of the team and is made ready for the
					sprint
					planning event.<br />It might help to think of each sprint as a mini project with planning,
					execution,
					delivery, closing, and a retrospective all wrapped into this bite-sized package.<br />Sprints are so
					important to Scrum, that the other four Scrum events revolve around the sprint.<br />The Scrum guide
					technically defines five events, the sprint itself, sprint planning, daily Scrum, sprint review, and
					the
					sprint retrospective.<br />Throughout this section of videos, I’ll share what the recommended
					duration,
					or timebox, is for each of these events.<br />Timeboxes are an important concept in Scrum.<br />Some
					examples of benefits are that they create a sense of urgency, which will drive prioritization,
					provide a
					window of focus, which improves productivity, and they help the team develop a predictable rhythm to
					their work.<br />A sprint’s timebox can range anywhere from one to four weeks.<br />How do you
					choose?<br />Well, there are three considerations.<br />First, think about what you expect the
					frequency
					of changes to be.<br />How often do you think your requirements might change?<br />If you expect
					your
					project to have new requests popping up each week, you may want to make your sprint length one week,
					so
					that you can adapt more often.<br />If the needs are more stable, perhaps longer will be just
					fine.<br />Second, think about how much focus time your solution developers might need to build a
					backlog item.<br />If the baseline effort for most of your activities requires at least a week to
					create
					something valuable, then your sprint length should be at least two weeks to give the team room to
					execute without feeling the crunch mode.<br />Third, think about how much overhead goes into a
					delivery
					of your product.<br />If your deliverable or solution requires a large review with many
					stakeholders, or
					goes through a rigorous testing and quality assurance process that takes several days, you should
					factor
					that into your sprint length and choose a longer sprint, such as three or four weeks
					instead.<br />Like
					most things in Scrum, there’s no one-size-fits-all.<br />And if you set a sprint length and decide
					it’s
					too long or too short after a few sprints, you can always change it.<br />For example, my current
					team
					has sprints that are one week long because we expect a lot of change and new requests coming into
					our
					backlog every week.<br />But often, our work takes longer than a week to complete.<br />We’re
					currently
					reflecting on that contradiction and considering changing our sprint length to two
					weeks.<br />Great.<br />Now you know more about defining the sprint.<br />[MUSIC PLAYING] For sprint
					planning, the entire Scrum team comes together and meets to confirm how much capacity, meaning time
					and
					people, are available during this sprint.<br />And then they identify what items from the backlog
					will
					be done during the sprint.<br />This becomes the sprint backlog, and ultimately, the sprint
					goal.<br />This is a time for the Scrum master to facilitate team communication and answer the
					following
					questions throughout the event.<br />Who is available during this sprint?<br />Are there any
					vacations
					or conflicts that we should know about?<br />What has been our average velocity, meaning how many
					points
					or backlog items have we been able to complete in a single sprint in the past?<br />What can and
					should
					be accomplished by the team in this upcoming sprint?<br />What is the ultimate sprint goal?<br />How
					will the work get done?<br />Throughout this sprint, who is responsible for what tasks?<br />We’ve
					discussed sprint lengths and story sizes.<br />So let’s explore the meaning of definition of
					done.<br />Definition of done refers to an agreed upon set of items that must be completed before a
					user
					story or backlog item can be considered complete.<br />Some things that may be within your
					definition of
					done are the code or solution itself is reviewed by an independent peer group.<br />The product or
					unit
					passes all testing requirements, which could include security or performance
					testing.<br />Documentation
					is completed.<br />All user story acceptance criteria, specified by the product owner, is
					met.<br />And
					finally, the product owner accepts the user story.<br />This list isn’t comprehensive.<br />And the
					team
					should determine what should be on this list and improve it as needed.<br />A key deliverable of the
					sprint planning event is the sprint backlog.<br />The sprint backlog is the set of product backlog
					items
					that are identified for completion during the upcoming sprint.<br />In other words, the sprint
					backlog
					is a subset of items from the product backlog that you’ll aim to finish during that particular
					sprint.<br />For example, Virtual Verde’s product backlog might have 50 backlog items.<br />And
					Virtual
					Verde has created four week sprints that are named by month– May sprint, June sprint, July sprint,
					and
					so on.<br />For the May sprint, the team has determined that they can complete the top five of those
					items, based on the capacity of the team for May and the size of the effort of those
					items.<br />Those
					five items now make up the sprint backlog.<br />The sprint goal is the overarching objective that
					the
					team aims to achieve and helps the team understand the why of the sprint.<br />This should be taken
					from
					a big picture view of the items on the sprint backlog.<br />The benefit of having a bigger sprint
					goal
					identified is that it helps the team focus on a broader team objective, rather than putting them
					into
					separate workstreams.<br />For example, let’s say Virtual Verde has identified these five items as
					the
					sprint backlog for May.<br />Virtual Verde users can purchase bonsai trees.<br />Virtual Verde users
					can
					access an online discussion forum about home office decor.<br />Virtual Verde vendor management team
					can
					add audit results for vendors.<br />Virtual Verde users can use a coupon to purchase home office
					accessories.<br />Virtual Verde customer support can connect products to support tickets.<br />So
					the
					sprint goal is to provide a comprehensive experience to the user who wishes to install a bonsai tree
					in
					their home office.<br />All of these backlog items can be connected to this sprint goal in some
					way.<br />For example, there is a new coupon for bonsais.<br />The vendors are audited for bonsai
					tree
					quality and so on.<br />[MUSIC PLAYING] As a refresher, one of the principles from the Agile
					Manifesto
					states, “the most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a
					development
					team is face-to-face conversation.” So in this video, we’ll discuss communicating with the team
					through
					two kinds of face-to-face events that occur during and after the sprint, the daily Scrum, and the
					sprint
					review.<br />First, the daily Scrum, which is sometimes referred to as stand-up, is a time for the
					Scrum
					team to synchronize and prioritize activities for the day.<br />In 15 minutes, and at the same time
					and
					place every day, each team member answers the following questions.<br />What did I do yesterday that
					helped the development team meet the sprint goal?<br />What will I do today to help the development
					team
					meet the sprint goal?<br />Do I notice any impediment that prevents me or the development team from
					meeting our goals?<br />Daily stand-ups should provide the Scrum master with the opportunity to
					quickly
					unblock the team with little delay.<br />And daily stand-ups are an opportunity to reinforce focus
					on
					the sprint backlog and sprint goal.<br />The official Scrum guide says that daily stand ups must
					happen
					every single day.<br />Though I will say, I have had successful Scrum teams who meet less frequently
					than that.<br />My current Scrum team has a one week sprint.<br />And we have stand ups two days
					during
					the week.<br />We found that this works really well for us.<br />Try it out, and see what works best
					for
					your team.<br />At the closing of a sprint, the team will complete another event, known as the
					sprint
					review.<br />This sprint event is crucial to the Scrum pillars of inspection, and adaptation, and
					demonstrate the values of openness, courage, and respect.<br />Let’s discuss what I mean by
					that.<br />The sprint review is a meeting with the entire Scrum team where the product is
					demonstrated
					in order to determine which aspects are finished and which aren’t.<br />During a sprint review, the
					development team and product owner will play a heavy role in this inspection and
					discussion.<br />They’ll also cover an exploration of which items should be considered done in the
					product backlog.<br />And they’ll demonstrate and inspect the product.<br />Sprint reviews should be
					really fun and uplifting.<br />The sprint review is when the team gets to impress each other with
					the
					cool things they’ve accomplished over the last one to four weeks.<br />These timeboxed meetings
					should
					not exceed four hours.<br />And they’re a good opportunity for the team to practice the Scrum values
					of
					openness and respect as they give feedback about the completed work.<br />Often, some of the
					greatest
					product ideas come out of the sprint review.<br />Let’s look at an example.<br />With the new
					service,
					the Virtual Verde team needs to launch their new website page featuring home office
					plants.<br />Let’s
					imagine that the Scrum team has a marketing specialist on the team.<br />Remember, Scrum teams are
					cross
					functional.<br />During the August sprint review meeting, one of the sprint backlog items was to
					create
					a launch email to send out to their existing plant pals corporate customers about their brand new
					adventure.<br />During the sprint review meeting, the team gets a demo of the email.<br />They pull
					up
					the email onto the shared screen and give the specialist feedback right there in the meeting, such
					as
					love that opening line– really draws them in.<br />Let’s make the opening image bigger.<br />Can we
					make
					it easier for the recipient to forward this to their friends?<br />Can we make this text
					shorter?<br />It’s a bit long.<br />This group inspection of a work product from the team has many
					benefits that go way beyond just a better marketing email.<br />First, it makes the feedback as
					immediate as possible.<br />No need to wait for people to review on their own and send in their
					feedback
					later on.<br />Feedback and adjustments might be made right there in the meeting.<br />Second,
					everyone
					has a voice, leading to a shared sense of ownership of every aspect of their product
					launch.<br />Last
					but not least, the team learns more about how their marketing teammate does their job, leading to
					greater trust and understanding between team members.<br />The sprint review is a time for the team
					to
					demonstrate what they’ve accomplished.<br />The sprint review is also where team members unveil what
					is
					called the product increment.<br />The product increment is what’s produced after a given sprint and
					is
					considered releasable.<br />A product is releasable when the team has developed a minimum viable
					product, which has a set of implemented features or requirements.<br />A minimum viable product is a
					version of a product with just enough features to satisfy early customers.<br />At the end of each
					sprint, only items that have met the definition of done are considered part of the product
					increment.<br />Anything that is not done goes back to the product backlog.<br />Great
					work.<br />We’ve
					now covered the activities that happen during a sprint to ensure that the team is focused and is
					building valuable solutions.<br />[MUSIC PLAYING] The sprint retrospective is an essential meeting
					of up
					to three hours for the Scrum team to take a step back, reflect, and identify improvements about how
					to
					work together as a team.<br />In a sprint retrospective, the Scrum team will reflect on what’s
					working
					or not working for the team regarding the people, the processes, and the tools.<br />What
					improvements
					are worth exploring in the next sprint?<br />And what improvements were put in place for the last
					sprint?<br />Were they helpful or not, and why?<br />In my experience, there are some key measures
					to
					take to ensure sprint retrospectives are a success.<br />First, it’s important to demonstrate the
					Scrum
					value of respect and always allow the team to remain blameless.<br />If any team member is worried
					there
					may be negative consequences for providing feedback, your outcome won’t be as
					beneficial.<br />You’ll
					need to create a safe space for candor by acknowledging potential awkwardness.<br />And if needed,
					create a space for anonymous or private feedback.<br />Participation is key because retrospectives
					only
					work if participants feel like their input matters.<br />If you notice folks aren’t volunteering
					their
					perspectives, search for ways to generate new ideas, such as asking them.<br />What is one thing we
					could try in the next sprint?<br />What slowed us down?<br />What happened that we didn’t
					expect?<br />The answers to these questions can help you understand how to improve.<br />For
					example,
					just recently my team discovered that having dependencies on stakeholders outside of our Scrum team
					was
					slowing us down.<br />In our retrospective, we decided to increase awareness of our priorities with
					these external stakeholders through some new communication channels.<br />Next, balance the negative
					with the positive.<br />Don’t just ask where you can improve.<br />But also ask things like, where
					did
					we notice success?<br />You want your team to feel like they were successful.<br />And you also want
					to
					recreate these successful outcomes.<br />And finally, make sure to act on it.<br />Teams can get
					discouraged from participating in future retrospectives if it feels like their feedback won’t
					inspire
					change.<br />Search for improvements or simply convert the things that worked best into your team’s
					habits and norms.<br />Facilitating conversation among the Scrum team, both during retrospectives
					and in
					everyday workflows, is an incredibly important aspect of being the Scrum master and a project
					manager.<br />[MUSIC PLAYING] In this video, we’ll explore two very important concepts that allow a
					Scrum team to manage their work as they progress through a sprint and the entire product
					backlog.<br />These two concepts are burndown charts and velocity.<br />Let’s start with what a
					burndown
					chart’s purpose is and how a Scrum team uses it.<br />A burndown chart measures time against the
					amount
					of work done and the amount of work remaining.<br />The goal of using a burndown chart is to keep
					the
					team aware of how they’re doing against their overall goals.<br />In a Scrum team, burndown charts
					reflect how the team is doing with completing user stories during the sprint.<br />The Scrum master
					will
					review the burndown chart, sometimes daily, to examine if the team will hit their goals or
					not.<br />And
					there’s some simple math and numbers here.<br />So now is a good time to mention what to do if your
					team
					is using t-shirt sizes, rather than story points.<br />In that case, simply map the sizes to a
					number.<br />And use that number for the burn down and velocity calculations.<br />For example,
					maybe an
					extra small is 1 point.<br />A small is 2 points.<br />A medium is 5.<br />A large is 8 and so
					on.<br />Here’s an example.<br />Let’s imagine our Virtual Verde team’s sprints are 4 weeks long,
					which
					will count as 20 business days.<br />In their July sprint, the sprint backlog had stories that added
					up
					to a total of 200 points to be completed.<br />If you assumed an even burn of points over the
					business
					days, you’d expect 10 points to be burned each day.<br />By day 5 in their sprint, 22 points had
					been
					burned or completed.<br />OK, it’s only 25% of their sprint.<br />So maybe things are on
					track.<br />By
					day 10, 45 points had been completed.<br />Uh-oh, we should have been approximately halfway done by
					now,
					which would be 100 points.<br />According to the burndown chart, we’re running late, according to
					our
					sprint goal.<br />Now, this isn’t the time to panic and stress out the team.<br />At this point, as
					Scrum master, you should already be discussing with your team to find out how you can help and
					unblock
					them.<br />By day 15, the burn down is 140 points.<br />Phew, the team is back to humming
					along.<br />By
					day 20, the burndown is 188 points completed.<br />Great job.<br />Let’s discuss what happened in
					the
					retrospective.<br />In Scrum, there’s a term for how many points a team burns down in a sprint on
					average.<br />That term is velocity.<br />In other words, velocity is a measure of how many points a
					team burns down during a single sprint on average.<br />When the team is conducting sprint planning,
					they’re using their average velocity over at least three sprints to determine how many items they
					can
					safely add to their sprint backlog.<br />There are a few things worth noting when it comes to
					calculating velocity.<br />First, there’s no such thing as a good velocity or bad
					velocity.<br />Velocity is simply what the team has historically been able to achieve in a
					predetermined
					timebox.<br />The next thing is that each team will have a different velocity, especially since each
					team decides their own point system calibration.<br />It’s impossible to compare your team’s
					velocity to
					another team’s.<br />For example, I’m currently on a team of three people.<br />And we’re burning
					down
					70 points in a one week sprint.<br />So our velocity is 70.<br />But on a previous five person team,
					our
					velocity for a two week sprint was only 120 points.<br />Was one team better or worse than the
					other?<br />Nope, just different.<br />Once you have a stable velocity and a refined backlog with
					prioritization and estimates, this unlocks an incredibly valuable superpower.<br />You can now tell
					your
					stakeholders and sponsors two important things.<br />You can tell them approximately how long it
					will
					take to complete the entire product backlog and how much of your backlog will be completed by a
					particular time.<br />This ability to confidently predict when things can get done is one of the
					most
					powerful tools in agile and Scrum, in my opinion.<br />Let’s imagine that our virtual Verde team has
					averaged 200 points in each monthly sprint for the last three months.<br />The team knows they have
					1,500 points left in their product backlog.<br />They now can say that it will take them
					approximately
					seven or eight sprints to complete the entire product backlog.<br />What if it’s July, and the team
					wants to know what will be available by January 1st?<br />No problem.<br />That’s five months
					away.<br />Just go down the backlog from the top, and draw a line when you hit 1,000
					points.<br />That’s
					a pretty confident estimate based on the past performance of the team.<br />Pretty powerful,
					right?<br />If you want to pull in the dates, you can use this information to decide to add people
					to
					the team and increase velocity, rearrange the priorities, or make other key project
					decisions.<br />On
					any given team, it can take multiple sprints to reach a stable velocity.<br />And that’s perfectly
					normal.<br />As the team gets used to estimating and working together, the velocity should begin to
					stabilize.<br />Now you know how to define velocity, velocity trends, and burndown charts.<br />You
					also
					learned a bit about how an Agile team reaches a stable velocity and what that entails.<br />Using
					these
					tools is essential to any high performing Scrum team.<br />They’re our powerful means to achieve
					execution predictability.<br />I’ll demonstrate another useful visualization tool in the next
					video.<br />Meet me there.<br />[MUSIC PLAYING] We learned about the importance of visualizing
					progress
					using burndown charts in the last video.<br />And good news, there are other visual tools that can
					also
					help a team progress throughout their sprint.<br />The tool we cover in this video may be familiar
					to
					you, since we briefly covered it in a previous video.<br />It’s the Kanban board.<br />Some teams
					refer
					to this as the Scrum board rather than the Kanban board.<br />While the two do have minor
					differences,
					they’re referring to the same basic tool.<br />The Scrum guide doesn’t specify exactly what a Scrum
					board is.<br />But some Scrum tools available in the market provide a board that adds some features
					to a
					Kanban board.<br />These features make it suitable specifically for Scrum.<br />Both boards have
					three
					main features that make it a great sprint tracking tool for Scrum teams.<br />There’s visualization,
					work-in-progress limits, also known as WIP limits, and flow of work.<br />Visualization can be an
					important strategy for learning and tracking.<br />This Kanban board communicates everything we need
					to
					know at a glance.<br />We can point at specific work items on the board we want to discuss, use
					images
					with variation in colors and sizes as we check in on work items.<br />And we can notice where the
					challenges are in our team.<br />Without this visualization, it’s not as easy to find out where we
					can
					make improvements.<br />These boards make it easy to notice where WIP limits break.<br />We learned
					earlier in this course that Kanban WIP limits are constraints on how many work items the team
					actively
					works on at any given time.<br />This provides focus for the team, which is one of our Scrum
					values.<br />Have you heard the idea that there’s no such thing as multitasking?<br />In Scrum, it
					can
					be very true.<br />And the more work you have, the less efficient you can become.<br />When you use
					a
					Kanban or Scrum board, each team may set a WIP limit based on their configuration and
					context.<br />This
					way it’s really obvious to notice when the team is going beyond the WIP limit.<br />And finally,
					using a
					Kanban board can give you a better sense of the flow of work through the team’s execution
					processes.<br />Physical Post-It notes or even virtual versions of Kanban or Scrum boards allows the
					team to experience the movement of work from one phase to another.<br />Using a Kanban or Scrum
					board,
					the team will move the items through the following stages, to do, doing, and done.<br />This action
					often takes place during the daily Scrum.<br />But the team can move items at any time.<br />For
					example, with our Virtual Verde team, let’s say that Leo, our plant vendor, has finished the item to
					finalize contracts with the three top plant vendors we plan to use for our initial launch.<br />Leo
					will
					go to the Kanban board and move his item from doing to done and find out what’s next to work
					on.<br />If
					for some reason that was the last thing for him in the sprint, he may reach out to his team to see
					where
					he can help a teammate with their work.<br />So to recap, Kanban and Scrum boards are really useful
					because they help you visualize your progress, set and maintain your team’s workload and WIP limits,
					and
					give you a sense of the flow of work throughout the teams execution process.<br />Awesome.<br />I’ll
					see
					you in the next video, where we’ll review a few software products that help a Scrum team manage all
					of
					this information.<br />[MUSIC PLAYING] We’ve covered a lot of ground in this section.<br />We’ve
					learned
					all about the various Scrum events and what each of them does to ensure a Scrum team’s
					success.<br />To
					wrap up this section, we’ll review the tools available to implement and facilitate the Scrum and
					Agile
					workflows.<br />These can help improve collaboration and keep your workflow transparent.<br />As a
					refresher, one of Scrum’s pillars is transparency.<br />So a Scrum team’s success is very dependent
					on
					transparency within the team.<br />And tools encourage everyone to be fully aware of progress and
					updates.<br />These tools will be used to store the product backlog, sprint backlog, and any other
					essential documentation.<br />Using Scrum tools will help your team keep all of your progress
					organized
					and in one centralized place.<br />We’ve already heard about scheduling and work management,
					collaboration, and productivity tools.<br />Let’s revisit those tools now from the perspective of a
					Scrum team.<br />Let’s talk about scheduling and work management tools.<br />In traditional project
					management, applications like Microsoft Project provide you with very powerful schedule and resource
					management capabilities.<br />In a Scrum team though, the most critical tool you’ll need is
					something to
					manage your backlog and your sprints.<br />Jira by Atlassian is a popular Agile team project
					management
					tool.<br />And it supports all aspects of team and backlog management.<br />It can be customized for
					your team and will provide you with a central place to find all things related to your Scrum team,
					your
					product backlog, your sprint definitions, your velocity, your burndown charts and much
					more.<br />After
					Jira, there are other tools on the market that your team can purchase that provides similar
					capabilities.<br />Some teams build their own Agile tooling inside of spreadsheets, too.<br />When
					it
					comes time to choose a tool, most of these tools will let you have a free trial period before you
					make a
					permanent choice.<br />If you’re searching for something simple and fun to try, I recently started
					using
					Trello’s Kanban capabilities, just for my own personal projects.<br />It’s helped me plan a move and
					organize a big birthday party for my dad.<br />Asana is another tool we’ve referenced in this
					program
					that worked great for sprint planning and backlog management.<br />Asana helps teams plan and
					coordinate
					their work from daily tasks to strategic initiatives.<br />With Asana, everyone can view, discuss,
					and
					manage team priorities.<br />This allows teams to understand who is doing what and their frame for
					each
					task.<br />It’s great for assigning tasks, automating workflows, tracking progress, and
					communicating
					with stakeholders.<br />These applications are built specifically to help a team manage a backlog
					and
					their sprints.<br />But there are many activities that these products can’t perform.<br />This is
					where
					additional tools for documentation, collaboration, and productivity come in.<br />You’ll want to use
					some form of documentation or word processing tool.<br />This ensures that you capture key
					information
					about your project in a long format.<br />Many products in this space feature both the documentation
					and
					the collaboration all in one tool.<br />Google Docs is a great example of this, but it’s not the
					only
					one.<br />Spreadsheets, such as Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets, are useful for most
					teams.<br />You
					can use spreadsheets to capture backlogs, and backlog item information, or any number of other
					pieces of
					information for your project.<br />You may also want a tool to create presentations, either using
					Google
					Slides or the Microsoft equivalent.<br />These presentation tools are used all the time to– you
					guessed
					it– present information to the team.<br />And finally, since it’s Agile, we value individuals and
					interactions.<br />So it’s essential that we have excellent tools for collaboration and
					communication.<br />The types of collaboration you’ll experience on a Scrum team are video
					conferencing,
					team and 1:1 online chats, and emails.<br />These tools will result in huge productivity
					improvements
					for your team.<br />They allow teammates to communicate more effectively, get quicker answers, and
					unblock themselves long before the next day’s daily Scrum.<br />There are so many useful
					applications
					out there to help Scrum teams maintain the desired transparency between team members.<br />And in
					Scrum,
					they decide what to use together.<br />ROWENA: Congratulations on finishing this video in the Google
