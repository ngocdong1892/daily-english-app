					Are you ready to learn some real life English with comprehensible input? Well, good, because today
					we are going to make an incredible dish from the country of Iraq. Today we are making Iraqi dolma.
					Let's go. Hey guys, it is your English speakaking friend Kyle and today we're going to learn, we're
					going to improve our English with comprehensible input.<br>
					What is comprehensible input?
					Comprehensible input is when a native speaker like me speaks slowly and clearly so that you can
					understand.<br>
					Guys, today I am super excited. We are going to make a dish that a lot of you guys have asked me to
					make. We're going to learn about all of these ingredients and I might be working harder than I have
					ever worked in a video to make you guys an awesome video to make me and the lovely camera wife an
					awesome dinner.<br>
					Okay, guys. The first thing we have to do is get our vegetables. These are vegetables. This is an
					onion. We've got different kinds of peppers. We've got zucchini.
					We've got yellow squash, parsley, tomatoes. Why? Are these a fruit or a vegetable?
					Fruit.<br>
					These are actually a fruit, guys. So, tomatoes are a fruit. Uh these are Oh, that's a little one.
					These are called grape leaves. So I guess that these come from the plants that grow grapes. So we
					are going to use all these things to fill up with a delicious filling and make our dolma because
					that's what Iraqi dolma is, guys. It is vegetables stuffed with rice, meat, and spices with a
					delicious sauce. Guys, I've been watching so many videos of this to prepare myself to make it for
					you. I can't wait. So, first thing we need to do is get all these vegetables ready.<br>
					Let's start with our zucchinis. So, we take our cleaver.
					You got to make a noise when you do it.
					All right, guys. Now, you guys saw this.
					This is a peeler. We used it to peel carrots. But it also does something else. It is also a corer.
					It removes the core from vegetables. The core means the center. So, we got we have to scoop all of
					the center stuff out here so we can stuff it with our delicious filling. And we're going to put all
					the stuff from the inside in our bowl because it goes with the rice and the meat to stuff the
					vegetables. All right, guys. Done with the zucchini. And it should look like that. Now, the yellow
					squash. And you do the exact same thing. Cut it in half.<br>
					Oh, but you forgot something.
					What did I Oh, that's right, wife. Smart wife. She knows. And then you use the same tool and core
					it.
					The yellow squash is done. And now it is time for the tomatoes. And tomatoes are a fruit.
					Fruit. All right, guys. So, you want to cut the tomato the top, but not all the way cuz we want to
					have like a little lid. Okay. This is a lid. A lid goes on top of something and covers it. So, with
					our tomatoes, we want a lid. And we'll use our little core and do the same thing. We're going to
					scoop out the inside of the tomato. And that's going to go in our filling. Good juicy tomato.
					And we're going to do the same thing.<br>
					All right guys, done with the tomatoes.
					And they should look like that. And they have their little lid. All right guys, the next thing we're
					going to work on peppers. This is an orange bell pepper, red bell pepper, and these are called
					banana peppers. Now, the peppers are a little bit different than the zucchini and the squash because
					do we want this in our domo life?<br>
					No.
					No, we don't want that. So, we're going to scoop the seeds out. Just put it in this plastic bag so
					we can throw it in the garbage. And we will do that with all of our peppers. All right. And our
					peppers are ready. Next thing is our onion. So, guys, I peeled the outer layer of this onion. I cut
					down to the middle with my cleaver and I boiled it.<br>
					I put it in boiling water for about 4 minutes so that it would be easier to do this. Now, we're
					going to peel the little layers off like this. And I've seen on YouTube a lot of the Iraqi chefs say
					that the onion dolma is the best part. So, we will see. I love onion, so I'm excited to try that
					part. And you need to peel each layer of the onion just like that.<br>
					All right, guys. We peeled our onion apart. We've got all these little layers. And in the middle,
					when it gets to this small part, they started breaking. So, we're just going to chop these little
					pieces up. Throw those in the filling. Okay, guys. Now, we're going to start getting our filling
					together. Our vegetables are prepared.<br>
					This is called an immersion blender. It blends everything up.
					All right, guys. Time to start getting our stuff put together for the filling.
					Those are the vegetables all blended up.
					Now, let's chop up some parsley. Going to chop the parsley with my cleaver to chop. And put that in.
					Boom.
					Boom.<br>
					Boom. Going to put some lemon juice. I'm just squeezing it into my hands so I could catch the seeds
					cuz we do not want the seeds in here. Now, we will put our rice in here. This is plain white rice.
					And I I rinsed it off with water. As we have learned in these cooking videos, food from this part of
					the world has a lot of delicious spices in it. So, let's get our spices in there. We're going to do
					one tbsp dried mint, one tablespoon mint, one teaspoon of sumac, a teaspoon is the smaller one, one
					teaspoon of smoked paprika, which is one of my favorite spices. It has a delicious taste. 1 teaspoon
					of cumin, one teaspoon of allspice, which my wife said smells delicious, one teaspoon black pepper,
					1 and 1/2 teaspoon of salt, and then we need some tomato paste. It says 2 tbsp of tomato paste, but
					there's a problem. What's the problem, wife?<br>
					We need to open it.
					We have to open it. What do we use to open this, wife?
					Um, I don't know how to say it.
					Perfect. Because I'm sure other people don't either. I don't know how to say this in any other
					language that I speak.
					This is called a can opener. And you use it to open it.<br>
					Open cans.
					Is this easy?
					Very easy. I am opening the can. Opening the can. All right. And we're just going to put two nice
					little spoons in there.
					Boom. Boom. All right. Little beautiful camera wife. What else is the filling missing?<br>
					The meat.
					The meat. So guys, I guess you could use beef or lamb, but we've really been liking lamb lately.
					They did not have ground lamb like this. They only have these chunks, so I am going to have to cut
					it up. Let's cut this up to nice little small pieces. All right, guys.<br>
					Put our meat in here. This is looking great. The last thing I'm going to put is just a little bit of
					this. And this is called pomegranate molasses. I made this. So, some stores have it, but it's not a
					very common ingredient here. I know it's a common ingredient for a lot of you guys. I had to make
					it. I had to buy pomegranate juice and cook it for like an hour with a little bit of extra sugar in
					there and some lemon juice.<br>
					We're going to put just a little bit in here and then save the rest for the sauce. Now, we mix. Okay
					guys, last thing to do, start making this. We're going to start with the grape leaves.
					Let's see if I could roll up a grape leaf like an Iraqi grandmother.
					Now, you're not supposed to put too much. And you kind of roll it like a burrito. And I am good at
					making burritos, right, wife?<br>
					Yes.
					So, like that.
					Wow.
					Hopefully, I'm doing good. My Iraqi. And guys, so this is another thing. A lot of these dish dishes
					from the Middle East, most countries have their own version.<br>
					It's like empanadas in South America.
					So, I don't want to say only Iraqis make make these, but anybody from this region of the world who
					makes things like this, tell me how am I doing? Am I wrapping these grape leaves good? Too big? Too
					small? Let me know, guys. I like to get feedback. All right, guys. I've made some of the stuffed
					grape leaves. I'm going to stuff everything else and then finish with these just to make sure we
					have enough stuffing for all the different kinds of vegetables. So, I will make more of these at the
					end if there's extra stuffing. So, let's go with zucchini. So, guys, the rice in here is not cooked
					and the rice is going to cook in the pot. What happens when rice cooks, wife?<br>
					Uh, it grows.
					It gets bigger. So, for that reason, you leave some space in here. M like that. So, I'm going to
					stuff all of our vegetables and I'll see you guys in a second. Okay, guys. Got our vegetables
					stuffed. Now, we've got to put it together in our pot. Okay. And first thing you do is put some good
					olive oil.<br>
					Good olive oil down so that nothing sticks. And then I'm going to use this brush to make sure it
					gets all over the pan. Now, a brush you use to do what?<br>
					I'm to brush. to brush.
					Now, you can brush your teeth, but not with this kind of brush. You can brush your hair. What else
					can you brush?<br>
					Your pet.
					You can brush your pet's hair. Mhm. And you can brush pots with olive oil. So, this is going to make
					sure that nothing sticks and won't come off. And olive oil gives a delicious flavor. All right,
					guys. Now, this thing that I'm going to do, you don't have to do, but I love meat, and this is going
					to be incredible. We're going to take some lamb chops and put them on the bottom.<br>
					And I'm just going to season this with salt. To season is when you put something on your food to
					make it taste better. So, we're just going to season this with salt because there's going to be so
					much flavor in that pot. hard doing things with my left hand. You guys ever think about that? How we
					have one hand that can do everything so good and then we have one hand that is like useless.
					Strange, right? All right, wife. Show how it's covering the bottom of the pot like that. Salt on
					this side.<br>
					So now when we're done, that's going to be on top. All right, guys. We're going to put some green
					onions in just for flavor. And we're going to do a whole I think they call this a head of garlic.
					Do they call it Oh, a bulb. Okay. A bulb. It say Spanish.<br>
					Yeah. All right, guys. It's hard sometimes when you read recipes in different languages and stuff.
					We're going to put a whole bulb of garlic in here. Right there in the middle. Boom.<br>
					That's going to be great flavor. Now, let's put our stuffed olive leaves around the edge like this.
					I cannot wait for this, guys. I have not been so excited for a dish since plav. I get excited a lot
					now, guys, now that I'm cooking all these dishes for you guys.<br>
					This is working out pretty good. All right, now let's get some of these big ones in here. The orange
					bell pepper.<br>
					Do you think it's going to have a good room for everything?
					Oh, yeah. And we'll put tomatoes, zucchinis. Hope I'm doing this right, guys. All not our garlic,
					our stuffed onions. You kind of just smash it all in there and try and make it fit in there as nice
					as you can. It's not very easy.<br>
					But you have to remember when rice cooks it gets bigger. What do vegetables do when they cook, wife?
					It gets smaller.
					Gets smaller.
					That's right.<br>
					I'm pretty happy with that. We'll see what happens. All right, guys. It needs a liquid to cook. So,
					we're going to make a sauce first. The juice from one lemon. Oh, and there's 1 and 1/2 cups of water
					in there already. So, I am squeezing the lemon to squeeze squeezing the juice out of the lemon. A
					little bit of salt. A little bit more of that molasses that I made, that pomegranate molasses. And
					then a tablespoon of tomato paste. And what am I doing, wife?<br>
					Stirring.
					Stirring it up. This is to stir. Or there's another word to mix it all together.
					What is your expectations?
					My expectations?
					Yeah.
					Ah, delicious, guys. It smells so good.<br>
					This molasses is incredible.
					So now we just pour it on in. A little bit more olive oil and we cook. Okay guys, so while we wait
					for our dolma to cook, it's going to be about an hour and a half to 2 hours. Let's learn some
					interesting facts about Iraq and test out this new microphone. Tell me guys if the audio sounds good
					in this little part about the facts. I only wanted to try the new microphone on this part because
					the Doma is going to be a lot of work and I did not want to record all of that work just to find out
					later when I edit that this microphone doesn't work good. So, this is the first small test trial run
					for this microphone. Tell me if the audio sounds good, please. The first interesting fact about
					Iraq, they call it the cradle of civilization. A cradle is something that you hold a baby in. So
					it's something where something is born like the birthplace of something.<br>
					And a long long long time ago there was an ancient civilization in the place that is now known as
					Iraq. At that time it was known as Mesopotamia. And Mesopotamia is thought to be the first
					civilization in the history of the world. Next interesting fact about Iraq.<br>
					The earliest form of writing was found in Iraq. A people known as the Sumerianss invented something
					called Kuniform script. I don't know if I said that correctly. Kuniform or ununiform script. And
					they were basically making little symbols on blocks of clay. Clay is like dirt, mud pushed together
					to become hard. And the last fact that I found pretty interesting, Muslims all around the world
					believe that Noah's Arc was built in Iraq. If you're familiar with Christianity, Judaism, Islam,
					they all share the story of Noah's Ark. And that is where God told a man named Noah that there was
					going to be a great flood. It was going to rain for 40 days and 40 nights, and all of the bad people
					in the world were going to die.<br>
					According to the story of Noah's ark, God told Noah to take two of every kind of animal and to build
					a giant boat called an ark. Well, according to Islamic tradition, Noah built his ark in the place
					that is now known as Iraq. All right, guys. Let's go try that dolma.<br>
					All right, guys. Our dolma has been cooking for like 2 hours, a little bit more than 2 hours. Camera
					wife is so hungry, guys. that I didn't show you, but I made a flatbread. The same exact recipe that
					I made in the Turkish kebab video. Okay. And can you show this, baby? That's what the dolma looks
					like from the top. Now, my Iraqi and Middle Eastern friends know what's about to happen. Okay, we're
					not going to take a spoon and do this. How boring. That would be boring. This is a very interesting
					dish. Okay, we're going to take our flatbread, put it up here. This guys you would call like a a
					platter. A platter is something you serve something on. Uh waiter carries around a platter.
					Okay, now I have to think about how to do this. Let's see.<br>
					I scared.
					My wife is scared. All right, guys.
					These are called oven mitts, and you use them when you're going to touch things that are very hot.
					All right, guys. All right, guys. Now, as some of our friends in Iraq might say, bismillah.
					Are you ready guys?
					That wow is our Iraqi dolma.
					I'm quite happy with it.
					So look good.<br>
					So that's the presentation, guys. Uh you want it to kind of stick together.
					Things are going to fall apart. That looks delicious. I don't even know how to try this. Let me get
					a fork, guys.
					Let me get a fork. All right, guys. Here is my fork. What should we try first, wife? I got to try
					the lamb. I'm falling apart, guys. Look, the bone is just sitting here. It's falling off the bone.
					We say that when something is when a meat is very soft.<br>
					Can't wait.
					Wow.
					Okay, let's try it.
					Oh, wow.
					The wrapped leaf. The wrapped grape leaf.
					Camera wife is going to love this so much. M. Oh my goodness. Wow.
					Wow.<br>
					Try some of the flatbread here. All right, guys. So, I'm trying to do something to respect the
					tradition. In a Middle Eastern Muslim home, I would not be touching things with this hand. You would
					eat with your right hand. Now, this comes from the Quran. It's a teaching of the prophet Muhammad.
					And another interesting thing that people who don't know anything about the Quran, whenever somebody
					says the name Muhammad, people say peace be upon him.<br>
					It's a very respectful tradition. They eat with their right hands. Can you guess why? Camera wife.
					You're wrong.<br>
					Try the bread. Camera wife. They eat with their right hands because this hand is used for
					cleanliness in the restroom for cleaning yourself. So the tradition is you would use your right hand
					to shake hands, to hand somebody food, to drink. And that's something that the Quran says. Muhammad
					tells his followers, eat with your right hand and drink with your right hand. It's a cleanliness
					thing. We're trying to respect the culture here. Anyway, guys, Iraqi dolma. Let's see. One more
					bite.<br>
					Oh, everybody on YouTube said the onion's the best. We've got to try the onion. Oh, that looks like
					a good hot one. Burning hot, guys. But absolutely delicious. Now, I'll probably eat like two or
					three bites of this and then camera wife will probably eat the whole thing cuz she's a hungry little
					camera wife.<br>
					All right, guys. As always, thanks so much for spending your time here learning English with us.
					Thank you, camera wife, for recording us and making this video possible. Appreciate every single one
					of you. See you all in the next video.<br>
					Just have to say guys, that's one of the best dishes I've ever had in my life.
					And I want to say one other thing that it's incredible being married, loving somebody, having
					somebody special to spend your time with, and the best thing, no baby, having someone to clean your
					dishes. All right, friends. Be well. Fear yourself.
