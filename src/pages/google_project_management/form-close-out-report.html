					communicate project problems.<br />In the upcoming activity, you’ll learn how to synthesize a
					project
					problem into a one-sentence summary for a senior stakeholder.<br />Combining information from
					multiple
					sources, like conversations, emails, and documents, is a skill that project managers use
					frequently.<br />It’s helpful to reference when leading conversations in meetings, writing
					documentation, and emailing team members regarding the project.<br />Strong communication involves
					combining information, and potential employers may want you to prove you’re capable of doing so
					effectively.<br />The problem summary you’ll write in the upcoming activity will be included in the
					practice email you’ll create later on.<br />OK, let’s discuss project problems.<br />Every project
					has
					its problems, and communicating those problems is a part of your job as a project
					manager.<br />Usually,
					project problems are small enough to address within the immediate project team, but occasionally,
					you’ll
					need to escalate problems and propose solutions to a senior stakeholder for their input and guidance
					on
					next steps.<br />Stakeholders shouldn’t have to read different project documents or consult multiple
					email threads in order to understand the project problem.<br />Instead, it’s your responsibility as
					a
					project manager to synthesize relevant information from multiple sources into a coherent summary
					that
					clearly communicates the issue.<br />To write an effective one-sentence overview of a problem,
					you’ll
					need to synthesize information from various sources like emails, presentations, meeting notes, and
					more.<br />Synthesizing requires gathering information from multiple sources and using those points
					to
					help form your own analysis.<br />For example, it wouldn’t be very helpful to send a stakeholder a
					link
					to your project plan because it doesn’t give them a thorough understanding of what the problem
					entails.<br />To determine which information is relevant and belongs in a one to two-sentence
					overview
					for your stakeholders, ask yourself, how can I communicate a decision in a way that makes it easy
					for
					them to decide?<br />For instance, let’s say the project plan has five tasks overdue because of
					supplier
					delays, and this may ultimately affect the final deliverable of your project.<br />You’ve been
					working
					on creating a few solutions to mitigate this issue.<br />Rather than sending your stakeholders a
					link to
					the plan and pointing out all of the overdue tasks, you might summarize the problem by telling them,
					a
					number of tasks have run past their due date because of supplier issues, so we recommend hiring a
					second
					supplier to hit the deliverable date.<br />Otherwise, we’ll need to push the launch date
					back.<br />This
					way, you present the problem succinctly to your stakeholders and offer a solution.<br />This allows
					stakeholders to agree with your solution, disagree with your solution, or provide one of their
					own.<br />Either way, you’ve communicated the problem and proposed a solution which is your role as
					the
					project manager.<br />Let’s review.<br />Communicating project problems is a part of your job as a
					project manager.<br />It’s also your responsibility to synthesize relevant information from multiple
					sources into a coherent summary that clearly communicates the issue.<br />Synthesizing requires
					gathering information from multiple sources and using those points to help form your own
					analysis.<br />[MUSIC PLAYING] Objectives and key results are a tool for organization-wide goal
					setting.<br />OKRs combine a goal and a metric to determine a measurable outcome.<br />Let’s break
					OKRs
					down.<br />The objectives portion of the OKR defines what needs to be achieved, which is similar to
					a
					goal.<br />The key results portion of the OKR defines how an organization, team, or individual will
					tangibly measure their success in meeting the objective.<br />For example, one of Sauce and Spoon’s
					objectives might be to prioritize customer needs and wants.<br />So the key result that indicates
					they’ve reached this objective could be addressing feedback from customer reviews within 24
					hours.<br />Earlier in this course, you learned that OKRs can be a helpful reference point when
					determining if a project goal is relevant to the needs of an organization.<br />If a project in its
					goals help contribute to the larger OKRs of an organization, that’s a good sign that your project is
					relevant and worth the time and money required to complete it.<br />OKRs can be a kind of shared
					language for an organization.<br />Here at Google, for example, every project, big or small, aims to
					contribute in some tangible way to our organization-wide OKRs.<br />Struggling to determine how a
					project might help us reach our OKRs can be a strong indication that we should re-evaluate the
					project
					as a whole.<br />OKRs can be really helpful to reference when communicating with stakeholders about
					project problems.<br />You can make it clear to a stakeholder why a given problem needs to be
					addressed
					by identifying the specific ways in which that problem might impact an organization’s wider
					OKRs.<br />You can also point to them to explain to stakeholders why a problem is worth their
					attention.<br />Stakeholders, especially those who hold senior positions within an organization,
					often
					have a lot of work to focus on even beyond your project.<br />Connecting a solution to a company’s
					OKRs
					can catch a stakeholders limited attention.<br />Let’s take the Sauce and Spoon objective of, we
					seek to
					run an efficient, profitable business model, or, we seek to prioritize our customer needs.<br />As
					you
					fine-tune the problem summary you began in the previous activity, you can add a sentence to explain
					how
					the issue jeopardizes the Sauce and Spoon mission to run an efficient business model and meet
					customer
					needs.<br />Let’s review.<br />In this video, you reviewed OKRs, or Objectives and Key Results,
					defined
					OKRs as a tool for organization-wide goal setting, and learned how they’re helpful when
					communicating
					with stakeholders about project problems.<br />[MUSIC PLAYING] As a project manager, identifying and
					managing issues is part of the job.<br />And if an issue is big enough to escalate to a senior
					stakeholder, then it’s probably an issue you’re hoping to resolve as soon as possible.<br />Email
					can be
					an effective tool for quickly escalating a problem and asking for a decision from a stakeholder on
					how
					to proceed.<br />That’s why it’s really important to ensure that your email is written in a way that
					effectively captures a stakeholders attention and gets you the response you need.<br />There are a
					few
					best practices to keep in mind to make sure your email doesn’t get ignored.<br />First, think about
					what’s most important to your stakeholder.<br />Often, senior stakeholders will be more interested
					in a
					problem’s potential impact on an organization than its impact on a single project.<br />This is
					where
					connecting project problems to an organization’s OKRs comes in handy.<br />Identify how a problem
					will
					impact your organization as a whole and ensure that you clearly communicate that impact within the
					first
					two sentences of your email.<br />Once you’ve determined what’s most important to your stakeholder,
					you’ll be better prepared to draft an effective email.<br />Remember to write a clear subject line
					that
					briefly states what your email is about.<br />It’s also helpful to include language in your subject
					line
					that indicates what you’d like your stakeholder to do upon reading your email.<br />Do you need them
					to
					review a document you’ve attached to the email?<br />Try adding the words, please review, to your
					subject line.<br />Is this an urgent email that you need a quick response to?<br />Then you might
					try
					adding the word urgent to the subject line.<br />Stakeholders, especially those who hold senior
					positions within an organization, usually receive many emails throughout the day.<br />Including
					terms
					like urgent, timely, decision needed, or please review can help draw attention to your message and
					make
					clear the action you’d like your stakeholder to take.<br />And remember to also keep the body of the
					email brief and to the point.<br />When communicating about a project problem to a busy senior
					stakeholder, your email should briefly outline the problem, explain how it might impact an
					organization’s goals, and clearly state the decision you need from your stakeholder in order to
					proceed.<br />That’s it.<br />Write one or two sentences that summarize your problem along with
					another
					sentence that identifies how the problem may impact your organization’s OKRs.<br />If there are
					documents or additional information that your stakeholder might need to review to make an informed
					decision, consider including hyperlinks or attachments with the information in your email.<br />Once
					you’ve finished writing your email, be sure to proofread it for misspellings, grammatical errors,
					and
					inaccurate hyperlinks.<br />Use spell check and other grammar check functions in your email
					application
					or online to help you make sure everything looks good.<br />Let’s review.<br />When writing an email
					to
					stakeholders, make sure to do the following– think about what’s most important to your stakeholder,
					write a clear subject line, keep the body of the email brief, and proofread for misspellings,
					grammatical errors, and inaccurate hyperlinks.<br />Someday, when you have to communicate issues to
					stakeholders in real life situations, you’ll see how managing, tracking, and communicating project
					problems is a huge part of running the project.<br />In the upcoming activity, you’ll apply email
					writing best practices when you compose an email to a stakeholder of the Sauce and Spoon tablet
					pilot.<br />[MUSIC PLAYING] By now, you’ve been with Peeta through some of the most essential pieces
					of
					managing and delivering a project.<br />You’ve followed her as she set goals, navigated through the
					planning process, managed quality, escalated issues to stakeholders, and more.<br />Great
					work.<br />We’ve reached the point in the project where Sauce and Spoon has launched the tablets
					after
					passing quality standards, and most of the project manager’s work is done.<br />In this video, we’ll
					discuss one of the last elements of project management– closing out the project and showcasing its
					impact.<br />Before Peeta can consider her project completed, she has a few more tasks to take care
					of.<br />One of those tasks is to create a closeout report.<br />The closeout report is a great
					opportunity to compile all links and documentation into one place, a practice we like to call good
					project hygiene.<br />The closeout report is also a time for reflection on your team’s performance,
					and
					it helps your team ensure every task was completed.<br />A closeout report confirms the project is
					done,
					summarizes deliverables, success metrics, feedback, lessons learned, and next steps, and serves as a
					reference document for the organization.<br />If a follow up project is required or a similar
					project is
					initiated, having these artifacts in one place will help these future projects run
					smoothly.<br />And
					should another similar project occur, future project managers will be set up for success if they
					have
					meticulous information on past projects.<br />An effective closeout report helps ensure that
					everyone is
					satisfied with the work that was done, finalizes the efforts of the team and lets people move on to
					new
					projects and tasks, and increases the impact of the team’s work through communication with other
					people
					who may not have been as involved in the project.<br />In addition to serving as a reference
					document
					for the organization, a project closeout report is a document created by project managers for
					project
					managers, future project managers, and anyone interested in the project elements and
					artifacts.<br />Ideally, you want anyone unfamiliar with the project to be able to read it and get a
					full understanding of what the project was, why it was done, and how well the project went.<br />In
					fact, the project closeout report you will complete in this course should be able to stand alone for
					your potential employers.<br />You should be able to give them this document as a sample of your
					work.<br />They should understand the context of the Sauce and Spoon tablet rollout project, and get
					a
					demonstration of your ability to synthesize and communicate information clearly.<br />In a project
					closeout report, you’ll start by adding your project summary.<br />In this section, you’ll need to
					include the objectives.<br />Another way to think about this– what was the desired result for this
					project?<br />Next, is methodology or approach.<br />Make sure to denote which methodology or
					approach
					your team used.<br />Is your team using waterfall?<br />Agile?<br />Lean?<br />Maybe a combination
					of
					these or something else.<br />One of the most important aspects of the closeout report is the
					performance baseline.<br />Here, you’ll describe the actual results and compare them to the
					objectives
					laid out in the planning and execution phases.<br />You’ll compare specifications, like actual
					project
					schedule versus planned project schedule, actual project costs versus planned project cost, and
					planned
					scope versus delivered scope.<br />There’s even a handy notes column so you can explain any
					discrepancies or issues that arose.<br />The remaining sections are key accomplishments and
					outcomes,
					lessons learned, next steps, and project documentation archive.<br />When filling out these
					sections,
					being thorough is key.<br />We’ve included questions to help guide you and ensure you’re being
					detailed
					enough, but feel free to take it one step further in your own closeouts by getting even more
					specific.<br />And when you’re filling out these sections, keep in mind that the purpose of the
					closeout
					is to compile and archive the most important aspects of the project.<br />Let’s review.<br />When
					writing a project closeout, make sure to include the following– project summary, methodology,
					performance baseline, outcomes, lessons learned, next steps, and add a project documentation
					archive.<br />Hopefully, I’ve explained just how important the closeout report is for a
					project.<br />If
					a project is repeated or a similar project is initiated, this important documentation, which
					includes
					your learnings and project outcomes, will set future project managers up for success.<br />[MUSIC
					PLAYING] The purpose of creating an impact report is to show others the value that’s been added to
					your
					project.<br />Usually, it’s in the form of a presentation guided by a deck or slideshow you’ve
					created.<br />Unlike a detailed closeout report that’s designed for future project managers or other
					readers interested in the project details, an impact report is typically created for senior
					stakeholders
					or project sponsors who weren’t involved in the day-to-day details of the project.<br />Reporting
					your
					project impact is key for a few reasons.<br />It can help you to analyze results to adapt and
					improve
					services, motivate staff and senior stakeholders by celebrating achievements, build trust and
					credibility with supporters, sponsors, funders, and anyone benefiting from the project, and share
					lessons with similar organizations.<br />Let’s get into the elements that should go into an impact
					report.<br />One of the most important pieces of an impact report is the executive
					summary.<br />It’s
					where you can highlight the key points of the project for your stakeholders.<br />An executive
					summary
					is a few sentences to a paragraph that describe the project’s purpose and outcome.<br />It provides
					an
					overview of the main points of a larger report.<br />It’s written to share with the stakeholders who
					might not have time to review the entire report.<br />So think of the executive summary as a
					highlight
					reel for your project.<br />The purpose is to give senior stakeholders a concise and strong
					description
					of positive outcomes within the project without giving them too much information or being too
					vague.<br />When creating an executive summary, ask yourself this question– if an executive didn’t
					have
					time to read all of the project documentation and only had time to read this executive summary,
					would
					they be able to understand the project highlights?<br />Your executive summary should aim to answer
					questions like, how effectively was the project delivered?<br />And what did we learn from
					it?<br />In
					addition to asking yourself some foundational questions, it’s a good idea to review your SMART
					goals,
					your business case, and your project charter to help you write the executive summary.<br />These
					will
					help you reflect on and identify the most important aspects of your project, which are likely tied
					to
					key accomplishments and positive outcomes.<br />One useful tip you might find helpful when creating
					an
					executive summary is to actually draft the rest of the impact report first.<br />This will help you
					hone
					in on the most relevant information to include in your summary.<br />In this impact report template,
					you’ll see slides for results, what worked, and next steps.<br />In these slides, you should aim to
					describe your project in detail using things like graphs and images where applicable to tell the
					story
					of the project’s success.<br />The more detailed you get in these slides, the easier it’ll be to
					pull
					out and identify the highlights and add them to your executive summary.<br />After you’ve drafted
					those
					sections of the impact report, you’re ready to draft the executive summary.<br />You’ll want to
					include
					elements of the following information– project vision.<br />Here, you’ll specify what the purpose of
					the
					report was.<br />What need is the project fulfilling?<br />Key accomplishments– this is your
					opportunity
					to discuss which activities, tasks, and milestones helped you to find success.<br />What are the
					main
					highlights in the impact report?<br />Did your project increase profitability?<br />What value did
					the
					project add?<br />Talk about those here.<br />Lessons learned.<br />This is where you’ll talk about
					potential improvements.<br />How will you change future processes for the
					better?<br />OK.<br />Let’s
					explore an example of an executive summary.<br />Say you just completed a project to launch a new
					money
					saving app that automatically sends money from its users checking accounts into designated savings
					accounts bi-monthly.<br />The amount sent from checking to savings is determined by how much money
					you
					have in your checking account at the time of withdrawal plus a few other variables like the
					frequency of
					deposits.<br />Your beta users loved the app because it helped them build a savings account without
					even
					thinking about it.<br />So let’s start with our project’s vision.<br />It might say something like,
					our
					goal was to help users get ahead financially by creating an algorithm-based automatic deposit system
					that pools money into a savings account.<br />Now, let’s talk about what the project
					accomplished.<br />These are your key accomplishments.<br />So you might say, as we prepared to
					launch,
					we helped 1,000 beta users save over $300,000 in just six months.<br />This proved the use case and
					need
					for our app.<br />And in key accomplishments, you might also want to include financial
					highlights.<br />So we could say something like, by charging users $3 per month with 1,000 users in
					six
					months we netted $18,000.<br />Finally, it’s good to talk about what things could have been done
					differently.<br />Include lessons learned by saying something like, the main feedback received from
					our
					beta testing was that our users wanted more frequent updates about when their money was being
					transferred.<br />We’ll add that in our update.<br />OK.<br />Let’s review the main ideas we’ve
					covered
					in this video.<br />Reporting your impact can help you to analyze results to adapt and improve
					services,
					motivate staff and senior stakeholders through celebrating achievements, build trust and credibility
					with supporters, sponsors, funders, and those benefiting from the project, and share lessons with
					similar organizations.<br />And we also covered executive summaries and how they’re essential to
					highlighting the key elements of your project to stakeholders.<br />Now that you’ve got a better
					idea of
					what an impact report might entail, it’s time to write your own executive summary.<br />We’ve built
					out
					an impact report so you can get a sense of what a typical report might look like.<br />All you have
					to
					do is fill in the executive summary based on your new insights.<br />ROWENA: Congratulations on
