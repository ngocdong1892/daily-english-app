				<p id="1cf468a0-53d4-81cb-873c-c800af5931da" class=""> In this video, I’m going to talk about the
					concept of
					organizational structure and the project manager’s role within a given structure.<br />Keep in mind
					that
					your role won’t be the same for every team or organization because many companies are structured
					differently.<br />But this overview will serve as a foundation for wherever you work.<br />So what
					is
					organizational structure?<br />Organizational structure refers to the way a company or organization
					is
					arranged or structured.<br />This structure also tells you how job tasks are divided and coordinated
					and
					how all the different members of the organization relate to one another.<br />In other words,
					organizational structure gives you a sense of who reports to who.<br />But organizational structure
					is
					much more than that.<br />Understanding the different types of organizational structures can serve
					as a
					map to help you determine where you fit in, who you should communicate with, and how frequently to
					communicate with them.<br />Now that we have a basic overview of the definition of organizational
					structure, let’s look at the various organizational hierarchies that you may encounter at
					work.<br />An
					organization’s structure is most commonly mapped out using a reporting chart or org chart, which is
					short for organizational chart.<br />Reporting charts show the relationship between people and
					groups
					within the organization and details who each person or group reports to.<br />There are a few
					different
					types of organizational structures.<br />But for this course, we’re going to focus on two of the
					more
					popular ones, classic and matrix.<br />Let’s start with classic.<br />The classic grouping includes
					what
					are usually called functional or top down structures.<br />The classic grouping follows a typical
					chain
					of command, where the Chief Executive Officer, also known as CEO, and other executives are at the
					top,
					followed by directors or managers, then their direct reports and so on.<br />Each of these directors
					or
					managers typically oversee teams within their function of the organization, like marketing, sales,
					or
					human resources.<br />You can see this type of structure in effect by looking at a branch of the
					military.<br />Take the Army for example.<br />You may enter the Army as a private and report up to
					a
					sergeant, who oversees multiple people in your squad.<br />And that sergeant ultimately reports up
					to a
					lieutenant and so on.<br />If your organization works in this structure, as the project manager, you
					might communicate regularly with your manager, the person directly above you, and also with your
					peers,
					who work on the same types of projects as you.<br />But it isn’t always a straightforward top down
					approach.<br />There are other factors at play that make organizational structures a bit more
					complicated than we can see on paper.<br />For instance, you may have project teams that sit across
					different functions.<br />This is common in many companies, Google included, and is usually referred
					to
					as the matrix structure.<br />You might think of a matrix structure as a grid, where you still have
					people above you, but you also have people in adjacent departments who expect to hear updates on
					your
					work progress.<br />These people may not be your direct bosses, but you are responsible for
					communicating with them since they may inform changes to your work.<br />For example, at Google, we
					have
					the major functions of marketing, sales, and more with the traditional reporting chain.<br />But we
					also
					have programs for our products, like Google Search, where project teams consist of program managers,
					engineers, user experience, or UX designers, and so on.<br />And each team member reports to their
					own
					management chains.<br />Another example is my organization.<br />It’s called global affairs.<br />I
					have
					a direct manager who oversees the work I do in my core role and who is responsible for delivering my
					performance reviews.<br />But because I work with multiple people across other teams and
					specialties, I
					often get asked to manage projects where I’m informally working with lead program managers in other
					organizations.<br />Similar to my own manager, I provide updates to that program manager, seek their
					approval, and solicit feedback on our partnership and progress.<br />So to recap, the classic
					structure
					follows a traditional top down system of reporting, and the matrix structure has direct higher ups
					to
					report to and stakeholders from other departments or programs.<br />Knowing which kind of
					organizational
					structure you’re working in plays a major role in how you prepare for and carry out your project or
					even
					in an interview.<br />During an interview, you can ask about the type of organizational structure
					the
					company uses and where your role will fit in.<br />This will help you and the interviewer
					communicate
					clearly about the people you will engage with daily and the expectations for the role.<br />An
					organization’s structure provides the framework for accountability and communication.<br />As the
					project manager, it’s vital that you understand who you’re reporting to on each project and, just as
					importantly, who the members of your team report to.<br />Knowing the organizational structure also
					tells you how and where to get the resources you’ll need so you can get the project done
					efficiently.<br />When you understand the organization’s structure, you’ll be able to identify how
					it
					impacts the way you manage the project.<br />One way organizational structure can impact the way you
					manage a project is by the amount of authority given to the project manager.<br />Authority has to
					do
					with your ability to make decisions for the project that impact the organization.<br />In some
					cases,
					you might have the authority to do things like select the vendors who provide services or goods for
					the
					project.<br />Other times, you might have a set of vendors selected for you.<br />Your level of
					authority and responsibility will vary from project to project.<br />Another way organizational
					structures can impact project management is through resource availability.<br />Managing a project
					is a
					lot easier when you know how to access the people, equipment, and budget that you need.<br />Let’s
					explore how different structures can affect the way you manage a project.<br />In a classic
					structure,
					you might find yourself with less authority and a tighter scope.<br />You may need to rely on
					getting
					approval from the appropriate managers, directors, and department heads in order to move forward and
					complete certain tasks.<br />In this case, it’s likely that these people are in charge of the people
					on
					your team and the resources you need.<br />As a project manager working in a classic structure, you
					may
					depend on the managers in your organization to approve resources.<br />In other words, the amount of
					people working on your project or the budget that you have allocated to your project is decided by
					the
					leaders of your department or function.<br />In a classic structure, you may have to go through a
					chain
					of approvals and advocate for more resources if you need them.<br />For example, if you need a
					budget
					increase, you would report this to your manager.<br />Then your manager might escalate this up to
					their
					management chain to get approval.<br />That’s the classic structure, a traditional top down
					arrangement
					of employees and authority.<br />Now, let’s explore the matrix structure.<br />The main difference
					with
					a matrix structure is that employees often have two or more managers or leaders they’ll need to work
					with and update.<br />Your team members will have their functional manager and you, the project
					manager.<br />If members are working on multiple projects, they may have even more
					managers.<br />This
					can affect your authority as a project manager, as you will need to cooperate with more than one
					leader
					in the organization.<br />You may need to share resources and negotiate priorities.<br />The key is
					to
					make sure you know who your stakeholders are and who controls what since the chain of command isn’t
					always as clearly defined as in the classic structure.<br />Because there isn’t always a clear chain
					of
					command in a matrix structure, you need to make sure you have identified and communicated with
					anyone
					you might need to report to and get approval from well before the project begins.<br />Once this is
					established, though, your project within a matrix structure should be able to run
					efficiently.<br />Matrix structures emphasize a strong project focus from the team and the
					organization.<br />So you, as the project manager, generally have more autonomy to make decisions
					and
					gather resources as needed.<br />As I hope you noticed, the way an organization is structured can
					have a
					big impact on the planning and execution of your project.<br />Understanding all of this will help
					you
					run and manage a project much more efficiently.<br />Next, I’ll tell you about organizational
					culture,
					another factor that impacts how you manage your project.<br />Catch you in a bit.<br />Let’s begin
					with
					two quick questions.<br />What do you know about culture, and how do you define culture?<br />When I
					hear the term culture, the first things that come to mind are things like languages, food, clothing,
					and
					types of dress.<br />It’s important to note that there are other maybe less obvious, but just as
					impactful, parts of culture like beliefs, traditions, and customs.<br />When we learn about
					someone’s
					culture, we gain a much deeper insight and more complete picture into who they are and how they
					navigate
					the world.<br />The same can be true for organizations.<br />An organization’s culture provides
					context
					and acts as a guide for what their people value, how they operate on a daily basis, how they relate
					to
					one another, and how they can be expected to perform.<br />There are many ways to define
					organizational
					culture.<br />Some definitions emphasize teamwork and innovation, while others focus on attention to
					detail and achievement.<br />Entire thesis papers, workshops, and conferences are dedicated to
					defining
					and analyzing organizational culture.<br />We only have a few minutes here, so I’ll do my best to
					sum it
					up.<br />Organizational culture is, in part, the values employees share as well as the
					organization’s
					values, mission, history, and so on.<br />In other words, organizational culture can be thought of
					as
					the company’s personality.<br />Understanding an organization’s culture will help you navigate your
					team
					more effectively toward achieving the project’s goal.<br />It also impacts the way you plan your
					project.<br />You’ll need to be familiar with an organization’s culture so that you can minimize
					conflict and complete the project with as much support and harmony as possible.<br />An
					organization’s
					mission and values can provide clues to its culture.<br />If you can demonstrate how the project
					supports the company’s mission or how the project aligns with the company’s values, you’ll have more
					support from executives and stakeholders to get the approvals and resources you need.<br />Pay
					attention
					to what leaders in the organization value when conducting business.<br />Does the management team
					care
					about speed over perfection?<br />How do people within the organization make decisions?<br />Do they
					thoroughly examine every option for every decision?<br />This will help inform which values are the
					most
					important to them and how you can approach your decision-making.<br />If you’re ever stuck in your
					project and need guidance about making a certain decision or are unsure how to communicate with
					someone
					in the organization, reviewing the mission and values may help direct you toward the right way to
					handle
					that situation.<br />Here’s an example.<br />If the company values stability and user feedback, it
					might
					encourage expanding the project timeline to allow for testing and then making decisions based on
					those
					testing results.<br />If the company values innovation and revenue growth, it might encourage a
					shorter
					timeline to get the product out faster and taking some risks to try out new ideas.<br />As a project
					manager, when you understand the different types of values and what to prioritize, you’ll have an
					idea
					of how you can better prepare for conversations within the organization.<br />Ideally, you’ll want
					to
					have a good sense of an organization’s culture before you start the first phase of your
					project.<br />If
					you are interviewing for a project management position, asking about the culture is a great way to
					get
					more information about the company.<br />It also shows the interviewer that you’re knowledgeable
					about
					the impact culture can have on a project.<br />To help you gain a better sense of an organization’s
					culture, consider the following questions.<br />How do people prefer to communicate?<br />Is it
					primarily through scheduled meetings, via email, over the phone?<br />How are decisions made,
					majority
					vote or top down approvals?<br />What kinds of rituals are in place when someone new comes to the
					office?<br />Are they taken out to lunch, given a tour of the building, or introduced to the
					staff?<br />How are projects typically run?<br />Do they prefer classic?<br />Do they prefer matrix
					or
					some other style of project management?<br />And finally, what kinds of practices, behaviors, and
					values
					are reflected by the people in the organization?<br />Is overtime or weekend work an
					expectation?<br />Are there company-sanctioned social events?<br />Finding out what the company
					values
					will tell you a lot about the culture and how to handle communication, manage expectations, and
					identify
					potential conflicts as you work through your project.<br />Once you begin working on a project, here
					are
					some ways to navigate company culture that will help you get the most out of your team and ensure
					that
					your project is supported.<br />As I just discussed, make sure to ask questions.<br />As you observe
					the
					culture, try asking your peers what they think is going well and what they would change.<br />Your
					peers
					may have the same opinion as you.<br />And if not, you may learn something new didn’t learn in the
					interview process.<br />Either way, you’ll be in a better place to assess risk, adjust your current
					project, or be more prepared for projects in the future.<br />It’s also a good idea to make
					observations.<br />It’s important to understand how things work and what people like and respect
					about
					the company’s culture.<br />When working in different geographies, it’s also important to be aware
					of
					established customs like bowing, shaking hands, or wearing head coverings.<br />This will help you
					gain
					understanding and form respectful relationships.<br />Lastly, it’s important to understand your
					impact.<br />Be aware of your role as a change agent.<br />A change agent is someone who helps the
					organization transform by focusing on improving organizational effectiveness and
					development.<br />You
					and your project will most likely affect the organization in some way.<br />Sometimes just the
					presence
					of a project manager creates changes in the office environment or employee dynamics.<br />If your
					project requires major changes that the organization must adapt to, be mindful of how extreme those
					changes could be, and seek feedback and approval early on.<br />The company may not agree with
					certain
					kinds of changes that don’t seem to fall in line with their mission, vision, or culture.<br />It’s
					important to recognize the limits or boundaries of changes to implement and understand what would be
					the
					most beneficial for the project and the company overall.<br />As you can see, organizational culture
					has
					a strong influence over how decisions are made about the project.<br />The way an organization is
					structured usually influence the type of culture that exists.<br />So it’s important to consider
					both
					structure and culture when planning and carrying out your project.<br />Coming up, we’ll talk about
					the
					way your project can create change in the workplace and how to get stakeholders and employees on
					board
					with implementing your project.<br />Let’s talk about change management.<br />Sometimes the
					deliverable
					of a project is a new tool or new process that must be adopted by the organization.<br />You’ve just
					learned that understanding organizational structure and culture will help you plan for and manage
					your
					project.<br />It will also help you roll out changes from your project to an organization.<br />In
					project management, the process of delivering your completed project and getting people to adopt it
					is
					called change management.<br />Understanding change management can ensure that a project is
					completed
					successfully and that the organization accepts and adopts the recommendations from the
					project.<br />For
					example, if you were launching a new time tracking system for employees, the project wouldn’t be
					successful if the employees didn’t adopt the new system.<br />When you understand change management
					and
					your role in the process, it can ensure a smooth rollout of changes and easier
					adoption.<br />Adoption
					is often the first step to your project having the desired impact once it goes live.<br />So let’s
					get
					started.<br />As a new project manager, you may not be responsible for planning all of the required
					change management for your project.<br />But regardless, you can help the success of the project by
					understanding your role in the process and how your organization may react to that change.<br />It’s
					important to recognize that it’s the people in an organization who are directly impacted by any
					changes
					in the workplace.<br />Implementing a new project can mean changes to processes, budgets, schedules,
					and
					employee roles and responsibilities.<br />Even aesthetic changes, like building a new wing,
					renovating
					the lobby, or switching to a new company logo, means employees will have to adjust to something new
					and
					different.<br />Something as simple as adding a new logo can lead to a major headache for the
					employees
					who have to swap out all the old stationery and make sure everyone in the office is using the new
					logo
					correctly.<br />When you consider the success of your project, it’s important to keep in mind the
					changes that people will need to implement as a result.<br />Thinking through these changes will set
					you
					up for success in getting your project accepted and adopted.<br />There are many change management
					models and strategies, and a quick internet search will provide you with more explanations and
					examples
					than you will probably ever need.<br />While we have additional readings on change management coming
					up,
					feel free to read on any articles on the topic from well-respected project management organizations
					to
					keep learning.<br />Though there are lots of different models, they all share the same general
					concepts.<br />Change management and project management is centered around three core concepts and
					best
					practices.<br />The first core concept is creating a sense of ownership and urgency around the
					project.<br />Ownership means getting others to feel like they are empowered to take responsibility
					for
					the successful completion of their tasks.<br />Urgency means getting them to understand that the
					project
					is important and to identify what actions need to be taken to move the project along.<br />When team
					members feel a sense of ownership and urgency around a project, it increases interest, motivation,
					and
					engagement with the project outcome.<br />Another core concept is to figure out the right
					combination of
					skills and personalities when selecting the people who will work on your team.<br />Find people
					whose
					knowledge and skills complement one another.<br />If your team is selected for you, see if you’re
					able
					to choose who gets assigned which tasks.<br />And if that’s not possible, then it’s extra important
					for
					you to find ways to connect with your team.<br />This will get them excited about the project, so
					then
					they can be advocates for change when it’s needed.<br />One effective way of motivating your team is
					to
					communicate clearly your vision and approach for the project.<br />Then you can share how you see
					everyone working together as a team to make it happen.<br />Communicating this idea clearly allows
					others to share in your vision and take ownership in bringing it to life.<br />The final core
					concept is
					that ever-important one, effective communication.<br />And I can’t stress this
					enough.<br />Communication is key.<br />Having effective communication with your team means being
					transparent and upfront with your plans and ideas and making information available.<br />Make sure
					your
					team, along with the rest of the organization, is kept up-to-date on your progress.<br />This will
					allow
					everyone to feel like they are included and part of the project.<br />Once your project is complete,
					you
					may experience some resistance or a few roadblocks.<br />Remember, change doesn’t happen overnight,
					so
					don’t give up on it yet.<br />If you do get some pushback, you can move the process along by helping
					folks adjust, rewarding their efforts, and reminding them of the overall value the project is
					providing
					long-term.<br />Understanding the change process can help you determine how you can support a
					successful
					response to your project.<br />For example, understanding the importance of communication will help
					you
					be mindful of clearly communicating project plans to your team as well as communicating the expected
					impact of the project with the rest of the organization.<br />Remember learning about agile project
					management?<br />Well, since it’s a popular methodology that you’ll probably use at some point, I
					wanted
					to point out that many of the principles of agile project management align with successful change
					management.<br />How might an agile team approach change management, you ask?<br />Well, being
					receptive
					to change is a core value in agile teams.<br />So you will often find that they are in a state of
					evolution or are constantly adapting to change.<br />If this seems like a lot to remember, no
					stress.<br />We’ll continue learning more about these concepts throughout the course.<br />Just
					know, as
					the project manager, you can enact effective change management approaches in all of your
					interactions.<br />Change management is actually a huge undertaking and a project in itself.<br />As
					mentioned, you may not always be responsible for leading and planning the entire end-to-end change
					management process.<br />Instead, you may ask a member of the project team, your manager, or another
					senior leader to help take on that transition.<br />If you are participating in change management,
					then
					someone else is responsible for successfully implementing the changes.<br />Let’s say you’ve just
					completed the project of creating the new check-in system.<br />The project is now at the point
					where it
					needs to be installed and adopted by the organization, but you don’t have the formal authority or
					influence to enact this change.<br />Your role as a project manager then doesn’t include getting
					employees to use the new system.<br />That’s someone else’s job.<br />But just because you are not
					the
					one directly calling for or leading the change, there is still ways in which you can and should
					participate.<br />And that’s what this section is about, the process of handing off the project and
					the
					ways in which you, as the project manager who created the new system, can stay involved.<br />Being
					empathetic to the challenges of change management can help you support the process in subtle
					ways.<br />In this case, participating in change management might mean communicating with employees
					throughout the project about how the system will provide a better experience for their
					customers.<br />You support the process by providing employees with information, so they feel
					prepared
					to adjust to changes once the system is ready to launch.<br />Since participating in change
					management
					is such a big part of being a successful project manager, I want to take you through a few examples
					so
					you can see how this might play out in different types of organizations.<br />You’ll see how to
					combine
					your knowledge of organizational structure and culture to make decisions about planning for the
					change
					management process.<br />Let’s explore the same pharmacy check-in project in two different
					organizational structures and with different team cultures to understand how these ideas are
					applied.<br />Say the pharmacy chain is a classic organizational structure and has an informal
					corporate
					culture.<br />The final project requires a name change from the old check-in system, called Speedy
					Care,
					to the new system, called Speedy Check-In.<br />Getting this change implemented is an example of
					change
					management.<br />As the project manager, you need to participate in the change management process by
					communicating the project needs through the appropriate channels.<br />In this case, the Chief
					Executive
					Officer, or CEO, sends an email to the c-suite.<br />Now, these are all the chief level officers in
					an
					organization.<br />The CEO lets them know that the name must be changed and to please inform their
					teams
					to implement the name change.<br />Since this is a classic structure within a hierarchical
					organization,
					the budgets are managed separately, and the marketing department needs to request an extra $10,000
					to
					change all of their printed posters for the stores.<br />This request goes back up to the Chief
					Financial Officer, or CFO.<br />There may be other cost adjustments and process changes that need to
					happen across the organization to ensure a successful system name change.<br />In this instance, you
					may
					need to have multiple meetings with others to help them understand what is changing and
					why.<br />Now,
					suppose that the pharmacy chain is a matrix organization structure and has a formal corporate
					culture.<br />What does change management look like in this scenario?<br />Well, you might meet with
					representatives from marketing and technology to explain the overall budget impact for all the
					necessary
					changes.<br />With a formal culture, you might write a document that describes all budget, timeline,
					and
					training impacted by the name change.<br />Then you might circulate that document to get feedback
					and
					alignment from all the stakeholders and share that feedback with the CEO so they can understand the
					full
					scope of the name change.<br />The feedback and alignment from the stakeholders will tell the CEO
					how
					the change management process went.<br />Did everyone agree on the implications?<br />Was the
					feedback
					positive, or was there resistance?<br />Then when the CEO needs to communicate the name change to
					the
					entire organization, she may have someone on her team write up a formal memo that describes why the
					name
					change needs to happen and share out the memo to her staff and their teams.<br />Keep in mind, these
					are
					just examples, and every organization’s structure, team culture, and change management processes are
					going to be different.<br />But understanding this framework can help you navigate how to
					effectively
					participate in and support change management.<br />This understanding can allow you to ask yourself
					questions that will inform change management, such as how will the organization react to
					change?<br />Which influencers can affect change?<br />What are the best means of
					communication?<br />What change management practices will lead to the successful implementation of
					my
					project?<br />And so on.<br />The answers to these questions will help you prepare for a variety of
					possible scenarios and craft solutions to effectively support the adoption of your
					project.<br />They
					will also help you navigate possible challenges along the way and lead your project through a
					successful
					change management process.<br /></p>
