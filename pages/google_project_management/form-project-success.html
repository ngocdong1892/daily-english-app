					you’ve
					completed a project charter and a project plan for the Sauce and Spoon tablet rollout
					project.<br />Coming up, we’ll move from the planning phase of the project life cycle to the
					execution
					phase.<br />But before you can begin executing, you’ll need to make sure your project’s quality
					management plan has been established so you know you’re delivering a project that meets your
					stakeholders’ expectations.<br />In the upcoming videos and activities, you’ll practice defining
					quality
					standards for your project.<br />Then you’ll evaluate how successfully the project standards are
					being
					met and present your findings to stakeholders.<br />You’ll also create a retrospective document,
					which
					project managers use during discussions about project progress and any process improvements that
					need to
					be made.<br />Before we get started, let’s review the project scenario for this course.<br />Sauce
					and
					Spoon is a small but growing chain of restaurants with five locations.<br />They’ve hired Peta as
					their
					first in-house project manager to launch the pilot of tablet menus at two of their
					locations.<br />Over
					the next several videos, I’ll share helpful information you can use to complete each activity and
					assessment.<br />And I’ll offer tips that you can take with you after you complete this
					course.<br />By
					the time we’re done, you’ll understand how to establish a list of quality standards for one aspect
					of
					the Sauce and Spoon project.<br />You’ll also practice writing evaluation questions and survey
					questions
					that’ll help you determine if the quality standards are being met.<br />And finally, you’ll learn
					how to
					improve the process along the way and create a retrospective document, which you’ll be able to add
					to
					your portfolio of project management documents.<br />[MUSIC PLAYING] For the Sauce and Spoon tablet
					project, we’ll focus the details of a quality management plan on quality standards, evaluation
					questions, and feedback surveys to ensure that the project is delivering on quality and producing a
					desired outcome.<br />After this video, you’ll practice project quality management by identifying
					quality standards for the Sauce and Spoon tablet pilot.<br />Let’s get started.<br />There are many
					benefits of creating and maintaining quality management in a project.<br />Some of these benefits
					include delivering a quality product, decreasing overhead, and increasing collaboration and ongoing
					reviews.<br />Overhead is another word for costs.<br />Quality management helps decrease overhead by
					reducing the amount of errors that would cost the organization money to fix.<br />Quality management
					processes ensure that the team is always learning and providing feedback, which, in turn, ensures
					that
					the project is on track to achieve its intended outcome.<br />In earlier courses, we covered the
					main
					concepts of quality management.<br />I’ll do a quick review here.<br />The main concepts are quality
					planning, which I defined at the beginning of this video, quality standards, which are the
					requirements,
					specifications, or guidelines that can be used to ensure the materials, products, processes, and
					services are fit for achieving a desired outcome, Quality Assurance, or QA, which is a review
					process
					that evaluates whether your project is moving towards delivering a high-quality service or product,
					and
					Quality Control, often known as QC.<br />Quality control refers to the techniques that are used to
					ensure quality standards are maintained when a problem is identified.<br />Here, we’ll focus on
					building
					quality standards for the Sauce and Spoon project.<br />But in many projects, all of these concepts
					get
					built into an overarching quality management plan, which documents all the information needed to
					effectively manage quality throughout the project life cycle.<br />The quality management plan
					defines
					the policies, processes, and criteria for project quality, as well as the roles and responsibilities
					for
					carrying them out.<br />Again, there are lots of different ways to develop and track quality
					management
					for your project.<br />But the benefits and main concepts that make up quality management remain the
					same.<br />Let’s review.<br />Some of the benefits of quality management include delivering a
					quality
					product, decreasing overhead, and increasing collaboration and review.<br />And the main concepts of
					quality management are quality planning, quality standards, Quality Assurance, or QA, and Quality
					Control, or QC.<br />Understanding these benefits and concepts will help you ensure you deliver a
					project that meets your stakeholders’ expectations.<br />[MUSIC PLAYING] Now that we’ve reviewed the
					benefits and main concepts of quality management, we’ll explore what it means to define quality
					standards.<br />We’ll also discuss how to evaluate those standards to ensure you’re meeting the
					project’s goals.<br />Before we get into discussing quality standards, let’s define what we mean by
					project quality.<br />Quality means making sure that you deliver what you say you will and that you
					do
					so as efficiently as you can.<br />Getting a project done on time and under budget doesn’t
					necessarily
					mean you’ve met your goals.<br />You need to be sure you’ve delivered a project that meets your
					stakeholders’ needs.<br />That’s why project quality is tracked throughout the life cycle of the
					project.<br />You can measure quality by defining quality standards for the various aspects of the
					project, like major tasks, milestones, and deliverables.<br />Quality standards are the requirements
					and
					specifications that your product or service must meet in order to be considered successful by your
					organization and the customer.<br />Establishing standards helps you identify ways of testing and
					evaluating the project’s quality throughout the planning and execution phases and after the project
					has
					launched.<br />If the quality of different aspects of a project is failing to meet the agreed-upon
					standards, you then have the opportunity to adjust your project plan to meet those
					standards.<br />Let’s
					use an example from the Sauce and Spoon project.<br />One of the deliverables is training of
					management,
					front-of-house staff, and back-of-house staff.<br />How will you know if that deliverable has been
					fulfilled successfully?<br />What are the expectations or standards your stakeholders have for
					meeting
					this requirement?<br />For this deliverable, think about what the staff needs to be able to do or
					demonstrate at the end of the training.<br />Does each staff group need to be trained on the same
					things?<br />Will management have different training requirements from front-of-house and
					back-of-house
					staff?<br />And does the training need to fit within a specific time frame, budget, or geographic
					location to be considered successful?<br />Your answers to questions like these will be the start of
					your list of quality standards for this deliverable.<br />There are lots of resources that can help
					you
					determine the standards for your project.<br />And standards will look different depending on the
					type
					of project.<br />The first resources to consult are project documents, like the business case and
					project charter.<br />These documents state the goals, scope, budget, and other details that can
					clarify
					the different requirements of the project so it’s acceptable to your stakeholders.<br />Just like
					you
					did when you identified tasks and time estimates, if you need more information to help you determine
					quality standards, you can have conversations with experts and stakeholders.<br />And you can do
					some
					industry research.<br />For example, if you need to know how long it takes the tablets to recharge,
					ask
					the vendor who will be training the staff or the tablet sales representative.<br />It’s also a good
					idea
					to have conversations with the stakeholders who are funding the project to understand their
					perspective
					on how long they expect the tablets to last before needing to be replaced.<br />Do industry research
					on
					the internet to see if there are established quality standards for the type of project that you’re
					working on.<br />For example, software and construction industries have established quality
					standards
					related to functionality, design, and safety.<br />Other categories of established quality standards
					that you’ll find in many industries include ease of use, productivity, effectiveness, and customer
					satisfaction.<br />It’s important that your standards are objective and measurable so you can
					clearly
					identify that the standard has been met.<br />As you have conversations and conduct your research,
					you
					might notice stakeholders referring to a general category, like ease of use, without providing
					specifics.<br />As the project manager, you should aim to get specific details by asking, what would
					be
					a sign that the tablets are easy to use or hard to use?<br />You might get a response like, it
					shouldn’t
					take longer than 20 seconds to place an order.<br />Or returning customers report that it’s faster
					to
					use the tablet versus placing an order with a server.<br />Now you have objective, measurable
					standards.<br />Let’s consider a few questions to ask yourself when considering various
					standards.<br />If standards are related to productivity and effectiveness, you might want to ask
					questions like, should the existence of the tablets change anything about how the front-of-house
					staff
					works?<br />Does it make them faster or allow them to serve more tables at one time?<br />If
					standards
					are related to customer satisfaction, you could ask questions like, how would the tablets ideally
					impact
					the customer’s experience?<br />What would you want the customer to do or say as a result of using
					the
					tablets?<br />By asking yourself or your task experts these kinds of questions, you can narrow down
					the
					standard that you’re aiming to make objective and measurable.<br />All of these resources, such as
					project documents, conversations with experts, and industry research, can help you determine the
					quality
					standards for different aspects of your project.<br />But remember, you’ll still need to use your
					critical thinking skills to determine the right standards and adjust them if necessary to meet the
					specific needs of your project.<br />Let’s review what we’ve discussed so far.<br />Quality means
					making
					sure that you deliver what you say you will and that you do so as efficiently as you
					can.<br />Quality
					standards are the requirements and specifications that your product or service must meet in order to
					be
					considered successful by your organization and the customer.<br />There are lots of resources that
					can
					help you determine the standards for your project, including project documents, like the business
					case
					and charter, conversations with experts and stakeholders, and industry research.<br />Some common
					categories of established quality standards from various industries include functionality, design,
					safety, ease of use, productivity, and effectiveness.<br />And finally, it’s important that your
					standards are objective and measurable so you can clearly identify that the standard has been
					met.<br />Coming up, you’ll use your critical thinking skills to determine quality standards for one
					part of the Sauce and Spoon tablet project.<br />Then you’ll learn how to evaluate against your
					standards to ensure that your project is achieving the required level of quality.<br />[MUSIC
					PLAYING]
					In the last video, we reviewed the main concepts of quality management and defining quality
					standards
					for a project.<br />Then, after analyzing project documentation and a conversation between Peta and
					stakeholders, you helped solidify a list of quality standards for one of Sauce and Spoon’s project
					deliverables.<br />Once the quality management plan is underway with clearly defined quality
					standards,
					you’re ready to measure against your standards and can finally begin implementing the
					project.<br />Since the last activity, Peta and her team have begun implementing the tablet
					rollout.<br />Both of the restaurants that were selected for the pilot have had tables outfitted
					with
					tablets.<br />The staff has been trained, and guests have been placing their orders using the new
					tablets.<br />In this video, we’ll discuss the importance of evaluation as it relates to the
					project’s
					quality management plan, specifically quality assurance.<br />Remember, quality assurance consists
					of
					reviewing processes to evaluate whether or not your project is delivering an acceptable level of
					quality.<br />And evaluation involves observing, measuring, and then comparing your findings to a
					set of
					agreed-upon criteria.<br />This could be your quality standards or the overall goals of your
					project.<br />Coming up, you’ll create evaluation questions as part of the QA process so that you
					can
					measure how well your project is meeting the established quality standards.<br />Understanding how
					to
					create strong evaluation questions will give you the tools and skills you need to measure the
					success of
					your project throughout the project life cycle.<br />Let’s get started.<br />In the same way that
					quality management plans may look different for each project, quality assurance can be implemented
					in a
					variety of ways.<br />Some examples of quality assurance are beta testing, internal checklists, and
					feedback surveys.<br />Each of these methods allow you to evaluate and measure how well your project
					is
					meeting its goals.<br />Evaluation is a form of research designed to promote learning and inform
					decisions.<br />It also provides accountability and helps you assess to what extent the project has
					achieved its objectives.<br />When you use evaluation, you’re able to improve upon, judge, and learn
					about different aspects of the project and the project itself.<br />For example, with the Sauce and
					Spoon project, evaluation can help you improve how to implement the staff training process more
					efficiently.<br />It might help you judge or assess whether something is working the way it was
					intended
					or whether you should continue in the same direction.<br />It could be that the staff had a hard
					time
					learning how to use the tablets because the touchscreens kept malfunctioning, in which case, you’d
					need
					to assess whether or not to continue with the original launch date.<br />You also need to make sure
					that
					the project is not creating any unintended problems, either for the organization, your team, or
					anyone
					else impacted by the project’s existence.<br />For example, you’ll need to assess when the best time
					for
					tablet installation is.<br />If you schedule a tablet installation when the restaurant is open, that
					might create a negative dining experience for restaurant guests.<br />By reflecting on areas of
					improvement and judging how certain aspects of the project performed, you learn what things made the
					project run as intended, how it can be replicated, and how challenges can be overcome in the
					future.<br />Your evaluation may have a single focus, like identifying what needs to be improved or
					judging whether a project or process should continue in its current format.<br />Regardless of your
					goals, your evaluation will ultimately allow you to assess all three of these areas of improvement
					and
					lead you to a better understanding of the overall success of the project, as well as its impact on
					and
					benefit to the organization.<br />OK, so now that we know why evaluation is used in project
					management,
					let’s get into the evaluation process so that you know how to carry out an evaluation and get the
					information you need.<br />In order to identify what you really want to know about your project,
					first
					articulate why you’re evaluating.<br />Understanding your “why” will shape the types of questions
					you
					ask about your project.<br />This goes back to improving, judging, and learning.<br />Even though
					all
					three of these will be addressed to some degree, certain aspects will have a more specific focus for
					evaluation.<br />You can narrow down what to focus on by reviewing both the project goals and
					organizational goals and determining how the aspect you’re evaluating connects to one of these
					goals.<br />Let’s discuss an example.<br />The Sauce and Spoon project has just reached one of its
					last
					milestones, the completion of three key deliverables that are required for project launch
					testing.<br />Those deliverables are installing the tablets, integrating the tablets with the POS
					system, and training the staff to use the tablets.<br />In an upcoming meeting with stakeholders,
					Peta
					will need to provide an update on the project’s progress and share an evaluation of this
					milestone.<br />It’s important for Peta to share this evaluation since it will inform stakeholders
					on
					future phases of the project and beyond, including a tablet rollout at two more restaurant
					locations.<br />So Peta’s “why” is judging the quality and performance of the tablets and
					identifying
					ways to improve the training process.<br />Once you’ve decided what your reasons for evaluating are,
					you’re ready to write out your evaluation questions.<br />An evaluation question is a key question
					about
					the outcomes, impact, and/or effectiveness of your project or program.<br />There are two main
					categories of evaluation questions– questions that ask how you can make improvements and questions
					that
					help you measure and compare.<br />Questions that help you improve sound like this.<br />How can we
					improve?<br />What is working, and what’s not working?<br />Which goals are being met?<br />Who is
					benefiting?<br />What are the most common participant reactions?<br />Next, we have questions that
					measure and compare.<br />These questions will help you make judgments about how or whether to
					proceed
					with a process or with the project itself.<br />Questions for measuring and comparing sound like
					this.<br />What were the results?<br />Were there unintended outcomes?<br />What were the costs and
					benefits?<br />Are there any lessons to be learned?<br />Should we continue?<br />So if we think
					back to
					the Sauce and Spoon project, one of the evaluation questions might be, to what extent do tablets
					improve
					the staff’s work performance?<br />If you keep in mind the overall goals of the project, you’ll be
					able
					to write effective questions that generate the type of data you want.<br />Effective evaluation
					questions meet the following criteria.<br />They address stakeholder or user values, interests, and
					concerns.<br />They relate to the purpose of the project and of evaluation.<br />They’re worth
					answering
					and are important for the project and beyond.<br />And they’re practical and feasible to answer with
					available resources.<br />Amazing job.<br />Let’s review some of what we’ve learned so
					far.<br />Evaluation is a form of research designed to promote learning and inform
					decisions.<br />It
					also provides accountability.<br />An evaluation question is a key question about the outcomes,
					impact,
					and/or effectiveness of your project or a key aspect of your project.<br />And there are two main
					categories of evaluation questions, those that ask how to make improvements and those that help you
					measure and compare.<br />[MUSIC PLAYING] Simply put, indicators state what you want to measure or
					evaluate, like the number of something, level of satisfaction, preferences, or demographic
					information,
					such as age, gender, experience, and so on.<br />Similar to the way quality standards add
					specificity to
					your deliverables and goals, evaluation indicators take your evaluation question and determine the
					specific type of response you’re aiming for.<br />You’ll need this information to understand whether
					or
					not your project or process meets the quality standards that were agreed upon in the project
					plan.<br />Let’s return to the Sauce and Spoon project and the evaluation question, which asks, to
					what
					extent do tablets improve the staff’s work performance?<br />To evaluate this, you’ll have to ask
					yourself, how are you going to measure work performance?<br />You’ll have to decide on indicators of
					work performance, like faster table turnover rates, higher tip averages, or higher-quality rating
					from
					customers.<br />Another way to think of indicators is that they provide pathways for answering your
					evaluation questions.<br />Indicators demonstrate that the outcomes are achieved and provide
					measurable
					evidence of meeting a goal.<br />They also include visible signs, like test scores, attendance
					rates, or
					observed behavior.<br />The word “indicate” means “point out” or “show.” Evaluation indicators point
					out
					or show the way to answer the evaluation question.<br />This could include visible signs of how the
					staff works with the new tablets.<br />Observed behavior, such as fewer staff members congregating
					by
					the beverage station or arriving late to work, could be an indicator of increased
					productivity.<br />Or
					over 90% staff compliance with the tablet ordering process could be an indicator of order placement
					accuracy.<br />Awesome.<br />Let’s review.<br />Evaluation indicators determine what data needs to
					be
					collected that will help you answer your evaluation questions.<br />This includes clues, signs, or
					markers that measure one aspect of a project and demonstrate how close that aspect is to meeting the
					quality standards that have been established.<br />[MUSIC PLAYING] By now, you should have created a
					list of evaluation questions related to your quality standards for the Sauce and Spoon tablet
					rollout
					project and added evaluation indicators for each question.<br />In this video, we’ll discuss the
					survey
					development process.<br />And I’ll explain how a survey question is different from an evaluation
					question.<br />Surveys are one of the tools that project managers use to get answers for their
					evaluation questions.<br />There are lots of methods for collecting data, and surveys are a popular
					method in project management.<br />In a survey, each respondent answers a set of clearly defined
					questions, and the data are collected and analyzed.<br />This data can be used to demonstrate
					specific
					examples of the evaluation indicators you identified for your project.<br />For the tablet rollout,
					Peta
					has decided to create customer surveys as a way to get answers to the project’s evaluation
					questions.<br />So in an upcoming activity, you’ll write a set of survey questions and add them to
					your
					quality management plan.<br />Being able to develop a survey and write survey questions is important
					because it demonstrates your ability to understand the goals of your project and assess how your
					stakeholders and users value the project.<br />This helps you determine if you’re achieving your
					quality
					goals and where you need to make adjustments.<br />Let’s start with a brief review of
					surveys.<br />Surveys are tools you can use to evaluate and measure the quality of a project’s
					process,
					goal, or deliverable.<br />Making surveys a part of your quality management plan is one way to help
					you
					understand what’s working and what’s not working.<br />Surveys assess the criteria you want to
					evaluate
					and provide you with data that will point out whether you’ve met your quality
					standards.<br />Designing
					an effective survey that will deliver the data you want is a skill and follows a strategic
					development
					process.<br />First, you’ll need to develop evaluation questions and define your evaluation
					indicators,
					which you’ve already done.<br />Then you can determine what type of survey to design and questions
					to
					ask that will give you the data you need to answer your evaluation questions.<br />Since you’ve
					already
					come up with your evaluation questions and indicators, the next step is to determine what types of
					survey questions you’re going to ask.<br />As a reminder, a survey question is different from an
					evaluation question.<br />An evaluation question is a key question about the outcomes, impact,
					and/or
					effectiveness of your project or program, whereas a survey question is designed to collect data
					which
					can help you answer your evaluation questions.<br />In other words, survey questions are a more
					direct
					interpretation of your evaluation questions, designed to get data points.<br />Let’s consider a
					specific
					example– the Sauce and Spoon evaluation question that asks, to what extent do tablets increase work
					performance?<br />One of the indicators of work performance is how much side work the staff are able
					to
					complete during a shift.<br />Some corresponding survey questions might be, are the tablets easy to
					use?<br />Was there enough time during the training to practice and ask questions?<br />On average,
					how
					many of your side work tasks are you able to complete during a shift?<br />Since using the tablets,
					how
					often have you sent back an incorrect order?<br />The answers to these questions will give you data
					to
					track and answer your evaluation questions.<br />So how do you write effective survey questions that
					will address what you’re trying to evaluate?<br />There are two different types of survey questions
					you
					can ask– open-ended and closed-ended questions.<br />Open-ended questions require more than one-word
					answers, such as yes or no.<br />They ask respondents to answer in their own words.<br />For
					example,
					what went well during the presentation?<br />Or what did you find most useful or interesting about
					the
					presentation?<br />The point is that the respondent has to construct their own answer to the
					question
					rather than selecting from a list of predetermined answer choices.<br />Closed-ended questions can
					be
					answered with a single response, like yes or no, or true or false, or selecting a single answer from
					a
					list.<br />Let’s examine three types of closed-ended questions in more detail.<br />The first type
					of
					closed-ended question asks for yes/no true/false type answers.<br />These are questions like, did
					you
					order an appetizer?<br />And have you eaten at this restaurant before?<br />The second type of
					closed-ended question is multiple choice.<br />Multiple-choice questions have– you guessed it–
					multiple
					answer choices.<br />You’re usually instructed to select one of the answer options or to select all
					that
					apply.<br />The question could be something like, how often do you dine at this location each
					month?<br />And then a range of answer options, like zero to one, two to three, four to five, and
					five
					or more.<br />A third kind of closed-ended question is a scaled question.<br />Scaled questions
					provide
					more than two options, but they’re different from multiple choice because they ask the respondent to
					rate their answers on a scale, for example, how often something occurs, how much they like or
					dislike
					something, or how important they think something is.<br />A sample scaled question might be, on a
					scale
					of one to five, how do you rate your overall dining experience, with one being poor and five being
					excellent?<br />Regardless of the question type, creating good survey questions is a skill that
					takes a
					bit of practice.<br />Here are some tips.<br />First and foremost, make sure your questions are
					asking
					what you mean to ask.<br />Each question should be specific and address only one measurable
					aspect.<br />Be careful not to make assumptions about your respondents.<br />For example, don’t
					assume
					that everyone taking your survey knows or enjoys the same things or has similar life
					experiences.<br />Ask questions and provide answer options that allow people to answer accurately
					about
					their experience.<br />At the same time, you want to make sure that your questions don’t provide too
					much detail or information.<br />If you do, you might end up influencing the respondent to answer in
					a
					certain way, which could unintentionally create bias.<br />Wow.<br />That was a lot of
					information.<br />Let’s review so it’s fresh in our minds.<br />Survey data helps you determine if
					you’re achieving your quality goals and where you need to make adjustments.<br />Surveys can also
					help
					you understand what’s working and what’s not working, help you assess the criteria you want to
					evaluate,
					and provide data that will point out whether you’ve met your quality standards.<br />The survey
					development process includes developing evaluation questions, defining your evaluation indicators,
					and
					determining what type of survey to design and questions to ask.<br />[MUSIC PLAYING] In the last
					video,
					we discussed the value of feedback surveys and how to create effective survey questions.<br />Then
					you
					had the chance to write some questions for one of Sauce and Spoon’s user feedback
					surveys.<br />Since
					the last video, the Sauce and Spoon surveys have been administered, and the data has been
					collected.<br />This data is the result of your evaluation.<br />So now it’s time to analyze the
					data
					and report your findings on how well the project is measuring up to its quality standards.<br />In
					this
					video, we’ll cover tips and best practices for determining your audience, choosing the style of your
					evaluation report, and delivering an effective presentation.<br />We’ll also discuss how to
					distinguish
					between reviewing data and presenting an evaluation.<br />Then, in the next activity, you’ll apply
					what
					you’ve learned to analyze survey data and create presentation slides for an upcoming stakeholder
					meeting.<br />You’ll be able to add these slides to your project management portfolio to demonstrate
					your ability to synthesize and summarize data into recommendations for a particular
					audience.<br />There
					are different ways to present an evaluation, and you’ll need to decide which style is best for your
					project and audience.<br />Start out by considering your audience.<br />Think about what’s most
					meaningful to them, as well as how much time they have.<br />If your audience is a mix of roles or
					groups, like team members, managers, stakeholders, and executives, consider the best way to share
					information with each group.<br />In some cases, you’ll need to present the same data in different
					ways.<br />Different audiences have different reasons for wanting information.<br />Your team, for
					example, could benefit from a detailed report so they can address aspects of the project they’re
					responsible for.<br />However, groups like senior stakeholders and executives typically do not need,
					want, or have the time for a detailed analysis.<br />They would rather have a summary of the most
					important information and the impact it has on their investment in the project.<br />After you’ve
					considered your audience, you should create a detailed evaluation report that addresses your
					evaluation
					questions.<br />You can then take the detailed report and summarize the information into the most
					appropriate format for a given audience.<br />In addition to a full report, two common reporting
					styles
					include a summary sheet and a slide-based presentation.<br />A summary sheet is a one- or two-page
					write-up with just the most relevant information.<br />Think of it as a flyer or snapshot of your
					findings.<br />And a slide-based presentation uses digital slides to visually present
					information.<br />Presenting evaluation findings should not just be a raw data report.<br />Your
					presentation needs to reflect what the data means and explain how it informs the response to the
					evaluation questions.<br />In order to do this, you need to filter and analyze the data.<br />This
					is
					probably the most important part because this is where you make sense of the data for
					yourself.<br />By
					filtering and analyzing, you become familiar with the results, the respondents, and what those
					results
					mean in regards to project quality.<br />Here’s the difference between reporting data and presenting
					evaluation findings.<br />Let’s say the survey data reveals that 36% of respondents reported a
					negative
					dining experience with the tablets.<br />But what does that data mean?<br />It could mean several
					things.<br />It could mean that the tablets weren’t installed correctly, resulting in performance
					glitches.<br />It could mean the tablets are poor quality.<br />So even if they were installed
					correctly, the tablets just didn’t function very well.<br />It could mean the staff wasn’t trained
					well
					enough, resulting in delayed or incorrect orders.<br />Or it could mean that respondents simply
					didn’t
					like using the tablets and prefer a standard dining experience.<br />You see, data alone isn’t
					enough.<br />You need to conduct additional analysis that explains the data.<br />Your job is to
					figure
					out what the data means and explain how the data answers your evaluation questions.<br />When you
					can
					explain what the data means in your own words, you’ll have the basis for your presentation.<br />A
					good
					way to start analyzing data to present is to look for trends, patterns, and anomalies.<br />Another
					tip
					is to share this process with some of your team members.<br />Taking turns sharing what you think
					the
					data means allows you to check your understanding and uncover additional information through your
					varied
					perspectives.<br />After you’ve analyzed your data and know how you’d like to present it, shape the
					story of your findings by tying it all together into one cohesive narrative.<br />Take some time to
					think about what you’re hoping to achieve, the points you want to make, and the questions and
					concerns
					you want to answer.<br />A great way to present an evaluation is through a story.<br />Storytelling
					is
					the process of turning facts into narrative to communicate something to your audience.<br />This is
					essentially what you do when you present your evaluation findings.<br />You tell the story of your
					data.<br />We provide some great tips and more details of the storytelling process in those earlier
					courses, so check them out if you need more help.<br />For the tablet project, the point of the
					presentation is to demonstrate to stakeholders whether or not the project is successfully meeting
					quality standards.<br />So you might start by reminding them of the overall goal and purpose of the
					project.<br />From there, identify the milestone that’s being evaluated and how it’s expected to
					meet
					the project goals.<br />Explain what the data revealed, but don’t cover every single data point or
					survey question.<br />Again, you’re telling a story about the data, not presenting the raw data
					itself.<br />Identify any major issues the data revealed, and summarize the rest.<br />If the data
					reveals that things are going well, pick a few highlights and move on.<br />If there are some major
					failings, suggest possible solutions or craft specific questions you need answers to.<br />Let’s
					review.<br />There are different ways to present an evaluation.<br />You need to decide which style
					is
					best for your audience.<br />To do this, consider what’s most meaningful to them and how much time
					they
					have.<br />In some cases, you’ll need to present the same data in different ways.<br />Common
					reporting
					styles, in addition to a full detailed report, are a summary sheet and a slide-based
					presentation.<br />An evaluation is not simply a raw data report.<br />It needs to reflect what the
					data
					means and explain how it informs a response to the evaluation questions.<br />In order to do this,
					you’ll need to filter and analyze the data.<br />A great way to present an evaluation is through a
					story.<br />Storytelling is the process of turning facts into narrative to communicate something to
					your
					audience.<br />In the next activity, you’ll review data results from the Sauce and Spoon feedback
					surveys and craft presentation slides that tell the story of your evaluation.<br />Then you’ll wrap
					up
					the section with a retrospective.<br />[MUSIC PLAYING] Retrospectives are an example of quality
					control
					because they help teams adjust and improve processes as needed.<br />Coming up, you’ll learn from
					Peta
					as she facilitates a retrospective.<br />You’ll break down the conversations and extract the details
					you’ll need to build into the retrospective document.<br />Let’s start with a refresher on
					retrospectives.<br />A retrospective, sometimes referred to as a retro, is a workshop or meeting
					that
					gives project teams time to reflect on a project.<br />A retrospective gives you a chance to discuss
					project successes and setbacks and to learn from mistakes.<br />Though retrospectives often happen
					at
					the very end of a project, they’re also a helpful process improvement tool that can and should be
					used
					throughout the project life cycle, especially after reaching a project milestone.<br />For example,
					right after implementing the tablets and testing them with beta users is a great time for a Sauce
					and
					Spoon retrospective.<br />You could celebrate parts of the project that have gone well so far and
					identify opportunities for improvement as the project moves toward upcoming
					milestones.<br />Retrospectives have lots of benefits.<br />They encourage team building by
					providing
					team members with the opportunity to understand different perspectives within the team.<br />They
					also
					facilitate improved collaboration on future projects.<br />And they promote positive changes in
					future
					procedures and processes.<br />Because a retrospective is a specific type of meeting, it’s crucial
					to
					have an agenda to help guide the discussion, organize the meeting, and document learnings.<br />As
					the
					project manager, you need to manage the tone of the conversation, make sure that every team member
					feels
					included, and identify details that’ll be recorded in the retrospective document for future
					reference.<br />In other words, it’s your role to facilitate a respectful and productive
					retrospective
					discussion that recognizes successes and areas for improvement.<br />Let’s recap the main
					ideas.<br />A
					retrospective is a workshop or meeting that gives project teams time to reflect on a
					project.<br />Three
					main purposes of retrospectives are to encourage team building, facilitate improved collaboration,
					and
					promote positive changes.<br />And remember, it’s your role as project manager to facilitate a
					respectful and productive retrospective discussion that recognizes successes and areas for
					improvement.<br />In this next activity, you’ll practice preparing for a retrospective by creating a
					list that includes successes and areas for improvement.<br />Once you’re done with this video,
					you’ll
					observe how Peta interacts with her team members as she conducts the retrospective and add
					information
					to your document.<br />See you soon.<br />[MUSIC PLAYING] In the last video, we reviewed the
					importance
					of retrospectives.<br />Now it’s time to figure out how to deal with the sometimes tricky aspects of
					retrospectives.<br />In this video, I’ll take you through effective techniques you can use to
					address a
					lack of participation during a retrospective.<br />Low participation can prevent a project team from
					making meaningful process improvements.<br />But if you’ve got methods you can rely on to help boost
					participation, you’ll be more prepared to lead any kind of retrospective throughout your career in
					project management.<br />After this video, you’ll review supporting materials that will demonstrate
					how
					Peta handles lack of participation in a retrospective.<br />You’ll be able to identify and add
					several
					new details to your retrospective document.<br />First, let’s just say it.<br />Retrospectives can
					be a
					bit intimidating.<br />When you host a retrospective with your team, you draw attention not only to
					project successes but also to challenges.<br />If a team feels uncomfortable voicing challenges,
					then
					they might not be very eager to participate during a retrospective discussion.<br />So before
					jumping
					into any retrospective, make sure to ask yourself, does your team seem likely to contribute to the
					discussion?<br />If you feel like the answer might be no, follow along as we discuss a few useful
					techniques we use at Google to encourage participation in a retrospective.<br />One technique I use
					frequently to encourage participation is to create a safe environment for the team.<br />To create a
					safe environment, you might open the meeting by adopting a policy of what’s said here stays
					here.<br />What’s learned here leaves.<br />Remind the team that the retrospective is a meeting free
					from stakeholders or customers and that it’s a safe space where the team can speak directly about
					problems.<br />To help increase participation, it can also be helpful to model the kind of
					participation
					you’d like to elicit from your team.<br />So if you’re trying to help your team feel comfortable
					speaking candidly about project successes and challenges, you could set the tone by starting the
					discussion with your own successes and challenges.<br />Before the meeting, try preparing a few
					examples
					of tasks or processes you know you could have handled better.<br />If you know that you made a
					mistake
					on a project task, say it out loud.<br />For example, maybe you made a paperwork error that slowed
					down
					tablet delivery by two business days.<br />Be honest about your mistake, and talk about how you’ll
					avoid
					similar errors going forward.<br />When you admit to your own mistakes, you make it OK for the rest
					of
					your team to share their mistakes too.<br />Another useful technique to encourage participation is
					to
					pose a group question and ask for individual responses.<br />For example, you could ask your team
					members to each think of one success and one challenge from the project so far.<br />Then ask each
					team
					member to share their responses.<br />If you find that a question you’ve asked doesn’t get the kind
					of
					response you’d hoped for, try phrasing it in a different way.<br />For example, if questions like
					what
					went well and what went wrong don’t get you the responses you’d like, try alternatives.<br />Maybe
					ask
					something like, what about this project should we start, stop, and continue?<br />And finally, if
					your
					team is participating but contributing only very recent successes and challenges, it may be helpful
					to
					review the project timeline.<br />This is a technique for encouraging teammates to think further
					back in
					the project life cycle to identify successes and challenges.<br />If you remind your team of the
					project
					timeline, you can refresh their memories and spark more discussion about the entire
					project.<br />Let’s
					do a quick recap.<br />Low participation during a retrospective can prevent a project team from
					making
					meaningful process improvements.<br />Some effective techniques to encourage participation include,
					establish a safe environment for the team, model the kind of participation you’d like to elicit from
					your team, pose a group question and ask for individual responses, and review the project
					timeline.<br />[MUSIC PLAYING] In this video, I’ll share some techniques for encouraging
					accountability
					during a retrospective.<br />Accountability refers to being responsible for decisions associated
					with a
					project or task.<br />Accountability is a really important part of a productive
					retrospective.<br />If a
					retrospective is meant to serve as a helpful tool for process improvement, then participants in the
					retrospective need to be honest about how the team could have performed better.<br />Only then can
					the
					team figure out how to improve in the future.<br />Knowing how to push a team to take accountability
					for
					a given project will be a huge benefit to you in your career.<br />After this video, you’ll review
					supporting materials that demonstrate how Peta handles individual and team accountability in a
					retrospective.<br />Then you’ll identify and add new details to your retrospective
					document.<br />Before
					we move on, I want to make one point clear.<br />Accountability and blame are two very different
					things.<br />And only accountability belongs in a retrospective.<br />Blame shuts people down
					instead of
					empowering them to share honestly.<br />Accountability doesn’t involve assigning blame to specific
					team
					members for mistakes.<br />Instead, it encourages the team to think holistically about mistakes and
					challenges and identifies solutions for the future.<br />Another benefit of accountability is that
					it
					encourages ownership.<br />When a team member feels ownership over an aspect of the project, they
					may be
					more motivated throughout the project to ensure that aspect meets quality standards and helps the
					project progress towards the goal.<br />So let’s discuss some great techniques you can use to
					encourage
					accountability during a retrospective.<br />One technique I like to use is to come prepared with
					specific challenges to discuss as a group.<br />This can be especially helpful if you find that your
					team wants to focus discussion only on project successes.<br />To encourage accountability, call
					attention to a specific challenge.<br />Maybe the Sauce and Spoon kitchen managers provided feedback
					that they felt left out of decisions made by the general managers.<br />During a retrospective, you
					might share this feedback with the group and ask the team to help figure out problems that led to
					this
					feedback.<br />Another useful technique is to turn team complaints into SMART action
					items.<br />You’ve
					learned that project goals should be SMART, which means that they’re Specific, Measurable,
					Attainable,
					Relevant, and Time-bound.<br />But here’s another tip.<br />Action items can be SMART too.<br />If
					you
					find that your team does more complaining than problem-solving, pick a complaint and turn it into a
					SMART action item.<br />For example, let’s go back to our example where the kitchen managers feel
					out of
					the loop on general decision-making.<br />As a project manager, it might be a good idea to add an
					action
					item to invite the kitchen manager to the weekly staff check-in meetings.<br />If you want to take
					it
					one step further, you can even add a five-minute agenda item for the kitchen manager to discuss
					issues
					and get feedback.<br />Then you can make a plan to check in two months to find out if they’re still
					feeling this way or if they feel more included.<br />By showing your team how to turn complaints
					into
					action, you can help your team become more solution-oriented.<br />When it comes to encouraging
					accountability, it’s also a good idea to push the team to identify its role in creating a given
					challenge.<br />Your team might seem inclined to focus only on challenges they feel they had no
					control
					or influence over, like a late delivery from your tablet supplier, for example.<br />When discussing
					challenges that the team seems reluctant to take responsibility for, you can help your team think
					about
					the series of events that led to a given challenge.<br />Then you might push your team to identify a
					moment in that series of events when they missed an opportunity to recognize and address the
					problem.<br />Let’s go back to the tablet supplier delivery issue.<br />Maybe if someone on the team
					had
					been assigned the responsibility of managing the tablet supplier vendor early on in the project,
					they
					might have set up weekly check-in calls with the vendor.<br />This could have given the restaurants
					the
					foresight to plan for and work around the missed delivery.<br />When you help your team identify its
					own
					role in creating challenges, you encourage reflection that might lead to helpful insights and ideas
					for
					process improvements.<br />As your team talks about various challenges they faced, make sure
					criticism
					remains constructive.<br />Constructive criticism is a respectful form of feedback that is intended
					to
					help the recipient improve a piece of work.<br />If criticism of a portion of the project begins to
					go
					from constructive to unhelpful or harsh, it’ll be your role as the project manager to redirect the
					conversation.<br />To change the subject, try to detach the challenge being discussed from any
					specific
					person in the room.<br />You can do this by steering the conversation toward process improvements
					that
					the entire team can learn from.<br />Let’s review the main ideas.<br />Accountability and blame are
					two
					very different things.<br />And only accountability belongs in a retrospective.<br />Accountability
					refers to being responsible for decisions associated with a project or task.<br />Accountability is
					about encouraging the team to think holistically about mistakes and challenges and encouraging
					ownership.<br />[MUSIC PLAYING] In this video, you’ll learn how to address negativity in a
					retrospective.<br />Thoughtfully handling negativity is an important skill you’ll need in order to
					effectively lead productive discussions in the future.<br />The ability to guide discussions that
					break
					down project performance while maintaining a constructive and positive tone will help you identify
					and
					improve problem areas of a specific project.<br />After this video, you’ll observe Peta carefully
					handle
					negativity as she leads a retrospective.<br />Then you’ll apply similar techniques as you wrap up
					your
					own retrospective document.<br />Before you do your own retrospective, it’s important to ask
					yourself,
					is this conversation likely to feel stressful for the team?<br />Sometimes, the answer will be
					yes.<br />Let’s talk about why negativity sometimes comes up during retrospective
					discussions.<br />Retrospectives are a great way to build trust, honesty, and direct communication
					with
					the team.<br />But keep in mind, if the environment doesn’t feel psychologically safe to the team,
					it’s
					very easy for a retrospective to turn negative.<br />Negativity can make it more difficult to hold a
					productive discussion that identifies solutions to project challenges.<br />If you sense subtle or
					even
					obvious negativity during a retrospective discussion, here are some techniques you can use to change
					the
					tone of the meeting and guide the team toward a more positive outlook.<br />To address team
					negativity,
					aim to set a positive tone at the start of the meeting.<br />Kick off by highlighting project
					successes.<br />Maybe the team received positive feedback from a stakeholder.<br />Or you could
					thank
					the team for their hard work in reaching a major milestone.<br />Determine how you’ll set the tone
					of
					the meeting.<br />Meeting props can help with this.<br />For example, you might hand out an even
					number
					of green and red index cards to each participant and ask attendees to write successes on the green
					cards
					and challenges on the red cards.<br />Passing out green cards might subtly encourage the team to
					think
					of successes in addition to challenges.<br />Even on teams with a generally positive overall
					dynamic,
					it’s always possible for negativity to come up.<br />So it might be a good idea to try anticipating
					any
					potential negativity by meeting one on one with team members before the retrospective
					happens.<br />If
					you get the feeling that one team member is likely to bring a negative attitude to the
					retrospective,
					try asking yourself a few questions.<br />Does this person feel insecure about the value they add to
					this team?<br />Does this person receive negative feedback on the quality of their
					work?<br />Understanding the root of the negativity can help you figure out how to help the person
					engage with the group in a more positive way.<br />For example, if you sense the person is feeling
					insecure, you could try reassuring them of their value.<br />A single negative voice can derail
					otherwise productive discussions.<br />As the retrospective leader, it’s your role to step in when
					one
					person’s negativity dominates the conversation.<br />To deal with negative participation from an
					individual team member, consider asking team members individually to share their
					thoughts.<br />Calling
					on team members individually does a few things.<br />It gives each person room to share
					challenges.<br />It helps them model solution-oriented thinking for their negative team
					member.<br />And
					it discourages the negative team member from dominating the conversation by responding to every
					question.<br />Finally, you might call a meeting break.<br />A timeout is a great way to help
					de-escalate the situation.<br />It’s good to remember that there’s no single technique that fits
					every
					scenario.<br />How you choose to address negativity will depend on the situation.<br />Let’s
					review.<br />To address negativity during a retrospective, you can aim to set a positive tone at the
					start of the meeting, determine how you’ll set the tone of the meeting, consider asking individual
					team
					members to share their thoughts rather than posing questions to the group, or call a meeting
					break.<br />ROWENA: Congratulations on finishing this video in the Google Project Management
