				<p id="1cf468a0-53d4-813c-813e-eae8138db7ac" class="">SPEAKER: To start, I’ve got a question for
					you.<br />How many open roles do you think are out there for project managers?<br />Hint– the answer
					is
					a very big number.<br />Project managers are in high demand.<br />In 2017, a study by the Project
					Management Institute found that by the year 2027, employers will need 87.7 million people filling
					project management-aligned roles.<br />According to that same study, the industries with the most
					growth
					are manufacturing and construction, information services and publishing, management and professional
					services, finance and insurance, utilities, and oil and gas.<br />Project management plays a big
					part in
					helping all of these industries grow.<br />In some industries, you’ll find the term “project
					manager”
					grouped with a more industry-specific qualifying word– for example, construction project manager or
					IT
					project manager or engineering project manager.<br />Don’t worry, these are all still project
					manager
					roles.<br />They’re just specific to an industry.<br />And it’s important to keep in mind that the
					skills you learn in one industry can be applied to another industry.<br />New projects are popping
					up
					every single day.<br />Across all industries, we notice that new technology is introduced, which
					leads
					to processes changing and a need to manage those processes.<br />So all kinds of companies need
					people
					like you who can tackle a variety of projects from start to finish to help them navigate these
					changes.<br />By now, you might have noticed that you already have some of those skills, like
					organizing
					or planning an event, problem-solving, or even managing a budget.<br />And you use them effectively
					in
					your everyday life.<br />Reflect on some of those skills we mentioned earlier and ask yourself, what
					are
					some of the parts of project management that you’re drawn to?<br />While you may not have the answer
					just yet, thinking about these things can help you find suitable roles later.<br />As you keep going
					in
					this program, try to keep track of the lessons and activities you prefer and the ones you didn’t
					like as
					much.<br />This will help you narrow your choices as you search through job boards later.<br />The
					beauty of project management is that you don’t need to be an expert on a focused technical
					topic.<br />You just need to be able to manage projects.<br />You could be a construction or
					technology
					project manager, or you could enter the health care industry and work in patient
					management.<br />You
					could also enter the energy sector and act as an environmental project manager.<br />The
					possibilities
					are almost endless.<br />What’s equally exciting is that you could even end up with a completely
					different title altogether.<br />For instance, there are roles that entail a sequence of ongoing
					projects that are considered programs or operations in the industry.<br />In this case, the role may
					not
					be described as a project manager, but instead something a little more evergreen, like operations
					manager or program manager.<br />Other titles that might make sense for you could include operations
					assistant, project assistant, project coordinator, and program assistant.<br />When it comes to job
					duties, your responsibilities might change depending on the type of company you choose.<br />For
					example, the workload and specific tasks at a small agency will be different from those at
					Google.<br />It’s also important to keep in mind that as the world continues to change and evolve,
					so do
					industries and the job opportunities you’ll find there.<br />So be sure to cast a wide
					net.<br />You’ll
					be able to find more and more jobs you’re qualified for.<br />In addition to being qualified for
					project
					management-related jobs, there’s plenty of other roles or paths that may interest
					you.<br />Internships
					can sometimes be a good place to start.<br />An internship is a short-term way to get hands-on
					experience in an industry.<br />Plus, internships are a great way to help boost your resume and set
					yourself apart from other candidates.<br />One of the key benefits of internships is that you get
					real
					work experience while simultaneously networking with people in that industry.<br />It’s a
					win-win.<br />Now, some internships in your field might not technically be project manager
					roles.<br />But a lot of roles are easily transferable.<br />For example, something like an events
					manager intern role can become a full-time project manager position later on.<br />Internships
					aren’t
					great for everyone’s lifestyle, but if you can make them work, they’re a fantastic
					option.<br />Another
					path you can take is contract work.<br />Working for companies on a contract means you’ll work with
					them
					on a project-by-project basis, but you won’t be a full-time employee.<br />This kind of work is a
					great
					way to get your foot in the door and build your portfolio.<br />Plus, it gives you the flexibility
					to
					try your hand at a few different projects at once, depending on the commitment level required for
					that.<br />Another benefit of contracting is that it lets you explore different kinds of companies
					and
					project types.<br />Since it’s a temporary position, you can explore what type of company is the
					best
					fit for you.<br />Maybe you find you like working with a large or a small team, or you find you
					enjoy
					specific types of projects.<br />And if you find a situation that suits you and the organization,
					your
					contract position might just lead to a full-time position.<br />As you keep charging forward, try
					thinking about the type of job you might be interested in going after when we’re done
					here.<br />Every
					new topic you discover brings you one step closer to your first role in project management and one
					step
					closer to where you want to be.<br />It’s no secret that job searching can be a challenge.<br />Even
					the
					most detailed, specific job listings can leave you wondering what the company is really seeking in a
					candidate.<br />Don’t worry, we’ve all been there, and we’re here to help you sort through the lingo
					and
					the confusion.<br />The more job listings you find, the more buzzwords you’ll likely notice too–
					words
					like data-driven, team player, self-starter.<br />Understanding all the buzzwords in job listings
					will
					help figure out if a job is right for you.<br />Up to now, we’ve discussed project management as a
					role.<br />But many companies actually list it as a skill.<br />The Project Management Institute
					estimates that every year, there are 500,000 jobs that list project management as a
					skill.<br />Here’s
					some more good news.<br />You’ll soon be qualified for a position as a project manager and a
					position
					that lists project management as a skill.<br />Here’s the even better news.<br />If you have the
					skills
					to manage projects, you’ll be qualified for program manager or operational roles that require you to
					manage an end-to-end system or department, too, which ask for the same skill set.<br />Now, let’s
					check
					out different types of jobs that use your project management skills.<br />When job hunting, keep
					your
					options open.<br />As I just mentioned, you don’t have to limit yourself to just project manager
					titles.<br />There’s lots of other titles you’re qualified for too.<br />You’ll know what’s a good
					fit
					for you by reading the job descriptions, so cast a wide net.<br />Depending on the field you choose,
					you
					might find roles like operations manager, program manager, operations associate, or project
					assistant.<br />All of these could be a great fit for your skills.<br />For example, let’s say
					you’re
					searching a job board for project management roles when you notice a community operations manager
					role
					for a small city open up.<br />The job title isn’t project manager, but you’ll notice that the job
					functions match your skill set.<br />And years of experience also match the job
					requirements.<br />The
					job description may include a list of required skills like organizational management, strong
					planning
					and communication skills, budget preparation and monitoring.<br />Sound familiar?<br />Maybe you’ll
					even
					start to notice that the job’s responsibilities seem like tasks you’ve covered in this course, like
					creating monthly status reports, helping to implement new and necessary technologies, tracking work
					plans and performance metrics, assisting other members of the operations team on given projects, and
					ensuring timely responses to requests for information.<br />These duties are nearly a perfect match
					for
					your project management skills.<br />And there are plenty more listings like these too.<br />How
					great
					is that?<br />The skills that go into project management are used in all kinds of roles and
					professions.<br />Believe it or not, we’ve all worked with or learned from a project manager at some
					point in the past.<br />Can you guess who that is?<br />Your teachers.<br />Think about
					it.<br />Everything that goes into being a teacher takes project management skills– designing a
					curriculum that’s accessible to students with unique needs; managing a budget; communicating with
					others, like parents, department heads, or school admins; developing processes to make things run
					efficiently in the classroom; and so on.<br />For example, when I went for my first interview at
					Google,
					I highlighted my experience as the founder and advisor to a student leadership group.<br />I told
					them
					about how I assembled and led a team of 20 students to plan and execute events like fundraisers,
					community gatherings, and academic assemblies for over 300 students during the academic year.<br />I
					even kind of surprised myself, looking back at how much relevant project management experience I
					had.<br />Now, I’m sure you’ll think back on your own experiences and feel the same thing.<br />One
					more
					thing to call out is networking.<br />Networking is when you meet other people in a professional
					setting
					with the goal of learning, sharing knowledge, and creating new business connections.<br />This plays
					a
					big role in job hunting, so it is a great tool to start learning and perfecting.<br />The skills you
					learn here will prepare you for all kinds of project management jobs.<br />Knowing how to search for
					jobs will make it even easier to match those skills with the best opportunities for you.<br /></p>
