				<p id="1cf468a0-53d4-8105-82ee-c16e6e8fa495" class="">To start, I’ve got a question for you.<br />How
					many
					open roles do you think are out there for project managers?<br />Hint– the answer is a very big
					number.<br />Project managers are in high demand.<br />In 2017, a study by the Project Management
					Institute found that by the year 2027, employers will need 87.7 million people filling project
					management aligned roles.<br />According to that same study, the industries with the most growth are
					manufacturing and construction, information services and publishing, management and professional
					services, finance and insurance utilities, and oil and gas.<br />Project management plays a big part
					in
					helping all of these industries grow.<br />In some industries, you’ll find the term project manager
					grouped with a more industry-specific qualifying word.<br />For example, construction project
					manager or
					IT project manager or engineering project manager.<br />Don’t worry.<br />These are all still
					project
					manager roles.<br />They’re just specific to an industry.<br />And it’s important to keep in mind
					that
					the skills you learn in one industry can be applied to another industry.<br />New projects are
					popping
					up every single day.<br />Across all industries, we notice that new technology is introduced, which
					leads to processes changing and a need to manage those processes.<br />So all kinds of companies
					need
					people like you who can tackle a variety of projects from start to finish to help them navigate
					these
					changes.<br />By now, you might have noticed that you already have some of those skills, like
					organizing
					or planning an event, problem-solving or even managing a budget, and you use them effectively in
					your
					everyday life.<br />Reflect on some of those skills we mentioned earlier and ask yourself, what are
					some
					of the parts of project management that you’re drawn to?<br />While you may not have the answer just
					yet, thinking about these things can help you find suitable roles later.<br />As you keep going in
					this
					program, try to keep track of the lessons and activities you prefer and the ones you didn’t like as
					much.<br />This will help you narrow your choices as you search through job boards later.<br />The
					beauty of project management is that you don’t need to be an expert on a focused technical
					topic.<br />You just need to be able to manage projects.<br />You could be a construction or
					technology
					project manager, or you could enter the health care industry and work in patient
					management.<br />You
					could also enter the energy sector and act as an environmental project manager.<br />The
					possibilities
					are almost endless.<br />What’s equally exciting is that you could even end up with a completely
					different title altogether.<br />For instance, there are roles that entail a sequence of ongoing
					projects that are considered programs or operations in the industry.<br />In this case, the role may
					not
					be described as a project manager, but instead something a little more evergreen, like operations
					manager or program manager.<br />Other titles that might make sense for you could include operations
					assistant, project assistant, project coordinator, and program assistant.<br />When it comes to job
					duties, your responsibilities might change depending on the type of company you choose.<br />For
					example, the workload and specific tasks at a small agency will be different from those at
					Google.<br />It’s also important to keep in mind that as the world continues to change and evolve,
					so do
					industries and the job opportunities you’ll find there.<br />So be sure to cast a wide
					net.<br />You’ll
					be able to find more and more jobs you’re qualified for.<br />In addition to being qualified for
					project
					management-related jobs, there’s plenty of other roles or paths that may interest
					you.<br />Internships
					can sometimes be a good place to start.<br />An internship is a short-term way to get hands on
					experience in an industry.<br />Plus internships are a great way to help boost your resume and set
					yourself apart from other candidates.<br />One of the key benefits of internships is that you get
					real
					work experience while simultaneously networking with people in that industry.<br />It’s a
					win-win.<br />Now, some internships in your field might not technically be project manager roles,
					but a
					lot of roles are easily transferable.<br />For example, something like an events manager intern role
					can
					become a full time project manager position later on.<br />Internships aren’t great for everyone’s
					lifestyle, but if you can make them work, they’re a fantastic option.<br />Another path you can take
					is
					contract work.<br />Working for companies on a contract means you’ll work with them on a project by
					project basis, but you won’t be a full time employee.<br />This kind of work is a great way to get
					your
					foot in the door and build your portfolio, plus it gives you the flexibility to try your hand at a
					few
					different projects at once, depending on the commitment level required for that.<br />Another
					benefit of
					contracting is that it lets you explore different kinds of companies and project types.<br />Since
					it’s
					a temporary position, you can explore what type of company is the best fit for you.<br />Maybe you
					find
					you like working with a large or a small team, or you find you enjoy specific types of
					projects.<br />And if you find a situation that suits you and the organization, your contract
					position
					might just lead to a full time position.<br />As you keep charging forward, try thinking about the
					type
					of job you might be interested in going after.<br />When we’re done here, every new topic you
					discover
					brings you one step closer to your first role in project management and one step closer to where you
					want to be.<br /></p>
