					Dominguez ramireza empezemos  foreign hello I'm Kyle and today today I am going to talk about
					how to develop self-love okay how to develop love love for yourself okay it's important to love
					yourself if you do not love yourself nobody else can love you okay you can't love anybody else first
					first and most importantly you have to love yourself so I think that there are several there are
					several okay there are several things that you can do to improve the love the love that you have for
					yourself okay the first thing the first thing that I want to talk about is to take care of yourself
					physically okay take care of yourself physically when you love somebody when you love somebody that
					when you love someone you have to take care of them so if you want to love yourself take care of
					yourself okay if you don't do it who will so some ways that you can take care of yourself physically
					to show yourself some love is to exercise okay to exercise I think that we should try to exercise
					somehow every day okay so you can go you can go to the gym and lift weights okay you could go to the
					gym and lift weights that's one way that you can exercise go for a nice walk okay you go for a run
					go play basketball okay but I think that you should be moving moving and exercising every day okay
					maybe it's dancing maybe it's running maybe it's swimming okay but you should exercise because
					exercising makes you feel good makes your body feel good and it will help you to look good okay the
					second thing that I think is important to take care of yourself is to eat healthy food okay healthy
					food don't eat things with a lot of sugar or drink pop don't drink too much Pepsi or Coca-Cola
					things like that okay drink eat real food real good food okay you will feel a lot better the third
					thing that I think you can do to feel better about yourself physically is to get a nice haircut get
					a nice haircut okay me I like my hair like this okay I like my hair when it's like this so when I go
					get a nice haircut I feel good afterwards I feel good okay uh yeah it costs some money but it is an
					investment okay and I think that if you want to show yourself some love you should invest your money
					and you okay so getting a nice haircut can make you feel good okay make you feel good about yourself
					okay now those are the physical things physical things are not the most important things okay so now
					let's get to the Deep stuff the important stuff okay the first thing I want to talk about about
					improving your the love that you have for yourself is you need you need you need to speak your mind
					okay it's important that you speak your mind So speaking your mind means that you say how you really
					feel okay you say what you're really thinking so if you do not want to do something and someone says
					hey do you want to come do this this do you want to do this and you do not want to do it say no okay
					say no the truth is always the best option say no and sometimes it's hard to say no but it is
					important to learn how to say no so saying no is important but also saying what you do want saying
					what you do one is important okay and speaking up speak up means to say what you really feel and
					what you're thinking so this could be if you have a boyfriend or a girlfriend and uh you know you
					never say what you really want to do you just do what they want to do that's not showing yourself
					love that's not self-love okay you have to say what you want to do too I want to do this I want to
					eat um this okay I want to watch this it's important that you speak your mind all right tell your
					opinions all right don't let people push you around okay and always just say okay okay okay no you
					have an opinion and your opinion is good just as good as my opinion okay so say it okay now this one
					is very important very important now you should not let people push you around and be mean to you
					and treat you bad but it's also important that you treat everyone the way that you want to be
					treated okay this is called the Golden Rule treat others how you want to be treated okay and this is
					very important very important it's important that you show love to others as well okay if you don't
					show a love to others you can't love yourself if you don't like other people or you hate other
					people you can't love yourself like I said in the last video about my dad hate is like a poison for
					you okay get that stuff out of here hate is no good get hate out of here show love show love to
					people be kind okay be kind be nice when you be nice to other people and you treat other people like
					they are important they will treat you the same way okay so I read I read in a book that you should
					treat other people like they are the most important person in the world okay because in their mind
					they are so if you treat everybody who you meet with respect everybody's going to treat you with
					respect to now the next thing I want to talk about that to me is so important so so important is to
					read later okay for me for me it is so important that I read books about positivity about success
					okay that I read books about people that I admire okay because if when you read books are like food
					for your brain okay and a friend of mine said you are what you consume okay you are what you consume
					so consume good books about positivity okay I read tons of books about positivity and I think
					positive thoughts because all day long I'm consuming positivity okay these are some of the books
					that I read okay I've read all these books so positive Books Okay books about success positivity
					okay books about learning how to speak to other people and how to treat people okay these books
					books about happiness okay happiness these books things like that are great for you and when you
					read books you read books about people that you admire you learn how they think okay you learn the
					things that they did to become happy to become successful when you read these things you'll start to
					think that way okay like this I read this book by Daniel Aviv because I respect Daniel Aviv I admire
					Daniel Aviv and I would like to know how he thinks so that I could maybe start to think that way and
					find out how he became successful and maybe I can use some of the things that he did okay so uh a
					big part of loving yourself is not only eating and consuming healthy food but consuming healthy
					Books Okay healthy content like videos movies good things though not bad things not stranger things
					where people are getting killed okay so what do you read what do you read Facebook Twitter noticias
					malas what do you read my friends read something good read something positive okay now this one this
					next one that I am going to talk about is so so important okay I think that everybody needs to have
					a purpose okay when you have a purpose you know what you are doing with your life okay you're making
					goals and you are going after them you're achieving them when you start to achieve the goals that
					you made you start to feel good about yourself you start to respect yourself you start to love
					yourself okay you start to think things like wow I did this I did this goal so now I can do that one
					I know that I could do that I know I am capable of achieving what I want because I'm smart okay I'm
					strong you should be thinking these things my friends because you are all right you are if you are
					watching this video you're trying to work on your English okay you've got goals in your life you are
					good you are strong you're smart start to think those things all right you have to respect yourself
					you have to respect yourself before others will respect you all right so love yourself okay so maybe
					you are thinking well yeah I'm working on my English but I do not know what my purpose is what my
					goals are okay it's hard to think of what my goals are okay so what I want you to do is think to
					think about what kind of person do you respect okay what kind of person do you admire what kind of
					person would you dream to be all right and then you can start working towards that goal I wanted to
					be somebody who could speak a bunch of different languages all right and have awesome conversations
					with people from all over the world okay I wanted to be somebody who could help other people all
					right maybe inspire people help people to reach their goals so I started to work towards these
					things all right and I work towards them every day so think about think about what kind of person do
					you want to be all right what do you want to do with your life and every day take another step okay
					take another step towards your goals another step towards the person that you want to be and as you
					are working towards being the person that you want to be you will start to respect yourself for the
					hard work that you've done you will start to love yourself my friends thank you so much for watching
					 thank you foreign
