					Hello. Are you ready to improve your English? Well, today you are inside of my garbage can and I am
					going to make you a video of comprehensible input.<br>
					What is comprehensible input?<br>
					Comprehensible input is when a native speaker like me speaks in a way that you can understand. I'm
					going to make a video showing you all of the chores. the chores that people do at their homes all
					around the world. But first, I have to take out the trash.<br>
					Let's go.<br>
					Hey guys, it is your English speakaking friend Kyle and today we've got a video full of important
					vocabulary.<br>
					Today I'm going to make you guys a video showing you something that we all have to do, but I think
					most of us don't really like doing. Chores. What are chores? Chores are the things that you do
					around your house to keep your house clean, to make sure that you have a nice place to live. But for
					most of us, it's not really a fun thing. People don't usually say, "Ooh, I get to do chores today."
					No, it's more like ah I have to do chores today. But it is an important part of daily life. So today
					I'm going to be showing you all the chores that we do around the house, how to say them in English.
					And I think that the camera wife is really going to love this video because she's going to get to
					see me doing chores. All right. This is a vacuum cleaner. This is a vacuum cleaner, guys.
					And you use a vacuum cleaner to vacuum.<br>
					Okay? And what the vacuum cleaner does is it sucks. It sucks little pieces of dirt, animal hair, any
					little thing that's on your floor. The vacuum cleaner sucks those things up. It sucks them into here
					and then you can take this off and throw it away and get it off of your floor. So, the vacuum
					cleaner is for cleaning the floor. Now, there's another thing that is for getting little things up
					off of your floor for cleaning your floor as well. That is a broom. This is called a broom. And this
					is called a dustpan. And you use a broom to sweep to sweep. So, if they kind of do the same thing,
					when do you use a broom and when do you use a vacuum cleaner? Good question. So, you can use a
					vacuum cleaner on a wood floor like this, a floor made out of wood, or on a rug or a carpet. This is
					a rug. The difference between a rug and a carpet is that a rug only covers part of the floor. You
					put a rug down on the floor. A carpet covers the whole floor in the house or the room. So, when
					you're trying to clean up the wood floor, you can use the broom and the dust pan and sweep it up to
					sweep to sweep up the dirt or you can use the vacuum cleaner to vacuum up the dirt. But you cannot
					use a broom to sweep up a carpet. It doesn't work. So, for that reason, you can use the vacuum
					cleaner. camera wife's going to love this. Right now, I am vacuuming our rug and vacuuming our rug.
					Okay. Now, another thing that is very common when cleaning floors is to mop. This is called a mop,
					and you use it to mop. The verb is to mop the floor. But camera wife does a very good job with that.
					She already did it. So, I'm not going to make a mess with a bunch of water and a mop just to show
					you guys. But just know that's a mop and you do not use a mop on rugs or carpets. Okay? Mm- never
					mop your carpet. All right, guys. If you have seen really any of my videos, you know, you know that
					I love I love to cook. But the problem with cooking is that it makes one chore in your house a lot
					more difficult.<br>
					doing the dishes, cleaning the dishes, washing the dishes. There's a lot of ways to say it, but when
					we're talking about cleaning the dishes, the pots, the bowls, the glasses, spoons, we usually just
					say doing the dishes.<br>
					Okay? You could say, "I have to wash the dishes." But in my house, usually we say, "Oh man, now I
					have to do the dishes." All that means is that you're going to clean all of the things that you use
					to cook and to eat. One tip, one way to use your chore time better is to listen, listen to some
					English or anything you want to learn about while you're doing your chores. That's something I
					always do whenever I'm doing chores.<br>
					Many times I've washed the dishes listening to a podcast in Spanish or French or about anything that
					I was trying to learn. So guys, use your time wisely. You'll be surprised how much that little bit
					of extra time can really make a difference. All right guys, now to do dishes, you need soap, water,
					and some people use sponges.<br>
					Some people use washcloths.
					We use this brush usually and whenever the the brush part gets dirty, you can take it off and put a
					new one on. So, we put a little bit of soap on the brush and then you brush the soap on, clean off
					any food that's on there. Then you rinse it with water. Then you got a clean plate. Now, some people
					wash their dishes and then dry them off with a towel very quickly. But we have this this little rack
					over here and you put the dishes standing up like this and the water slowly comes off of it and they
					dry just being out in the open in the air. So that's pretty cool. That's doing the dishes, guys. And
					unfortunately in this house because we cook so much, we have a lot of dishes. But I wouldn't change
					that for the world. You guys saw the fast food video I made on that day.<br>
					There were no dishes. But I did not feel good. So, I'll keep doing the dishes.<br>
					Well, to be honest, camera wife does more dishes than I do. I'm lucky. All right, guys. Here I am in
					camera wife and my bedroom. Okay. And as you could see, the bed is a mess. Okay. If camera wife
					comes home and sees that I left the bed like this, she's going to be mad.<br>
					She's going to be so mad at me. Just kidding, guys. But if your bed looks like this, there's a chore
					that you can do to make your bed look nice. Do you know what that chore is called? Making your bed.
					And this is how you make your bed. You put your pillows, your pillows up here where your head goes.
					This is called the comforter. This part is called a sheet. And camera wife likes it when the sheet
					is nice and tight like this.<br>
					She's going to be happy when she sees this video that I'm doing this cuz a lot of times I don't do
					it. And then you take the comforter, put it nice across the bed. All right, guys. There's probably
					ways to make your bed a lot nicer. Some people will do something like this. I don't really care that
					much about it. I think it looks okay like this. And I just am happy to come home after a hard day of
					work, have a nice clean bed to lay down in and sleep in.<br>
					That's a made bed. Okay, making your bed. So, you probably want to tell your children sometimes,
					hey, go clean your room and make your bed. Make your bed.<br>
					Guys, something interesting I want to say. There's a book about this that I saw before. It's
					something about making your bed is the title of the book. The importance of making your bed or
					something like that. But the idea is that when you make your bed, right when you get up, when you
					wake up in the morning, if you start your day by making your bed, your day will be much more
					organized, much more ordered. And I don't know, I don't make my bed every day, but I have a
					wonderful partner who does help me. So, that's the cool thing about being married, guys. When you
					have your weaknesses, your partner can help you, and you can help them with their weaknesses to be a
					strong team together.<br>
					All right, now time to do some clothes.<br>
					Do you guys know what this thing is called? I have no idea how to say this in any other language.
					So, I'm sure that many of you do not know how to say this in English. This is called a clothes
					hamper, but we usually just call it a hamper. And you put your dirty clothes inside. Okay? put your
					dirty clothes inside here so that you can carry them to your washing machine or wherever you clean
					your clothes. So, let's go check that out. I'll show you all the vocabulary you need to know in
					order to clean your clothes. Chores. Chores.<br>
					Chores. All right, guys. We are down here in my basement. The basement is the part of some houses
					that's underneath the main floor. Okay, the main floor is where we were. We were up there where I
					showed you the vacuum where I was sweeping the floor. That's above me right now. Right now we are
					down in the basement. Okay. And we are down in the basement because that's where the washing machine
					and the dryer are in this house. So guys, washing machine.<br>
					This is the washing machine. You open this. You open the lid. You put what do they call this?
					Detergent. So you open the lid. You put some soap or some detergent in, close the lid, turn it on,
					water starts going in there, and then it starts spinning around and washing your clothes. Now, it's
					really cool that we have washing machines. If we didn't have washing machines, it would be much more
					difficult to wash your clothes. You'd have to scrub and scrub and scrub in a a sink in your bathtub.
					I've heard of people doing their clothes in bathtubs and one time I had to do some laundry in a
					bathtub because the washing machine broke at my old house. So, I know a lot of people still probably
					don't have these around the world, but I'm happy that we have one because I know doing laundry
					without having a washing machine, it's not very fun. So, I'm using a word maybe you haven't heard
					before. Doing laundry. To do the laundry. Laundry is another word for your clothes. Cleaning your
					clothes.<br>
					Doing the laundry. Doing the laundry is washing your clothes. And then over here we have the dryer.
					Okay. So, the washing machine washes your clothes. It cleans them. And then you open this. This is
					called the dryer. You throw the clothes in there. Turn it on. Turn the button on. Push the button
					and it starts spinning them and heating them, making them hot so that they dry off. That's why it's
					called a dryer because it dries your clothes. Unfortunately, guys, you can see that we have clothes
					hanging right here because the dryer at this new house, we just got this house not too long ago, our
					dryer does not work. We need to get a new dryer, but dryers are expensive, so we haven't bought one
					yet.<br>
					So, right now, we hang our clothes and let them air dry. Soon, when we have a little bit of extra
					money, we'll get a new dryer so that camera wife can do the clothes and have it a little bit easier.
					So, guys, that's doing laundry. You wash your clothes in a washing machine if you're lucky enough to
					have one. If not, you wash them in a sink, in the bathtub, in a river, wherever you have to do it.
					And then you c you dry the clothes by putting them in a dryer if you're lucky enough to have one, or
					you hang them up and let them dry in the air. It's better to let them dry outside because of the
					wind, but they will also dry if you just hang them up like this. Just takes longer. So guys, that's
					doing the laundry. Okay, my friends. So, those are the chores that I can think of inside of the
					house. Now, we're going to go outside and do a couple chores out there. But the first one is a chore
					that starts in the house and ends outside.<br>
					Taking out the garbage. Taking out the trash. Okay, trash and garbage. They mean the same thing.
					You'll hear both of those words when people are talking about the things that they throw away.
					Okay, garbage. Trash. It goes in the garbage can or in some countries they might say trash bin. All
					right, but here we call this a garbage can. And my garbage can is pretty full. So, it's time for me
					to take out the garbage.<br>
					Take out the trash. So, you take the garbage bag, then we go take it outside.
					Let's take out the trash. All right, guys. Taking out the garbage. This is the garbage can. And it's
					common for there to be a garbage can for things like food, uh, the nasty garbage. Okay?
					And a lot of people here have recycling bins, which is just for plastic, paper, cardboard, and
					glass. And that is the one that I recorded the intro in. So, don't worry. That one is much cleaner.
					And I set it up to where my camera doesn't touch anything nasty. So, just in case you guys were
					thinking, "Oo, this guy's gross." I made sure to do that that opening shot as clean as I possibly
					could. So, we take the garbage out, we put in these garbage cans, and once every week, a garbage
					truck will come and pick it up. So, on that day, we have to take the cans out to the front of the
					house by the street, and we'll call that taking the garbage up or putting the cans out front for the
					garbage truck, something like that. All right, guys. Here we are in my backyard.<br>
					Your backyard is the space outside of your house, the back of your house. I have a pretty good sized
					backyard and I love it because Connor can run around.<br>
					We could come out here and cook food on my grill. It's a very nice space, but it's pretty big and
					there is a lot of grass. And that brings me to the last chore that we're going to talk about today.
					Cutting the grass. Okay. Now, there's different ways to say this.<br>
					Cutting the grass, mowing the lawn. That is my lawn mower. Okay. And it's green because it's
					electric. I thought I would do good and buy an electric lawn mower and it would work great, but it
					doesn't really work that good, guys, because the battery dies very quickly. So, having a big yard
					like this, an electric lawn mower is not very good. But that's called a lawn mower. And you use a
					lawn mower to mow your lawn or cut your grass. So, I'm gonna start up my lawn mower and mow my lawn
					or cut my grass.<br>
					So, some people really enjoy mowing their lawn, taking nice care of their yard, and I enjoy that,
					too, to make my yard look nice, so my family has somewhere nice to be outside. But it can be hot and
					it takes a long time with this big yard and especially when I have to keep on charging my battery on
					my lawn mower. So, I'm going to go ahead and charge I'm going to go ahead and cut my grass. But the
					one thing I do like about this this chore is that one, you can listen to something. You can listen
					to a podcast or something on headphones while you do it, but you also get exercise. And you can see
					I'm getting sun, which is very good for your body and your brain. So guys, I'm going to cut my cut
					my grass real quick and then I have one last thing I want to share with you guys before we end this
					video.<br>
					See you in a minute. All right, guys.<br>
					It's kind of hot out there. I just finished mowing my lawn or cutting my grass. Either of those
					means the same thing. To cut your grass or to mow your lawn. So my my lawn or my yard, which both
					pretty much means the same thing.<br>
					Your lawn is like the grass and the trees and stuff. Your yard is just the space out there outside
					of your house.<br>
					So my yard is looking pretty good now.<br>
					I'm happy. My family has a nice place to be outside. My son loves to go out there and run around. So
					anyway, chores are done. I got some exercise. I got some sun. Now, I just want to share something
					with you guys because I'm excited about it. Let's see. As I'm recording this, it is August 21st,
					okay? And August 28th is my birthday. I will be 34 years old. And we're going to do something cool
					to celebrate my birthday. We're going to go on a little trip, a little vacation, just a small one. 3
					days. And we're not leaving the country, but we're going to see something beautiful, absolutely
					stunning that is here in the United States. We are going to fly from Chicago, close to where I live.
					We're going to fly to Colorado, a state called Colorado. And there's something in Colorado that is
					one of the most beautiful places in all of the United States, one of the natural wonders of my
					country. And I have never seen it. The Rocky Mountains, guys. I cannot wait.<br>
					We're going to see incredible lakes like this. This is a famous lake called Bear Lake. We're going
					to see the mountains.<br>
					We're going to rent a car and drive way up high into the mountains. And I have a lot of things I
					want to do there. And I'm going to make some awesome videos.<br>
					I'm thinking I might wait to make my questions and answer video for when we're there because that
					way it'll give you guys a few days to post good questions for me and I could record the questions
					and answers video with an incredible view behind me. I might just do that because I want to make a
					bunch of content while we're there. So, in a week it will be my birthday. I'll be 20 or 24. I wish
					I'll be 34 years old and we'll be seeing something incredible.<br>
					Me, camera wife, and my son are going to go explore a beautiful part of my country. I'm going to
					show you guys what it looks like, too. Just wanted to share that with you because I'm excited and I
					wanted you guys to know we've got some awesome content coming up here on the channel. So, my
					friends, I hope that you learned some useful vocabulary here about chores. You know, it's it's not
					something super fun, but it's something that we do pretty much every day. So, if you're going to
					live your life in a new language, you've got to know these things. Thank you all for all your
					support, for leaving me your nice comments, for watching my videos, for spending your valuable time
					with me. I appreciate every single one of you. See you in the next video, my friends.
