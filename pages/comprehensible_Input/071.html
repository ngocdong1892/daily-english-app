					Dallas is okay so okay the most outside exciting for me in my opinion living here is uh because I
					travel a lot and I have been in a lot of places but the most important for me is Puerto Rico I went
					with my boyfriend in March or March and um Hawaii and Cancun Mexico that places have the most
					beautiful views I was like like dying like oh wow I never see this with my eyes but okay so I'm so
					grateful for that um that's so fun and then all the really really exciting thing for me is to try
					different kind of food like different like Chinese um I don't know like and assuming don't know pop
					inside but so many kinds of different countries like different creatures like so good I love to eat
					so I'm so happy because I never eat so many kind of food so yeah that's the most excited part for me
					um the most heart I think is of course English um English because I come here for be honest I have I
					can say just hi goodbye why with the patron why not actually so many times months ago I asked always
					the pattern and they say it is what sorry and I feared so uncomfortable but I'm just saying is like
					the accent how you sound like it's so hard sometimes his heart um so something where I really are
					achieve it I achieve it come on um is to make phone calls um so it was so scary like that was so
					scary for me I can't do it I I was like no I I don't wanna call I can't understand what they say and
					then when I talk um they was like uh what do you say I'm sorry I can't understand that was so
					terrifier for me but I overcome so many times because I have to go to the doctor and make
					appointments and explain what's going on so I'm so happy about that um something like is there being
					so hard for me is to go to the restaurant and they yeah I can order my food but the hard part is
					when they ask me for what dress do you like I I even I can't say the words I I even I have no idea
					what kind pan or uh size sizes that has come up um so I know I have to ask and that's Theory being
					like out of your heart but still working on it um in chocolate I want to say uh how the people here
					are more core with even with their families like their families come here and they are spend time
					together and they are happy but when they have to live live they are like okay bye see you another
					day and um that's it they don't they just knows and I was like a weird for me like porque beso now
					um the people are so nice they are so nice and when they don't uh know you like in the neighborhood
					like common business if you are walking with the dog or you are just walking uh and they are and
					they see you they're going to say Hi how are you or or just hi um so that's that's good that's nice
					that's nice that's nice okay I think that's um sure for you and I want you to say everything's hard
					um to come here for me take me to or like about two years but every day I do something and that can
					be possible uh it doesn't matter what is your dream doesn't matter what is your goals um you can
					give if you work hard so everything have a price price talking about money but also uh price talking
					about sacrifices like working hard on it working about what you want and I know that can be possible
					if we really want to care if we really want to do it so yes um I love United States um oh uh
					something where I I really don't like so much and I still like they're being hard for me is the food
					like they can eat sandwich they can eat different things like that and for me still like no I need
					my protein I need my rice I need beans I need lentejas garbanzos como estas so I'm happy and I'm
					good for good for for everything what I have here and it's just a different life um something
					interesting about living here is how you can see like and also meet different people from not just
					for from United States also from different countries like Chinese people Germany alemania
					switzerlands I don't know how you say that but Como suisa Latin people of course and yeah okay so I
					hope you enjoyed the video and yes
