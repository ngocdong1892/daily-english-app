				<p id="1cf468a0-53d4-8158-9531-e8c45c2c2f4d" class="">JUANNE: Hi, there.<br />Welcome.<br />This course
					is
					all about initiating a project successfully.<br />If you haven’t gone through our foundational
					course
					yet, we recommend checking it out.<br />It covers the foundations of project management and contains
					lots of helpful information for anyone wanting to start a career in this field.<br />There are lots
					of
					people around the world like you who are hoping to learn the skills to get a project management
					role.<br />Maybe you’d prefer to take a specialized certification rather than a four-year
					degree.<br />Maybe you’re looking for an affordable way to stand out among competition.<br />Maybe
					you’re interested in changing your career.<br />Whatever your reason for being here, we are glad
					you’ve
					joined us.<br />This program is rooted in the belief that a strong foundation in project management
					can
					help anyone start a great career as a project manager.<br />Before we begin this course, let me
					introduce myself.<br />My name is JuAnne, and I’ll be your instructor for this course.<br />As a
					senior
					program manager at Google for the past eight years, I have worked on cross-functional projects
					involving
					product managers, software engineers, user experience designers, network operations, customer
					support,
					and more to build software used at Google and used by Google Cloud customers.<br />I began my career
					working as a liaison between customers and engineers, documenting requirements on software
					development
					projects.<br />As I became involved in larger projects, I started to manage the timelines of the
					projects and coordinate the work of the different teams that had to get involved to finish the
					project.<br />Before I knew it, I was the de facto project manager.<br />I have accumulated my
					knowledge
					through formal and informal training, finding practical application in finance, insurance, and tech
					companies.<br />I’m super excited to be sharing with you more about the project management
					discipline.<br />During this course, you’ll learn all the steps for kicking off a
					project.<br />We’ll
					start with an overview of initiation, which is the phase that allows ideas to come together and form
					the
					beginnings of a plan for a project.<br />You’ll identify the individual components of initiation,
					like
					the project scope, goals, and deliverables.<br />You’ll also learn how to measure the success of a
					project.<br />This is a super important piece of the puzzle.<br />After all, you want to be able to
					meet
					or exceed all of the requirements for a successful project, right?<br />Later, we’ll talk about how
					to
					identify stakeholders.<br />Stakeholders have a direct interest in the project’s completion and
					success.<br />We’ll teach you about some really helpful tools you can use to define project roles
					and
					responsibilities and more tools and resources you typically need to complete the work of a
					project.<br />Finally, we’ll introduce documentation that can help your team prepare for project
					kickoff.<br />Exciting, right?<br />The skills you’ll learn in this course will help you start
					projects
					of your own.<br />We can’t wait to get into these topics with you.<br />[WHIMSICAL MUSIC] Because
					initiation is the first phase of the project, it’s really important to get it right.<br />A
					well-planned
					initiation results in a strong foundation for your project and sets it up for
					success.<br />Initiation
					begins after a problem or opportunity has been identified within an organization.<br />Often,
					stakeholders like senior leaders at a company will initiate a project to address a specific need for
					the
					business.<br />For example, perhaps the company would like to roll out a new product, improve
					employee
					well-being, or reduce costs in a certain department.<br />It’s your responsibility as the project
					manager to help identify the project goals, resources, and other details based on initial
					discussions
					with the project stakeholders.<br />Even though someone else might come up with an idea for the
					project,
					it’s still your job to figure out all the important pieces that need to come together in order to
					get
					the work done.<br />The initiation phase is a crucial time for asking stakeholders to write
					questions,
					performing research, determining resources, and clearly documenting the key components of a
					project.<br />Doing this will help you solidify the scope or the boundary of the project.<br />If
					this
					seems a bit overwhelming, don’t worry.<br />We’ll talk more about project scope later on in this
					course.<br />If a project isn’t initiated properly, things can go wrong pretty fast.<br />For
					example,
					without sufficient understanding of the project’s goals, you might underestimate what resources you
					need
					or how long the project might take.<br />Or, without agreeing with stakeholders on what success
					looks
					like, you might think the project was completed successfully while the stakeholders might think it
					didn’t accomplish their goals.<br />Getting on the same page and gaining clarity during the
					initiation
					phase can save a lot of time and extra work for everyone throughout the project.<br />Proper
					initiation
					also helps ensure that the benefits of the project outcomes will outweigh the costs of the
					project.<br />To determine this, you’ll do what’s called a cost-benefit analysis, which is the
					process
					of adding up the expected value of a project, the benefits, and comparing them to the dollar
					cost.<br />To do this, you will work with stakeholders to consider a few questions.<br />To
					determine
					the benefits of a project, those questions might include– what value will this project
					create?<br />How
					much money could this project save our organization?<br />How much money will it bring in from
					existing
					customers?<br />How much time will be saved?<br />How will the user experience be improved?<br />And
					to
					determine the costs of a project, those questions might include– how much time will people have to
					spend
					on this project?<br />What will be the one-time costs?<br />Are there any ongoing costs?<br />What
					about
					long-term costs?<br />The benefits of a project should always outweigh the costs.<br />So it’s
					really
					important that you consider these questions early on.<br />Coming up, we’ll talk more about the
					initiation phase and explore the key components of initiating a project.<br />[WHIMSICAL MUSIC]
					There
					are several key components of initiation that you need to consider in order for your project to be
					successful– goals, scope, deliverables, success criteria, stakeholders, and resources.<br />First,
					you
					need to consider the goals of a project.<br />The goal is what you’ve been asked to do and what
					you’re
					trying to achieve.<br />All projects should have clear goals, and often, those will be determined by
					senior company leaders with your help.<br />From there, you would begin to consider the project
					scope.<br />This is the process to define the work that needs to happen to complete the
					project.<br />You also need to consider project deliverables.<br />These are the tangible and
					intangible
					outcomes of a project.<br />Once the goals, scope, and deliverables are determined, you need to
					consider
					success criteria.<br />Success criteria are the standards by which you measure how successful a
					project
					was in reaching its goals.<br />Another important consideration is your
					stakeholders.<br />Stakeholders
					are key to making informed decisions at every step of the project, including the initiation
					phase.<br />They are the people who both have an interest in and are affected by the completion and
					success of a project.<br />As a result, they are often instrumental in determining the goals,
					objectives, deliverables, and success criteria of a project from coming up with the idea, to
					outlining
					their expectations of its results.<br />As you move through the initiation phase, it’s your job to
					ensure that you understand the needs of the project’s stakeholders early on.<br />It’s also your
					role to
					ensure that all stakeholders are in agreement on the goals and overall mission of the project before
					moving on to the next phase.<br />Now, let’s talk about resources.<br />Resources generally refer to
					the
					budget, people, materials, and other items that you’ll have at your disposal.<br />It’s super
					important
					to think carefully about those pieces early on.<br />No one wants to get started on a project only
					to
					realize halfway through that they don’t have enough money or enough people to complete the
					work.<br />That would be a mess.<br />Finally, once you’ve established your goals, scope,
					deliverables,
					success criteria, stakeholders, and resources, it’s time to create a project charter.<br />A project
					charter is a document that contains all the details of a project.<br />Project charters clearly
					define
					the project and its goals and outline what is needed to accomplish them.<br />A project charter
					allows
					you to get organized, set up a framework for what needs to be done, and communicate those details to
					others.<br />Once you’ve drafted the charter, you would then review the document with key
					stakeholders
					to get their approval to move into the planning stage.<br />Coming up, you’ll learn more about
					project
					charters and even get the chance to create one yourself.<br />ROWENA: Congratulations on finishing
