				<p id="1cf468a0-53d4-81f0-8782-c1c97d06458b" class="">Hello.<br />Welcome to this course called
					Planning–
					Putting It All Together.<br />If you’ve already completed our previous courses, then you have a
					great
					foundation for what it takes to initiate a project and kick off the planning phase.<br />Before we
					get
					started, let me introduce myself.<br />My name is Rowena, and I’ll be your instructor for this
					course.<br />I work as a senior program manager in Google Cloud on a variety of projects.<br />I
					mostly
					focus on systems and productivity enhancements for my team, which consists of around 100 full-time
					employees and more than 300 contractors around the world.<br />Some of the larger-scale projects
					that I
					work on impact Google Cloud sales and global sales support teams, which are made up of thousands of
					people.<br />But I didn’t start out building solutions for thousands of people at a global
					company.<br />I left school at the age of 17 with no college degree and no real plan.<br />Before
					Google, I worked in retail, hospitality, and even in the airline industry as a crew
					member.<br />When I
					joined the corporate world, I noticed something.<br />The processes were just as messy as the
					stockrooms
					of the retail stores where I’d worked.<br />There was so much room to improve.<br />I came to
					realize
					that every business is complicated and that there’s always room to create order.<br />So I started
					thinking about ways to automate my day-to-day tasks.<br />I was emailing ideas to my manager and
					colleagues, working with teams across the company, brainstorming solutions to problems, coordinating
					training for my coworkers, and so much more.<br />That’s when it became clear I was project
					managing.<br />I transferred into a role focused entirely on program management at Google’s
					headquarters
					in Mountain View, California.<br />In my job interview, I focused on examples of how I applied these
					transferable skills from my previous roles and how I could leverage the knowledge I gained from my
					experience.<br />Four years later, I’m here, and I’m so excited to be partnering with you on this
					learning journey.<br />From the outside, big, global companies can seem as though they have it all
					figured out.<br />But there’s always room for new processes, and you likely have the skills and
					insights
					from your previous experiences that can be useful.<br />So keep going.<br />You’re heading in the
					right
					direction.<br />This course is focused on the planning phase.<br />I’ll share the tools and
					techniques
					to complete this phase.<br />First up, I’ll demonstrate how to kick off the planning
					phase.<br />Then
					we’ll explore the importance of setting and reaching milestones.<br />For every milestone, there
					will be
					a set of tasks to complete, so I’ll teach you some tips for breaking down and distributing the
					workload.<br />Later, we’ll discuss the budget and how the overall budgeting process
					works.<br />We’ll
					learn about people or companies outside of your organization that may play a role in determining the
					budget.<br />And we’ll discuss the importance of sufficiently documenting your budget.<br />Then
					we’ll
					discuss the various risks and the possible impact those risks can have on the project.<br />Nothing
					ever
					goes quite as planned, but risk management is a great way to make sure you know what could go wrong
					and
					how you’ll address it.<br />This includes communicating possible risks to your stakeholders,
					creating a
					mitigation plan, and then keeping an eye on those risks to make sure they don’t stall your
					projects.<br />Last but not least, documentation ties it all together.<br />Keeping all your project
					plans documented and organized not only helps you, but it also helps those involved knowing their
					responsibilities.<br />Documentation also provides stakeholders with a window into the development
					of
					the project.<br />It has always been important to the success of my own projects at Google, and I’m
					excited to explore this topic with you.<br />[MUSIC PLAYING] In the previous course, you learned
					about
					the initiation phase.<br />During the initiation phase, the project manager is gathering all of the
					necessary preliminary information needed to get stakeholder approval and plan the project.<br />A
					few
					key things need to happen during this time.<br />First, the project manager gets
					assigned.<br />That’s
					you.<br />Then the goals of the project have to be approved, as well as the scope of the project and
					its
					deliverables.<br />A number of people will need to be assigned to the project, and you’ll have a
					good
					sense of their individual roles and responsibilities.<br />You’ll also need stakeholder sign-off on
					your
					project charter.<br />If all of these criteria have been met, then you’re set to begin
					planning.<br />Planning is a significant part of ensuring a project’s success, so let’s take some
					time
					to discuss why it’s so important.<br />Planning is important for any project, large or
					small.<br />While
					planning your project, you and other members of the team will determine the processes and workflows
					needed to meet your goals and put together ideas about how to make the project a success.<br />While
					planning, you might draw from previous project experience, but don’t be afraid to think of new ways
					to
					get results.<br />Every project is different, so new and different approaches may be just the thing
					you
					need.<br />Planning has many benefits.<br />As we’ve discussed, planning helps you map out the full
					project.<br />It helps you understand the work needed to achieve your goals.<br />Planning also
					helps
					coordinate efforts and timelines with other teams, contractors, and vendors.<br />Another huge
					benefit
					of planning is that it gives you time to identify and prepare for risks that could impact your
					project.<br />Those might include things like a delay in the timeline, the departure of a critical
					team
					member, or a change in project direction from a primary stakeholder.<br />Planning also gives you
					the
					chance to brainstorm ways to mitigate or address those risks.<br />There are less obvious benefits
					too.<br />For example, the planning phase can help you get buy-in from key members of the project
					team.<br />Getting buy-in means that you’ve gained their support for your plans.<br />Planning also
					demonstrates to stakeholders that the team is taking care to start the project with a detailed
					plan.<br />But one of the most significant benefits of planning is teamwork, which will help you
					push
					your project across the finish line.<br />By working together in the planning phase, individuals
					assigned to the project can become a strong team by the time the planning is done and the work is
					about
					to start.<br />Planning together creates a shared understanding among all parties involved in the
					project.<br />So, to recap, planning has many benefits, from helping the team to understand the work
					needed to achieve their goals, to providing project plans to the stakeholders.<br />Now that you
					know a
					bit more about planning, we’ll learn how to launch the planning phase.<br />[MUSIC PLAYING] As you
					learned earlier, the planning phase is the second phase of a project’s life cycle.<br />This can be
					a
					challenging time for a project manager because there’s so much to consider.<br />But it’s important
					to
					know that project plans don’t have to be perfect the very first time.<br />And even if you do a
					great
					job with your plans the first time around, it’s likely that the plan will change as the project
					evolves.<br />The planning phase may differ from project to project.<br />But, generally, three big
					things are worked out during this stage– the schedule, the budget, and the risk management
					plan.<br />We’ll discuss each of these in greater detail later on in the course.<br />But for now,
					here’s some general information so you can understand why these three elements are so crucial to
					planning.<br />Let’s start with the schedule.<br />The schedule is basically a timeline of the
					project.<br />It includes the start date, the end date, and the dates for things that will happen in
					between.<br />You’ll use time estimation techniques to determine these dates.<br />Let’s imagine
					scheduling in our example project at Office Green.<br />As a reminder, you’re the lead project
					manager
					for Project Plant Pals, a new service that will provide top clients with desk-friendly
					plants.<br />You
					want to launch the service by the end of the year, so the planning phase for this effort should
					include
					a number of key dates.<br />Those dates might include when you’ll request proposals from plant
					vendors.<br />They might also include the date you’ll kick off with the web designers and developers
					who
					are creating a new website for the service.<br />It should also include important dates during the
					project execution phase, like when the plants need to be ready for delivery or when the new web page
					design needs to be approved.<br />And you’ll need to include the target date for the launch of the
					service.<br />Another part of the planning phase is setting the budget.<br />The budget will account
					for
					the total cost to complete the project.<br />The total cost needs to be broken down to determine how
					much has to be spent on different elements of the project.<br />For Project Plant Pals, the budget
					will
					need to include items like the cost of designing and launching a web page, the cost of hiring your
					plant
					vendor, and much more.<br />The third component of the planning phase is risk management, which
					means
					searching for possible problems and planning ahead to mitigate these risks.<br />Let’s face it– risk
					is
					inevitable in every project.<br />What’s not inevitable is how the risk impacts your
					project.<br />Good
					project planning means searching for places where trouble might occur.<br />Where might the schedule
					get
					off track?<br />Where might the budgets exceed your estimates?<br />You’ll work with your team to
					consider answers to these questions and prepare a risk management plan based on whatever you
					discover.<br />Let’s go back to the Office Green example.<br />While putting together the initial
					schedule, you may realize that your estimates from your developers put you way beyond your launch
					date.<br />To manage that risk, you might try to reduce or adjust the project scope to still meet
					your
					deadline or even negotiate a new launch date with your stakeholders.<br />These are two simple
					examples
					of how you might mitigate a scheduling risk.<br />So, to recap, you’ll spend the planning phase
					building
					your schedule, setting your budget, and preparing your risk management plan.<br />But first, you
					need to
					get the whole team on board.<br />Next, we’ll discuss the project kickoff meeting, which is where
					the
					project really gets going.<br />Meet you there.<br />[MUSIC PLAYING] You might be wondering what a
					kickoff meeting is and how it differs from other types of meetings.<br />That’s a great
					question.<br />A
					project kickoff meeting is the first meeting in which a project team comes together to ground
					everyone
					in a shared vision, gain a shared understanding of the project’s goals and scope, and to understand
					each
					person’s individual roles within the team.<br />So who’s invited to the kickoff meeting?<br />Well,
					that
					would be the team members identified in a RACI chart created during the initiation phase.<br />As a
					reminder, a RACI chart helps to define roles and responsibilities for individuals or teams to ensure
					that the work gets done efficiently.<br />During the kickoff meeting, team members will learn more
					about
					how they’ll contribute to the project and how they’ll gain a deeper understanding of how the team
					will
					work together to reach the project’s goals.<br />You should also invite your stakeholders and your
					sponsor to the meeting so that they have a chance to understand the high-level plan for the project,
					can
					share their perspective, and you can ensure that everyone is on the same page.<br />Now, you might
					be
					wondering, why do I need a kickoff meeting?<br />Can’t my team learn everything they need to know
					from
					the project charter?<br />We get it.<br />Meetings can be time-consuming, and there are definitely
					situations when a quick email or a chat to a teammate will suffice.<br />But when you’re kicking off
					a
					project, especially larger projects with multiple people involved, it’s important to get together to
					establish a shared vision, align on the scope, and build team rapport.<br />This is also an
					opportunity
					for teammates to ask questions and offer insights.<br />And it’s a great time for you to set
					expectations with the team about how each person will individually contribute to the
					project.<br />Now
					let’s discuss how to plan and run a kickoff meeting.<br />There are lots of templates for kickoff
					meeting agendas online, but most follow a similar structure and last about an hour.<br />Keep in
					mind
					that this is just a suggestion, and you should feel free to schedule as much or as little time for
					each
					agenda item according to the needs of your project and the team.<br />Most meetings start with brief
					introductions.<br />You can allocate about 10 minutes for everyone in the group to introduce
					themselves
					and their roles and, if time allows, share a fun fact to help build team rapport.<br />Then you’ll
					spend
					about five minutes giving an overview of the background of the project.<br />This covers details
					like
					how the project came to be and why the project matters.<br />You’ll also use this time to set a
					shared
					vision.<br />Next, spend about five minutes sharing the goals and the scope, which refers to the
					boundaries around a project.<br />That includes making it clear what work is considered in-scope,
					and
					what work is considered out-of-scope.<br />This is also a good place to share the target launch date
					and
					highlight any important milestones the team need to be aware of.<br />Once you’ve covered goals and
					scope, it’s time to discuss everyone’s roles.<br />It’s a good idea to spend about five minutes
					making
					sure that everyone is clear on what work they’ll be responsible for throughout the duration of the
					project.<br />Next, it’s time to address collaboration, which is how the team will work together on
					the
					project.<br />This is a great time to go over tools that’ll serve as a communal source of
					information
					for the team, like a project plan created in a spreadsheet or work management software tool like
					Asana.<br />It’s also a great time to determine how the team will communicate with one another, like
					through daily email updates, a team chat room, and weekly team check-in meetings.<br />You should
					spend
					about 10 minutes on this topic.<br />When that’s all set, it’s time to discuss what comes
					next.<br />Now
					that you’ve discussed the details of the project thus far, you should spend about 10 minutes setting
					expectations with your teammates for what’s coming up.<br />You’ll also use this time to make clear
					to
					each teammate what actions they’ll need to take next.<br />Finally, it’s really important to set
					aside
					about 15 minutes for questions from the group.<br />This is your team’s chance to gain clarity on
					any of
					the topics you’ve discussed so far.<br />It’s also your chance to hear from the team and ensure that
					the
					project is benefiting from diversity of thoughts, experiences, and ideas.<br />For example, in
					addition
					to fielding questions out loud in the meeting, I might invite teammates to input their questions or
					feedback in a shared document.<br />This practice can help create space for collaboration.<br />I
					also
					like to poll my teammates for confidence on the topics discussed that day.<br />I ask what their
					confidence level is on a scale of 1 to 5– 1 being I’m not confident at all, and 5 being I’m
					extremely
					confident.<br />If they’re not confident, I ask them what I can do to help change that.<br />This
					practice can give the team a stronger sense of support because they know I’m there to help them
					through
					roadblocks.<br />If you try this practice in your meetings, be sure to deliver on any promises you
					make
					there.<br />Your reputation as a project manager to get things done and remove roadblocks is
					critical to
					building and maintaining relationships.<br />So, to recap, the kickoff meeting will cover
					introductions,
					project background, goals and scope, roles, collaboration, and what comes next, and the meeting will
					leave time for questions from the group at the end.<br />Once you finalize the meeting agenda,
					document
					this information into a meeting agenda template and send it to attendees a day or two ahead of the
					meeting.<br />As the project manager, you’ll be leading the majority of this meeting.<br />And when
					you’re presenting, it’s difficult to take notes and present at the same time.<br />So at the start
					of
					the meeting, ask a teammate to take notes on key points you discussed throughout the session and to
					record each teammate’s action items.<br />In some cases, it may be beneficial to record this meeting
					so
					that attendees can revisit it later, especially if you have a large or dispersed team.<br />Just be
					sure
					to get each attendee’s permission to record ahead of time.<br />After the meeting, don’t forget to
					send
					a follow-up email to the group summarizing key points and outcomes from the meeting, as well as any
					action items to the attendees.<br />In your follow-up email, be sure to also invite attendees to
					reach
					out if they have any additional questions.<br />While there’s a lot that goes into the kickoff
					meeting,
					remember that this is an exciting moment for the team and especially for you as the project
					manager.<br />All of the careful thinking and hard work that you’ve done during the initiation phase
					comes together to form the foundation of your project.<br />Coming up, we’ll learn about milestones,
					tasks, and how they differ.<br />[MUSIC PLAYING] As we’ve discussed throughout this program, the
					project
					manager is responsible for assigning work to the team and keeping track of the project’s
					progress.<br />When we discuss assigning work, we’ll use a few key terms– project milestones and
					project
					tasks.<br />Let’s break these down.<br />A project milestone is an important point within the
					project
					schedule that indicates progress and usually signifies the completion of a deliverable or phase of
					the
					project.<br />These are significant checkpoints in your project, and keeping track of them helps
					ensure
					that your project is on schedule to meet its goals.<br />For example, a milestone might include
					completing the first draft of a report, and the goal may be to ultimately publish the
					report.<br />Another example of a milestone is receiving sign-off or approval from your customer on
					a
					major deliverable.<br />Let’s discuss how milestones differ from project tasks.<br />A project task
					is
					an activity that needs to be accomplished within a set period of time.<br />The work of a project is
					broken down into many different tasks.<br />In order to reach a milestone, you and your team must
					complete multiple tasks.<br />For example, if a milestone is completing the first draft of a report,
					the
					tasks required to get to that milestone might include hiring a writer, conducting research, and
					drafting
					different sections of the report.<br />Let’s imagine milestones and tasks in the context of Project
					Plant Pals at Office Green.<br />One of your project deliverables is to launch a website for your
					new
					service, where customers will be able to place orders and get customer support.<br />Some of the
					milestones leading up to that launch will include securing approval on the website design and
					implementing feedback from user testing.<br />To achieve those milestones, your team needs to
					complete
					multiple project tasks.<br />For example, in order to reach the design milestone, your website
					designer
					will need to create initial mock-ups of the proposed website design.<br />You will need to review
					those
					mock-ups, and the designer will need to implement your feedback.<br />Each of these items is a
					project
					task, and you won’t reach your milestone until they’re complete.<br />To review, milestones are
					important points within the project schedule.<br />And project tasks are activities that need to be
					accomplished within a set period of time to help reach those milestones.<br />Milestones and project
					tasks are interconnected.<br />Tasks ladder up to milestones, which are crucial for project
					tracking.<br />[MUSIC PLAYING] So you’ve learned that a milestone is an important point within the
					project schedule that highlights progress and usually marks the completion of a deliverable or phase
					in
					the project.<br />But now let’s talk about why setting milestones within your project is so
					important.<br />While it might seem tempting to make a quick to-do list and get on with the project,
					it’s really important that you take the time and effort to break your project down piece by
					piece.<br />Here’s why.<br />First, setting milestones gives you a clear understanding of the amount
					of
					work your project will require.<br />The act of setting milestones forces you to break your project
					down
					into more manageable chunks.<br />The further you go, the better you’ll be able to see how much work
					will be needed to meet the project goals.<br />At first glance, it might seem simple to launch a new
					website, but it might be more work than you think.<br />And if you break that deliverable down into
					milestones and those milestones into tasks, you will have a better sense of the true amount of work
					that
					needs to be done.<br />This will help you better manage the project workload.<br />Another reason
					milestones are so great is that they can help keep your project on track.<br />When you set a
					milestone,
					you assign clear deadlines for when certain project deliverables need to be completed.<br />Then, as
					you
					work through the execution phase, you can look back at these deadlines to make sure that the project
					is
					progressing at the right pace.<br />A third reason you’ll want to set milestones is that they help
					you
					uncover areas where you might need to adjust scope, timelines, or resources to meet your
					goals.<br />For
					example, if you realize that reaching a milestone will require more tasks than you’d anticipated,
					you
					might ask a stakeholder for permission to reduce the scope of the project and cut down on the number
					of
					tasks.<br />And, finally, there’s one more reason milestones are so important.<br />Actually
					reaching
					milestones can seriously motivate your team and illustrate real progress to your
					stakeholders.<br />With
					big projects that go on for months, you’ll want to keep the team’s motivation high.<br />A milestone
					signifies the completion of an important chunk of work and provides a moment of celebration for the
					team, even if there’s more work ahead.<br />Milestones also serve as a great check-in point to
					highlight
					your progress to stakeholders.<br />It gives them the opportunity to see the work that’s been
					completed
					so far and lets them see everything is on track and up to their standards.<br />It’s also important
					to
					remember that milestones must be completed on time and in sequential order because, usually,
					reaching
					the next milestone is dependent on completing a previous milestone.<br />Think about this in terms
					of
					Project Plant Pals at Office Green.<br />As we discussed earlier, in order to launch a website for a
					new
					plant service, there are a few milestones you need to hit, like securing approval of a website
					design,
					completing development of the website, and implementing user feedback.<br />These milestones must
					happen
					in this order.<br />Here’s why.<br />The web developer can’t build the website if the design hasn’t
					been
					approved by stakeholders.<br />And you can’t implement feedback from user testing if there’s no
					website
					to test.<br />So we know it’s important to reach milestones in sequential order.<br />But it’s just
					as
					important that you reach them on time.<br />If the team misses the mark to complete a deliverable
					tied
					to a specific milestone, it could set back your project schedule, meaning your team might need to
					work
					overtime or add additional resources to catch up.<br />For example, if you need to secure
					stakeholder
					approval on a website design by Friday, but the web designer hasn’t completed the design yet, you
					might
					have to wait until after the weekend to secure stakeholder approval.<br />This will delay the start
					of
					the development phase, giving your team less time to build the website.<br />Even worse, this delay
					could affect the project budget if completing this deliverable directly ties to a payment from the
					client.<br />If you miss the deadline, you’ll likely delay receipt of that payment.<br />You might
					even
					risk losing the payment altogether.<br />Though deadlines are sometimes flexible it’s important to
					be
					extra mindful of milestones where the deadline is non-negotiable.<br />[MUSIC PLAYING] OK, so you
					know
					that milestones are pretty important.<br />They help give you a clear picture of the amount of work
					required.<br />They help your project stay on track, uncover areas where you might need additional
					resources, motivate your teammates, and show progress to your stakeholders.<br />So now let’s talk
					about
					identifying milestones within your project and how you can set deadlines for each one.<br />The
					first
					step to setting a milestone is to evaluate your project as a whole.<br />It helps to refer back to
					your
					project charter to remind yourself of the project goal.<br />Then make a list of what your team
					needs to
					do to achieve that goal.<br />The big items that indicate progress are your milestones.<br />These
					are
					the key points within the project schedule that signify the completion of a project deliverable or a
					phase in the project.<br />Smaller items, like any item that a stakeholder wouldn’t need to review,
					for
					example, are tasks.<br />You’ll plan for these once you’ve separated them out from the
					milestones.<br />So let’s go back to our Office Green example.<br />One of the project deliverables
					is a
					new website, and as we determined earlier, some milestones for our Office Green website scenario
					include
					securing approval of website design, completing development of the website, and implementing user
					feedback.<br />Mocking up initial designs or building a landing page are smaller items on your list,
					so
					those are marked as tasks.<br />Try to keep in mind that some projects might have many milestones,
					while
					others might just have two or three.<br />There’s no one right number of milestones to set.<br />The
					number will vary from project to project.<br />Once you’ve determined your milestones, the next step
					is
					to assign each one a deadline.<br />Reaching each of your milestones is dependent on the completion
					of
					multiple project tasks.<br />So to make sure you give your team a fair amount of time to complete
					each
					of those tasks, you’ll need to space your milestones out accordingly.<br />For a larger,
					month’s-long
					project like Project Plant Pals, you shouldn’t expect to meet multiple milestones in the span of a
					week.<br />Mocking up website designs and collecting insights from user testing are big tasks that
					take
					time.<br />You need to space milestones out to give your team room to complete their work.<br />To
					get a
					good sense of timing, you can connect with teammates to discuss the tasks required to reach each
					milestone and get their estimates for how long these tasks will take.<br />With those estimates in
					mind,
					you can make an informed decision about reasonable deadlines for each milestone.<br />When you set
					deadlines for milestones, you’ll also want to consider the needs of your stakeholders.<br />Ask
					yourself
					when they’ll expect to see a certain project deliverable, and consider the answer when choosing a
					deadline.<br />Your stakeholders will want to see regular indications that the team is making
					progress,
					and milestones are a great way to show that progress.<br />So, to recap, you set milestones by
					looking
					at your project as a whole and pulling out important checkpoints that show progress.<br />Then you
					assign deadlines to each milestone while keeping the needs of your stakeholders top of
					mind.<br />[MUSIC
					PLAYING] So we’ve discussed how to set milestones.<br />Now we’ll learn how to account for the many
					tasks that ladder up to each milestone.<br />You can do this by creating a work breakdown
					structure.<br />Let’s start with a definition.<br />A work breakdown structure, often abbreviated to
					WBS, is a tool that sorts the milestones and tasks of a project in a hierarchy in the order they
					need to
					be completed.<br />This is a helpful tool because it helps break down the sometimes intimidating
					challenges of a project into more manageable chunks.<br />Big projects, like publishing a report or
					organizing a conference, seem a lot less daunting when the work required to get there is broken down
					step by step, with a clear pathway from the beginning of the project to the end.<br />Let’s look at
					an
					example of a basic work breakdown structure.<br />There are lots of different ways to design a work
					breakdown structure, but one common way is to create a tree diagram of project tasks.<br />Let’s say
					that we’re creating a work breakdown structure for the Project Plant Pals website launch.<br />At
					the
					top of the diagram is the name of the project.<br />The second level of our diagram breaks the
					project
					down into three milestones.<br />These include securing design approval, developing the site, and
					implementing user feedback.<br />At the third level of the chart, we can see each of those
					milestones
					gets further broken down into a series of project tasks.<br />For example, tasks listed beneath your
					design approval milestone include mocking up designs and collecting feedback.<br />This is a very
					simple
					example of a work breakdown structure.<br />Here, we’ve only created a work breakdown structure for
					a
					new website, which is just one of the Project Plant Pals’ deliverables.<br />Keep in mind that in
					future
					project management roles, you’ll likely create a WBS that outlines the tasks for an entire
					project.<br />It’s also important to note that while creating a work breakdown structure is a
					helpful
					exercise for visualizing the tasks of a project, you wouldn’t typically include this type of diagram
					in
					your official project plan.<br />Instead, you’d input the tasks identified through this exercise
					into a
					spreadsheet or your chosen work management software, where you can more easily assign owners to each
					task.<br />OK, so after completing a work breakdown structure and organizing those tasks in a
					spreadsheet, a few things should be clearer to you.<br />First, you should have a set of discrete
					project tasks that ladder up to each of your milestones.<br />You and your teammates will know
					exactly
					what needs to happen to reach your first milestone and the milestones after that.<br />Second,
					you’re
					now in a good position to assign those tasks to members of the project team.<br />Each person should
					have a clear understanding of the tasks they own and the order in which they need to complete
					them.<br />Let’s break down how to assign tasks.<br />Tasks are typically assigned according to a
					person’s role in the project.<br />For example, in our Office Green scenario, the web designer is
					assigned to the task of mocking up the initial website design.<br />You are assigned to the task of
					reviewing that design and providing feedback.<br />And the designer is assigned to the task of
					implementing your feedback.<br />A web developer will be assigned to the next task of developing the
					site itself.<br />Sometimes, your team will have multiple teammates working in the same type of
					role.<br />To assign tasks between two or more team members with the same roles, you might take into
					consideration each person’s familiarity with the tasks at hand.<br />For example, if you have
					multiple
					web developers working on the new website, you might task one developer with creating the landing
					page
					and task the other developer with creating the Contact Us page.<br />When assigning tasks, you
					should
					also consider each teammate’s workload.<br />Think about how much time they’re meant to be spending
					on
					the project compared to work outside the project that they might also be responsible for.<br />It’s
					important to keep everyone’s workloads balanced.<br />You’ll want to make sure that a single
					teammate
					isn’t assigned more work than others.<br />You’ll also want to make sure that no one is assigned
					more
					work than they can handle.<br />When people feel overloaded, the quality of their work may
					suffer.<br />Or they might need more time to complete the number of tasks, putting the timeline and
					the
					overall project schedule at risk.<br />As the project manager, you’ll ensure that your teammates are
					clear on their assigned tasks.<br />You can do this by assigning tasks with help from project
					management
					tools, like Asana, which I use a lot in my day-to-day role at Google.<br />When you manage a project
					in
					Asana, you’ll add tasks to represent actionable pieces of work needed to complete the
					project.<br />As a
					best practice, it’s good to start each task with a verb.<br />For example, instead of just typing
					“website,” make clear the task is to mock up the website or add images to the website.<br />Another
					thing to think about when assigning tasks is timeline.<br />Be sure to add an assignee and a due
					date to
					each task so it’s clear who’s doing what by when.<br />Finally, be sure to include as much detail
					surrounding the task as possible to avoid miscommunication.<br />In Asana, you can click into the
					task
					details to add helpful information.<br />Here you can add a description, link to corresponding files
					or
					attachments, or even comment on the work related to the task.<br />There’s so many benefits to
					assigning
					tasks, but the biggest one is that it frees you up to focus on managing the project.<br />This way,
					you
					can feel confident in the knowledge that your teammates are responsible for specific work.<br />But
					there’s also some less obvious benefits of assigning tasks.<br />Let’s explore these more
					now.<br />One
					less obvious benefit of assigning tasks is that it creates a sense of personal responsibility for
					members of the team.<br />When you assign a teammate to a task, you enter into an agreement with
					that
					person that they’ll own the task until it’s completed.<br />Creating a sense of ownership for
					members of
					the team is important because it makes them feel more invested in the project.<br />It also gives
					them
					space for personal growth, plus it supports your own skill-building as a manager who’s a supportive
					delegator.<br />And on top of that, it keeps your team motivated and invested in completing their
					work
					on time.<br />And while each team member should have a sense of responsibility for their assigned
					task,
					a complete sense of ownership might feel overwhelming for some teammates.<br />If that’s the case,
					it’s
					a good idea for a project manager to encourage teammates to support one another on their
					tasks.<br />This is also great for building overall team rapport.<br />Congratulations on finishing
