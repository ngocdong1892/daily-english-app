					Hello my friends i am kyle here in my channel panzano english my mission is to help you
					with your english okay today today we are going to speak in intermediate english okay i am going to
					speak slower than i speak with my friends but i am not going to use pictures okay to help you so
					this is going to be a little bit more difficult but i know that you can do it okay today we are
					going to talk about breakups what is a breakup okay so a breakup is if you are in a relationship
					with somebody okay you have a boyfriend you have a girlfriend you have a husband you have a wife and
					the two of you break up okay you break up your girlfriend leaves you your boyfriend says i do not
					want to be with you anymore we we are going to break up okay um and breakups happen breakups happen
					breakups are sad okay breakups are sad but but sometimes they could be a good thing today we are
					going to talk all about breakups so there are many reasons many reasons why people break up the
					first reason cheating okay what is cheating what is cheating okay cheating is if for example i have
					a girlfriend if i have a girlfriend and i go and start kissing a different girl a different girl who
					is not my girlfriend that's cheating okay so a lot of people break up because their partner cheated
					on them getting cheated on sucks and being a cheater sucks so do not do it the second reason second
					reason that a lot of people break up fighting fighting i don't like you you're dumb you're always
					doing dumb things you can't do anything right okay if you and your boyfriend or your girlfriend
					always fight you always fight when you talk oh you're wrong you're wrong i'm right you're wrong okay
					if you always fight when you talk maybe you will break up because of fighting okay fighting is not
					healthy it is not healthy in a relationship so if you're in a relationship and you're always
					fighting maybe it is best to end it or maybe you could try not fighting sometimes other people are
					right the third reason the third reason that people sometimes break up differences okay what are
					differences all right in a relationship maybe i'm christian okay maybe i'm a religious person and
					maybe my girlfriend is an atheist okay maybe i am religious and i pray i pray okay i pray i believe
					in god and jesus okay and then what if my girlfriend is atheist atheist means that a person does not
					does not believe in god is not religious okay that's a difference that's a big difference some
					people break up because of big differences another example is differences in politics okay political
					views uh for example in 2016 2016 when donald trump was running for president a lot of people a lot
					of people fought they fought over whether you like donald trump or if you hate donald trump okay so
					for example for example if your girlfriend your girlfriend is a democrat okay um or your boyfriend
					your girlfriend or your boyfriend is a democrat so joe biden's a democrat hillary clinton is a
					democrat barack obama is a democrat okay your girlfriend your girlfriend or your boyfriend as a
					democrat and you you say well i like donald trump your girlfriend or boyfriend will probably break
					up with you the fourth reason the fourth reason that sometimes people break up uh this one i'm going
					to warn you this one is for adults okay adultos i'm an adult i'm an adult if you are not an adult do
					not listen to this next one okay but this is for adults sometimes people break up because of bad sex
					okay bad sex sex is making love okay bad sex so if the sex is bad if the sex is bad and maybe you
					don't do things that your boyfriend or your girlfriend likes or they do not do things that you like
					sometimes people break up because of bad sex so now what do people do after they get dumped do you
					know that word dumped okay if you get dumped it means that your boyfriend or your girlfriend leaves
					you okay if your boyfriend or your girlfriend leaves you you my friend you got dumped okay you got
					dumped but if you leave if you leave your boyfriend or your girlfriend you are dumping them okay so
					if they leave if the other person leaves you got dumped if you leave you dumped them you dumped them
					get out of my life i'm dumping you but what do most people do what do most people do after after
					they get dumped okay well the first thing the first thing that most people do after they get dumb
					they cry they cry okay they cry because it hurts it hurts to get dumped okay uh it really does hurt
					so have you ever cried after getting dunked i haven't because i'm a man i'm a man so i don't cry but
					after getting dumped a lot of people cry it hurts when you love somebody and they leave it hurts
					another thing another thing that a lot of people do after getting dumped is drink they drink alcohol
					okay um because it hurts it hurts to get dumped a lot of people drink alcohol they drink so that
					they forget okay they want to forget about the person who they love okay oh i still love her i still
					love her it hurts so bad but but drinking cuckoo is not a real solution it only makes things worse
					so my advice and my opinion is if you get dumped it's okay it's okay to cry it's okay to cry don't
					go get drunk no don't go get drunk the third thing that a lot of people do after getting dumped they
					go they go and look for somebody new they go right away and start looking for somebody new they look
					for somebody new because people people like us people don't like to be alone okay people don't want
					to be alone so they go and look they go look for new people so uh sometimes if a guy gets dumped
					he'll go to the bar and look for new girls okay or if a girl gets dumped she'll go look for guys or
					whatever you like a lot of times after people break up they go and look for somebody new right away
					those were three things that i think are not good they're not good to do after a breakup now i am
					going to give you my tips okay my tips of what you should do tips consejos my tips of what you
					should do what you should do after a breakup i think that you should learn new things you should
					learn new things okay you should learn new things because when you learn new things you're not
					thinking you are not thinking about oh i loved her oh i miss him okay you're not thinking about that
					other person you go and do new things new cool things okay you find new hobbies all right you start
					playing guitar or accordion okay or you learn how to box okay you learn new things you go learn new
					things it is good it is good to go learn new things after getting dumped okay the second thing that
					i think you should do uh after you break up with somebody is spend time with your friends okay
					because a lot of times when we are in a relationship we're in love we're happy we spend most of our
					time with our boyfriend or girlfriend okay and sometimes you don't see your friends a lot anymore so
					i think you should go you should go and talk with your friends laugh you can talk about your ex oh
					man she cheated on me she cheated on me and she left okay you can uh complain to your friends okay
					you can complain to your friends your friends will listen to you oh yeah bro you're right she's no
					good i knew i knew she was no good bro you're better than that you're gonna find someone better okay
					good friends help good friends can help the third thing the third thing that i think you should do
					after a breakup is exercise okay exercise go do exercise go to the gym work out go run yeah okay
					because when you exercise you'll look better you look better looking yeah okay you'll look better
					and you'll feel better so i think i think that after you can have a relationship you should go work
					out go work out get sexy okay make yourself better alright you make yourself better and your ex is
					going to regret leaving you after getting dumped what i think you should do make yourself better
					improve okay make yourself better in all ways okay try and get a good job get a better job make more
					money okay go uh exercise go start new hobbies go make new friends meet cool people do cool things
					go places have fun okay do new things try new things make yourself better and you will be happy
					again so we we talked about reasons why people break up we talked about the normal things that
					people do after getting dumped and we talked we talked about what i think you should do after
					getting dumped okay take it from me i have experience i have experience okay i have loved and i have
					lost breakups are hard breakups are hard breakups are sad breakups hurt sometimes after a breakup it
					feels like your life is over feels like the end of your life oh i can't live without her i can't
					live without him my life is over i don't want to live okay but it's not life's not over you can meet
					someone new meet someone better or you can be happy with yourself so if you get dumped use it as an
					opportunity to make yourself better learn some english okay live your life yeah and then you can
					make post on facebook in english about your ex and she won't know what you're talking about she
					won't understand she'll be like look at this person they think they they think they're so cool
