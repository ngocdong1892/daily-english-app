					in this video I am going to share five strategies that I have personally used to stop translating in
					my head and you can use them to finally start thinking in English are you  ready hey guys
					welcome to pensando Eng I am Kyle and I am an enthusiastic language learner but more importantly
					than learning a language I have lived it I have made incredible relationships and had experiences
					that I will never forget all because one day I decided to start learning Spanish so here on the
					channel my goal is to help you improve your English so that you can start living it start to have
					these incredible experiences and enrich your life so let's get right to it the first strategy that I
					have personally used to stop translating in my head and that you can use to start thinking in
					English is talk to yourself speak to yourself now first first let me say you should probably do this
					when you are all alone and there are not other people around you don't do this one in public because
					people will think that you are crazy just joking about that guys but this is something that you can
					do every day guys you can do this when you are walking or driving to work when you are working out
					or when you're walking your dog because probably your dog won't judge you when I first started
					learning Spanish guys this one helped me out so much and every day when I was driving to work and
					when I was driving home from work I would talk to myself I would talk to myself about how my day was
					okay what I did at work who I had a conversation with what I ate anything but it's important that
					you start practicing expressing yourself you can give yourself interviews pretend that you are
					interviewing for a new job you can pretend your favorite English YouTuber is interviewing you for
					their Channel and asking you personal questions it doesn't matter what you talk about guys what
					matters is you start practicing expressing yourself start making those connections between the
					thoughts and feelings that you want to express and actually saying the words the stronger that these
					connections become in your brain the quicker you will be able to express yourself and the less you
					will have to think about it so guys talk to yourself today number two read in English guys all that
					a book really is is thoughts written down all of those words are the thoughts of somebody so when
					you start to consume those thoughts they start to become your thoughts you start to see how
					sentences and paragraphs are structured in the language that you are trying to learn and not only is
					reading an incredible way one of the best ways to learn new vocab ulary but you can literally find a
					book or an article about anything that interests you so if you can work on your English and become a
					smarter person in general I consider that a win when you're just starting out you could start with
					children's books about stories that you already know in your native language and as you progress you
					can get bigger and bigger books until one day you're reading about rocket science reading is one of
					the best ways to get your brain into English mode reading is awesome and awesome people read period
					number three write in a journal in English once again guys this is all about strengthening the
					connections in your brain between the thoughts that you want to express and the words in your new
					language and the more you practice the faster your brain can find the correct words without having
					to think and translate in your head now guys when I was first starting out on my Spanish journey I
					was doing this as well I wouldn't do it every day but I would do it after I had a fun weekend with
					some friends I would write about the good food that I ate the fun places that I went the cool movie
					that I watched keeping a journal is an excellent way to practice expressing yourself but also later
					when you speak really good English it is always fun to go back and look at your Journal again and
					think wow I have come such a long way I found my old Journal where I was writing in Spanish and I
					thought wow I made so many mistakes back then that I don't make now and you know what I was proud of
					all the hard work that I've put in so guys keeping a journal is a great way to help yourself start
					thinking in English strengthening those connections in your brain and documenting your English
					learning Journey hey guys it's Kyle here just a quick message I just want to tell you that if you do
					not like And subscribe to the channel right now there's a 93% chance that you will spend the next 5
					years of your life in a cold place like this it's really your decision though all right let's get
					back to the video number four stop being scared of making mistakes just let it come out let it all
					come out part of being human is that we care what other people think about us right we want
					everybody to think that we are cool that we are smart that we do really good at everything we do it
					is very hard for us to admit hey I'm just learning I'm going to make mistakes but I'm going to keep
					trying and there was a quote guys that I heard one time and it said if you are not brave enough to
					be really bad at something when you start you will never be great at it so guys you have to stop
					worrying about making mistakes and just express yourself okay and the thing is guys everybody is not
					judging you you are judging yourself stop it you're awesome in order to show you guys that we all
					make mistakes and it happens and sometimes it can even be funny and it might be a funny story later
					I want to share a quick story with you guys so when I was learning Spanish it was during Co okay and
					everybody was scared people were wearing mask okay nobody wanted to shake hands or hug I was at
					somebody's home and this person only spoke Spanish so I normally would go and shake their hand so I
					wanted to ask them are you afraid of Co or are you still shaking hands okay so what I wanted to say
					was was TI but what I said was TI mistakes happen guys stop being scared of them Express Yourself
					freely and number five the last and most important spend as much of your entertainment time as you
					can in English the most important thing when you are learning a language is to just Dive Right In to
					Dive Right In and immerse yourself surround yourself with the Lang language right now this is great
					if you find yourself in a country where everybody is speaking that language but the reality is that
					some of us will not get the opportunity to spend months or years in a place surrounded by native
					speakers of the language that we are trying to learn and it's likely that we will have to learn it
					by ourselves at home most of the time right let's be real most of us spend a lot of time watching
					shows watching movies listening to music or a podcast or just wasting time scrolling on social media
					I am guilty of all of these things so please believe me guys I am not judging you I am not judging
					however one of the most valuable things that I have learned during my language learning journey is
					that I can use my entertainment time to help me progress with my language learning goals so instead
					instead of binge watching a show in English on Netflix I would find an awesome show in Spanish
					instead and watch that all day I searched for Spanish-speaking YouTubers who talked about things I
					enjoy such as cooking or exercise and I figured if I'm going to watch content about cooking or
					exercise anyway why not watch it in Spanish and kill two birds with one stone the really cool part
					about it is if you turn your entertainment time into fun learning time you no longer have to feel
					guilty about sitting around watching the TV all day if you watch a show in your native language for
					6 hours you are lazy guys you're lazy you're being a bum but if you watch it in the language that
					you are trying to learn mhm you are productive you are investing time in learning it's pretty cool
					how that works believe me start turning your entertainment time into Fun engaging learning time and
					you will not believe how fast you will be thinking in and speaking English like a pro okay my
					friends
