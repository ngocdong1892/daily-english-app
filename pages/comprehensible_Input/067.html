					soy foreign [Music] [Music] okay and the Samos Adelante [Music] the most basic question to ask when
					you want to know about someone's hobby is what are your hobbies so Kyle what are your hobbies okay I
					have many hobbies I've tried to do a lot of different things because you never know what you're
					going to like until you try it right so I I like to try a lot of things but the things that I have
					tried and really liked that I do almost every day or most days I really enjoy martial arts uh I
					practice jiu jitsu one time two times three times every week I really enjoy that a lot I love to
					make videos on YouTube I love to talk with people from all over the world from different cultures in
					their languages and my next hobby language learning I love to learn new languages I think it's like
					having a superpower being able to speak to somebody in their language so that's uh those are the
					things that I do pretty much every day and then I have some other little things that I sprinkle in
					here and there how about you Emma words and exercise I'm also a very active person so I love sports
					I like yoga a lot so I do yoga every day pretty much I try to do maybe 10 15 minutes of yoga and
					also just walking with my dogs I walk with my dogs every day twice a day because I have to but also
					because I love them and I like I like going out and playing and walking with them so I like to be
					active and take care of my body and my physical health and yes talking about travel as well I love
					to travel and I have been to a few different countries so I feel very fortunate to have traveled and
					also I'm planning on doing a lot more traveling in the future so I love to meet people from
					different cultures like Kyle and I like to talk to different people in different languages obviously
					English Spanish or Portuguese and learn about their cultures so one way that I do this is by going
					to language exchanges so I don't know if we have many of these in the U.S at least in Seattle we
					don't that I know of but here in Sevilla in Spain we have many different language exchange groups
					where we can go to like a local bar and just chat with people from all over the world like French
					people Brazilian people people from Portugal people from Morocco people from all over and we just
					chat 10 minutes English 10 minutes in Spanish 10 minutes in in Portuguese for me or French so that's
					really cool a cool way to meet people and to practice languages okay I'm super jealous of that
					because I haven't seen anything like that in my city or maybe in Chicago which is kind of close to
					my city but I would have to drive for like an hour uh but I would absolutely love to have a place
					where I could go and speak my Spanish or French uh but sadly we don't have that so I know that at
					least you used to really enjoy dancing are you still dancing regularly yeah so I dance every week I
					try hip-hop dance for the past few weeks and I like it but Bachata will always have my heart and
					salsa so I'm starting this week with Bachata so I love to dance and yes I dance once or twice a week
					and of course in my room I put on my music and just dance around the house that too so yes I still
					dance often and that's probably my top Hobby okay super cool I would love to get into that right now
					I I wouldn't say I know how to dance I've been known to dance on occasion but maybe not very well
					how's your Rhythm do you have rhythm oh for sure yeah you you commented on my video where I talked
					about being a rapper so we've got a little bit of Rhythm right so I'm still waiting to hear that
					song is it out on the internet I'll send you a link but you can't share it okay I'll be looking
					forward to that all right so let's talk about a few more Hobbies I know that you're a person that
					has so many hobbies and you're just a person that's curious and you love to explore and try new
					things are there any other hobbies that you have tried or that you do regularly so my girlfriend and
					I have been playing tennis in the last few months uh we both find that really enjoyable we make
					stupid bets like if I win you have to give me a massage or if I win you have to buy sushi afterwards
					and it makes it so fun uh you get out in the sun breathe in fresh air running around and one other
					thing that I've been doing lately that um I feel has been so useful and helpful for me personally is
					meditating and I've never been able to do it like you know you kind of need to have a plan you can't
					just sit down and say I'm gonna meditate so I've been completely relaxing my body thinking okay my
					my legs are relaxed my back my arms and then I start thinking about the positive things my goals
					what I'm trying to achieve and I find that to be just a a wonderful way to spend an hour 30 minutes
					20 minutes if you've only got 20 minutes and I I come out of it just smiling and so happy and uh I I
					wish I would have started doing this a lot earlier but it's something I've been doing in the last
					few weeks at the beginning of summer so maybe three months ago for those of you who aren't watching
					in summer but three months ago I started meditating and I wouldn't say it's a hobby of mine but it's
					a habit that I'm trying to put into my life because of course I want to be mentally what could you
					say healthy so yeah same thing just trying to do 10 15 minutes a day for me in the morning and just
					relax my body and be aware and present in the moment so again a habit not a hobby for me but still
					very beneficial and speaking about fresh air one of them my biggest Hobbies is definitely hiking for
					sure I grew up in the Pacific Northwest you know Washington and Oregon that zone has tons of forests
					and mountains so we just love it we love going to the mountains and Hiking being in nature that is
					so important to me so unfortunately here in Sevilla for anyone who's aware of this Zone it's very
					dry so we don't have many forests we don't have many mountains so that's what I'm missing about home
					but yes one of my biggest Hobbies is getting out in nature and hiking definitely okay um yeah I
					think being in nature kind of goes along with the meditating and uh it's almost a meditation in
					itself just to walk outside see Nature's Beauty and I like to add nature to another hobby that I
					enjoy which is running I I really I would rather run on a nice Trail in a forest with beautiful
					trees flowers the air smells good that's so much more satisfying to me than running on a treadmill
					inside yeah absolutely and speaking about being in nature and doing sport one thing I love is
					kayaking have you ever tried kayaking I bought a kayak two years ago and I've used it probably three
					or four times so I I do find it super satisfying but it's kind of a pain for me to carry this big
					kayak around so that's the only thing right yeah I back in Seattle I had a kayak big blue kayak
					alone I'd have to have help to put it on my car tie it on my car and then drive out to the lake or
					to the river but that is just an amazing thing that I started I actually started kayaking when I was
					in Ecuador so I started doing kayaking and rafting and you know Ecuador is like all like almost half
					of the countries in the Amazon rainforest so or secondary rainforest so you're like in the jungle
					just with these amazing surroundings in the River kayaking and it was just one of those moments that
					makes you feel alive you know just makes you feel like life is amazing there's so much Adventure out
					there so definitely yeah kayaking is awesome and in the Pacific Northwest we have so many so many
					rivers so much water we have ocean right we have the beach there so you can see all kinds of
					Landscapes there and on the kayak just being out in the middle of the lake like surrounded by Mother
					Nature yeah yeah amazing yeah um sure you know another hobby that I've I've started recently that I
					find so satisfying is I've been raising baby chickens right so what really no okay that's a joke but
					oh my God what listen I I really do want to raise chickens and like take good care of them and then
					I have eggs and stuff because I do have a garden so gardening is sort of something I've gotten into
					a little bit and I do find that super peaceful and uh I really want some chickens but for right now
					I haven't bought any chickens yet yeah no I think that would be super good to have your fresh often
					they lay eggs but have your fresh batch of eggs every morning you know super healthy and yeah it's
					always nice taking care of another being I actually started getting plants so I have plants and you
					know it's not easy for me at least because I never really grew up with plants in my home that I was
					constantly taking care of so you have to learn how much water they need how much sunlight they need
					and then of course people say you have to like talk to them and sing to them and stuff I don't know
					if it's true but I'm trying to take good care of my plants so planting is another thing that I kind
					of got into sure yeah that's cool peaceful yeah definitely and they're still alive right so you're
					doing well most of them are still alive I will say that there have been some Fallen Soldiers what I
					mean is that some of them have died but you know most of them are still alive Okay so um you you
					mentioned that you should sing to your plants that is something that I have always kind of wanted to
					try I would love to take singing lessons because I can't sing very well I would love to be able to
					sing my sister sings beautifully she has the voice of an angel I am tone deaf I I cannot sing so
					maybe one day I'll take singing lessons as a hobby right I'll sing we can make candy good yeah
					you're right about that everybody can sing that's that's the positivity right yeah yeah definitely
					you know speaking about music I love listening to music so another hobby is to be in the kitchen
					cooking and just listening to my music or but what I would love to do really is to learn to play the
					piano or the guitar so I know it's never too late but you know with all these responsibilities it
					seems like there's so much stuff that I I will never have time for so that's fair you know maybe one
					day I'll get into that yeah where there's a will there's a way if you you want to do something you
					could definitely do it um a hobby that I had in the past but I really don't do anymore I I know how
					to play the guitar but I really don't do it anymore just because I have so many other things that
					I'm kind of juggling um and I it it doesn't make me as happy as it used to I would rather spend my
					time learning a language I feel like that's a better investment of my time right now yeah definitely
					but I know that you're somehow involved in music because of all these rap tracks that you have so
					are you still rapping no no no no I I don't still rap uh but you know what I I recently I I have
					been playing around with the idea of trying to write a song in Spanish like a rap song in Spanish
					like oh yeah or uh Spanish hip-hop just kind of test my vocabulary and uh Mastery of Spanish but I
					it's been several years since I've wrapped our recorded song but uh that was something that was
					super enjoyable to me I met so many new people and it was it's something satisfying about writing
					about your problems getting it off of your chest we say which getting something off your chest means
					to talk about it and uh feel that relief from the stress so if I had problems I would write a song
					about it and I would feel so much better so I think that music is a worthwhile Hobby and it's a
					beautiful way that humans can express themselves right it's very creative I think anything related
					to art and creativity is very necessary for humans whether or not we think that we're good at it
					right A lot of people are like oh I can't paint I can't draw I can't sing but it's just a matter of
					trying right just trying you don't have to do it any good just see it as therapy yeah for sure so
					are there any hobbies that you have never tried but would like to try other than piano or guitar
					yeah yeah that I tried once but I would love to have it as a hobby and do it continuously is rock
					climbing rock climbing is super cool it's a little bit scary to be honest because I actually did it
					out in nature so I was like climbing a little shirt mountain and that was a little bit scary but I
					would love to try rock climbing again maybe join a rock climbing club or something and another one
					related to that is oh no totally Timothy we'll cut we'll cut that out I'm putting it in mine you can
					cut it out of yours I totally what the hell it's just gone okay what about you is there any hobby
					that you would like to try okay so you know that I'm a father I have a seven-year-old son he wants
					to do something and I think it might be kind of cool my son right now he loves insects like ants
					bees butterflies he's crazy about insects right now and he wants to raise some bees and we could
					make our own honey whoa yeah that's cool I don't think he realizes that bees can sting you because
					he thinks they're so cute and stuff and he's always like oh don't hurt the bees they they just want
					to make honey and collect pollen and stuff he's so peaceful but I think it would be interesting and
					nice to have our own fresh honey to go with our fresh eggs from our chickens yeah so yeah and also
					you know to get him into this habit of respecting his hobbies and trying new things and tune into
					his creativity right oh yeah he's actually a really awesome artist he's so good at drawing he draws
					uh trains and vehicles and things that I could never draw so he's he's got his own things going on
					and yeah I I spend a lot of my time just trying to keep up with him as well yeah so his hobbies are
					insects learning about insects and drawing drawing and uh he's got his own YouTube channel as well
					so I'm gonna have to go follow him every one we're gonna go follow Connor well I'll put a link to
					that as well he does little experiments and uh we go try and find trains and stuff he's he's his own
					little star so yeah he's got his own things going on too he's a funny kid he's a cool kid for sure
					and a smarty very smart yes yeah yeah I remembered that hobby that I forgot out of nowhere it's also
					related to sports so I would love to try surfing have you ever tried surfing I have not I have not
					because I fear sharks come on terrified that a shark will get me if I go surfing a shark is going to
					get me it's in my mind I know it will happen just my foot if I go surfing a shark will get my foot
					when I'm dipping my little toes in the water so yeah I feel you I feel you but you know I saw some
					really cool scenes like down in San Diego in California tons of people surf there you know
					California is like surf land everyone surfs there and I'm pretty sure there are sharks in the
					Pacific Ocean but there are also a lot of dolphins so I remember one day I was walking on the beach
					and I see this group of surfers just chilling they're just chilling on their surfboard like I mean
					they're just seated watching the sunset and this group of like five Dolphins just started circling
					around them and I just saw that and I was like wow that is amazing I would love to try that well
					maybe one day you'll be able to um yeah so where you're at right now is far away from anywhere you
					could surf maybe about an hour and a half about an hour and a half but I tried surfing once right
					and I actually had an instructor that day and it was like an hour and a half lesson and it is hard
					really so it's not like something that you learn in a weekend it's not like something you can do in
					a week like you really need a long time so I think surfing is for people who live near the beach and
					who have access to the beach otherwise it's not worth it for you to buy all the gear and to buy you
					know by the time of an instructor if you can only go you know once every two months or something you
					know yeah it's kind of a lifestyle it seems as well right but I'd love to live near the beach one
					day so maybe I'll do it later on for sure if you want to yeah I think uh I think everybody should
					have things that they would like to try in the future and then if you ever end up in a situation
					where you can it's like oh perfect right yeah or if you ever kind of hit rock bottom what I mean is
					have like a really rough moment in life hey this hobby can really bring up my spirits let me try
					something new and find inspiration in life again maybe one day I'll face my fear of sharks and go
					try surfing when I hit rock bottom yeah you need to but but yeah what do you think do you have any
					other hobbies that you'd like to try let's see hmm come on one of the most big Hobbies is do you
					like reading I I yeah I say I read every day a lot of times I I read in French uh because I like to
					kind of split up what I do with my languages so for example like for a month I'll be reading a lot
					in French and I'll be watching my shows in Spanish so that I I'm just able to get like both
					languages in on a regular basis so I read a lot in French with uh the app link which I love super
					good app and uh that's definitely an enjoyable hobby like when I go to pick up my son from school
					you have to wait in line for like 30 minutes so I'm reading uh right now I'm reading one of my
					favorite books ever The Count of Monte Cristo which was originally written in French now I'm reading
					it in French so that's super satisfying to me what about you do you like to read yeah no I love
					reading and I read every night as well right now I'm reading in English so I need to get back into
					reading in Portuguese but yeah right now I'm reading The Power of Now which is kind of like a if
					anyone knows it's like a self-help type of book where you kind of just supposedly learn how to live
					the present moment and enjoy life so that's kind of what I'm reading now we'll see how it goes I'm
					on page 10 so you know but yes I do love to read it's very satisfying recently I read a Spanish book
					La Casa de los espiritus for all of you who know the House of Spirits by Isabella who's like a very
					well we can say she's a revolutionary in Latin American literature from the from the 20th century
					and she's Chilean so she wrote about the revolution in Chile and the dictatorship so that's a really
					good book if you like history I personally love history and I love learning about history I love
					watching documentaries about history so that's a really good one for any of you who want to learn
					more about history dictatorships yeah definitely a lot to be learned from the past I think yeah for
					sure for sure reading is an excellent hobby excellent Pastime because you're investing in your own
					mind um I actually love self-help stuff as well yeah I I just finished a book called The Power of
					your subconscious mind wow that one is super cool and I it was super eye-opening about a lot of
					things uh kind of like the way you talk to yourself inside your mind is kind of what dictates
					everything else that goes on around you and if you're always thinking about bad things you're only
					going to see the bad on the outside so yeah absolutely yeah speak positively to yourself and another
					important thing is speak positively about others because if you criticize someone else you're
					bringing that negativity onto you right yeah absolutely human mind works and human behavior so I
					listen to tons of podcasts so that's another thing I listen to a podcast episode every day maybe two
					while I'm like eating or something eating lunch eating breakfast and cooking because I just love to
					listen to other people's voices and their opinions about the world and usually they're about
					psychology or about business so yeah I just want to educate myself you know as you said kind of feed
					the Mind nourish the mind for sure what's what podcasts have you been into lately or one that you
					just really love one that I really love this is a classic and you might like it actually when an
					English one in Spanish there's one called this is how I how I made this by Guy Raz how I made this
					it's about this guy who's basically interviewing successful business owners of many different
					businesses and asking them their story their story about how they made their business so you know
					I'm in the process of opening a business now so I'm trying to educate myself and learn mistakes and
					learn from others mistakes I should say so yes I am consuming a lot of content about business
					strategies and that kind of thing so how I made this and also there's one that's called in Spanish
					so this is by an Argentinian psychologist counselor I love that accent it's beautiful and she's just
					very well spoken and it's nice to listen to these Concepts concepts of psychology in Spanish because
					I just learned a ton of vocabulary and a ton of ways to talk about people in Spanish so that's a
					good one too how do you what is the title I'll send it to you after I'll send you a link okay but I
					definitely recommend it to anyone out there that wants to wants to learn Spanish or if you speak
					Spanish really good podcast okay super cool check that out also um go ahead I just want to say that
					you you said you're starting your business your site is awesome I looked at it so professional I was
					so proud and happy for you I was like oh wow it's my homie all right thank you oh Emma so uh I'll
					put a link in the description but that was so professional super well done awesome congratulations
					thank you I really appreciate that it's been a month in the works I've been working on it for a
					month every day just you know even on weekends because I'm new at this so it's going to take a lot
					more work here so yeah but thank you I really appreciate that yeah if anyone wants to take a look I
					have free resources I have free resources on there for language Learners so I have some study guides
					I have videos I have lessons and you can actually book an English lesson or a Spanish lesson with me
					if you're interested so that's there awesome awesome so what were you gonna say you have another
					Hobby because I see I've seen cooking yeah you like cooking right me too yeah I'm a big fan of
					cooking I love I also think that this is an art form honestly you have to be super creative with the
					ingredients so I do love cooking and I love to eat healthy so I try to do healthy versions of like
					junk food you know so I can eat delicious but healthy okay super cool um so what's something that is
					terrible junk food that you have made healthy okay come on terrible not terrible but I try to make
					it for example with whole wheat so I might do like lasagna with some sauce that doesn't have like a
					lot of sugar because you know tomato sauce has a lot of added sugar a lot of additives so I'll look
					for some options and have some vegetables so maybe with some green pepper and some chicken or tofu I
					might even use tofu and then I'll try to use the pasta the lasagna whole wheat and then maybe like
					some cheese with without lactose you know for those who have lactose intolerance yeah so I try to
					you know I mean lasagna is not necessarily unhealthy if you make it that way so that's one thing
					that I love to make what about you what's your favorite plate okay so many things so many things uh
					steak I I eat steak like twice a week you've seen my Facebook steak steak steak steak all the time I
					never get tired of it but something that I've tried making healthy a healthy version uh my son and I
					bought an ice cream making machine and uh yeah we we made it we bought uh milk from a local Farm
					cream and eggs from the local farm with honey from the farm so everything we used was local like
					real high quality ingredients uh raw honey instead of sugar and it came out so good A little bit of
					vanilla extract and it was amazing yeah I love that all the local ingredients I might also do
					something like that with like brownies for example you know use some local ingredients to make
					brownies not use as much sugar or instead of a lot of sugar use honey or coconut sugar you know just
					little tricks to make it a little bit healthier even though it is a dessert you know but a little
					bit here and a little bit there adds up and you're you're really doing something good for yourself I
					think definitely absolutely so what do you think are we good good on Hobbies I think we we both have
					a lot of hobbies yeah I think we could talk about this all day uh I I enjoy talking about my hobbies
					and it was interesting to hear what you enjoyed to do with your free time as well yeah for sure it
					seems like we have a lot of hobbies in common and to all of you all the hobbies are we want to hear
					from you as well for sure yeah for sure well it was a nice conversation uh-huh I I enjoyed uh
					speaking with you about our Hobbies collaborating on a video uh and let's do it again real soon yeah
					we definitely will so everyone you know what to do if you like this video please leave a like below
					comment to our Channel and also to Kyle's Channel English and yeah let's keep improving our language
