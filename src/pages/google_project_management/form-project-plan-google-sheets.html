					far,
					you should have completed a project charter for Sauce &amp; Spoon’s tablet rollout.<br />The project
					charter helps you organize vital project information, create a framework for the work that needs to
					be
					done, and communicate those details to the necessary people.<br />Once the project charter is
					created
					and confirmed, you’ll use it to start the project planning stage.<br />In the upcoming activities,
					we’ll
					be progressing from the initiation phase of the project lifecycle to the planning phase.<br />Here,
					you’ll put your knowledge and skills to work on a project plan, which is the central artifact a
					project
					manager builds during the planning phase.<br />Most projects capture requirements in this artifact,
					so
					the project plan you build for Sauce &amp; Spoon will be a critical part of your project management
					portfolio.<br />It will demonstrate your ability to break a large project into a set of achievable,
					smaller tasks.<br />Before we get started, let’s review the project scenario.<br />Sauce &amp; Spoon
					is
					a small but growing chain of restaurants with five locations.<br />They’ve hired Pita as their first
					in-house project manager to launch the pilot of tabletop tablet menus at two of their
					locations.<br />Throughout the course, you’ll observe Pita as she works to complete this project in
					scope, on time, and within budget.<br />You’ll create project management documents based on this
					scenario just as you would if you were the project manager.<br />As you work through these
					materials,
					you may want to take notes about project details in order to complete some of the
					activities.<br />The
					project management documents you create will help you practice your skills by applying them to a
					real-world scenario.<br />These documents will also provide you with a portfolio to speak to during
					a
					future job interview.<br />In the next group of activities, you’ll analyze conversations, emails,
					and
					other forms of documentation to build out the project plan.<br />As you continue on, you’ll identify
					tasks and milestones within the Sauce &amp; Spoon tablet rollout.<br />You’ll also demonstrate
					effective
					communication techniques, like asking the right questions and practicing empathy, which will help
					you
					make accurate time estimates for each task.<br />[MUSIC PLAYING] In this video, you’ll learn to
					analyze
					project documentation, including documents from previous projects, to identify tasks for a new
					project.<br />This documentation includes project charters, emails, and old project plans, which a
					business may have available when you join a new organization or switch to a new project.<br />Then
					in
					the upcoming activity, you’ll begin building the project plan for Sauce &amp; Spoon’s tablet rollout
					by
					adding project tasks to a spreadsheet that will serve as your project plan.<br />I recommend that
					you
					use the provided project plan template to start your document, but you’re also welcome to create
					your
					own spreadsheet or use your preferred project management software.<br />Let’s get
					started.<br />First,
					we’ll review the purpose and function of a project plan.<br />A project plan is useful for any
					project,
					big or small, since it helps you document the scope, tasks, milestones, budget, and overall
					activities
					in order to keep the project on track.<br />At the center of the project plan is the project
					schedule.<br />The schedule is your guide for making time estimates for project tasks, determining
					milestones, and monitoring the overall progress of the project.<br />One of your main jobs as a
					project
					manager is to identify all of the project tasks, estimate how much time each task will take, and
					track
					each task’s progress.<br />So how do you go about adding tasks and milestones to the plan for the
					very
					first time?<br />The first thing I do is review the goals and deliverables in the project
					charter.<br />Then I make a list of all the items that have tasks or milestones associated with
					them.<br />As a reminder, milestones are important points within the schedule that indicate
					progress.<br />They usually signify the completion of a deliverable or phase of the
					project.<br />And
					project tasks refer to activities that need to be accomplished within a set period of
					time.<br />They’re
					assigned to different members of the team according to each person’s role and skills.<br />In order
					to
					reach a milestone, you and your team must complete certain tasks.<br />For example, one of the
					deliverables of the Sauce &amp; Spoon project is promoting the new tablet menus with table signs and
					email blasts.<br />In this instance, a milestone could be the completion of this deliverable, which
					would include all of the tasks that are required for getting sign-offs on the final versions of the
					marketing materials and confirming the dates of the email blasts.<br />Some of these tasks would
					include
					writing multiple drafts of the different marketing materials, generating an email list, and
					programming
					the emails to be sent on the correct dates.<br />For each deliverable, ask yourself, what steps do
					we
					need to take in order to achieve this?<br />The steps will become the individual tasks that need to
					be
					completed.<br />Let’s turn our attention to another deliverable for Sauce &amp; Spoon, the
					implementation of a post-dining survey to assess customer satisfaction.<br />What steps do you need
					to
					take in order to achieve this deliverable?<br />You might need to assign a team member to develop a
					survey.<br />You’ll also need to determine how you’ll deliver the survey and create a process for
					carrying it out.<br />These are just a couple of examples of the many tasks you’ll need to complete
					in
					order to achieve the deliverable.<br />It’s your job to help uncover the rest of the tasks.<br />How
					do
					you uncover more tasks?<br />In addition to the project charter, there are other common forms of
					documentation that can help you identify tasks.<br />For example, you might ask your stakeholders or
					colleagues to share emails or an older project plan for a similar project.<br />Let’s discuss how
					these
					might be useful as you build your list of tasks.<br />Emails that relate to the project can provide
					lots
					of helpful information for you to pull tasks from.<br />Since so much communication in the workplace
					happens over email, ask to have relevant emails that contain discussions about the project’s details
					forwarded to you.<br />These emails can help you uncover tasks, and they can also help you identify
					team
					members to connect with further if you have additional questions.<br />It’s also helpful to review
					an
					older project plan for a similar initiative to find out what kind of tasks were included.<br />For
					example, if you were a project manager tasked with launching a new product, you might ask a
					colleague
					with experience launching other products for the same company to share their project plan as an
					example.<br />Or if your project includes some construction work, you might ask colleagues about
					unrelated projects that also had construction components.<br />Previous project plans can provide
					helpful inspiration as you create your own list of tasks.<br />They can also help you identify
					possible
					task durations, subject-matter experts, and even suppliers that may be helpful to your
					project.<br />As
					you review project documentation, take note of information that suggests other tasks your team will
					need
					to complete in order to execute on project deliverables.<br />During this process, ask yourself
					questions like, is there a large task being worked on by many people that could be broken into
					smaller
					tasks assigned to individuals?<br />Are there signals that imply prior tasks need to be completed
					first?<br />For example, a deliverable like “install tablets” might imply selecting a tablet vendor
					as a
					prior task.<br />Great.<br />We’ve covered a lot in this video, so let’s review.<br />The project
					plan
					helps document the scope, tasks, milestones, budget, and overall activities in order to keep the
					project
					on track.<br />To add tasks to your plan, search for useful information from existing project
					documentation, such as the project charter, email threads, and old project plans from a similar
					project.<br />As you review project documentation, take note of information that suggests additional
					tasks and milestones that your team will need to complete in order to meet project
					deliverables.<br />Great.<br />In the next activity, you’ll review the supporting materials to start
					building the Sauce &amp; Spoon project plan.<br />[MUSIC PLAYING] By now, you should have analyzed
					existing project documentation to identify a list of tasks related to the Sauce &amp; Spoon tablet
					pilot.<br />In this video, I’ll share a few tips for conducting online research, which is a helpful
					strategy for gathering domain knowledge.<br />Domain knowledge refers to knowledge of a specific
					industry, topic, or activity.<br />If you’re unfamiliar with a new project’s domain, then analyzing
					supporting project documentation will help you broaden your knowledge.<br />There will be times
					throughout your career when you’ll be new to an organization or industry.<br />You might be assigned
					to
					a project that’s unlike anything you’ve ever managed before, and that’s OK.<br />New challenges can
					be a
					really exciting part of the job.<br />So how do you identify tasks and monitor progress for a
					project or
					industry that you’re not familiar with?<br />Another key to success when working on an unfamiliar
					project is knowing where to find useful information that can help you increase your domain
					knowledge.<br />Here’s an example.<br />Let’s say you’ve been hired to manage projects in the
					private
					banking industry.<br />In order to successfully manage these projects, you’ll need a basic
					understanding
					of how private banking works.<br />This includes things like how clients open accounts, back office
					operations, and how trade confirmations are verified.<br />And in the case of Sauce &amp; Spoon,
					you’ll
					need a base-level understanding of the restaurant industry, some of which you’ve already come across
					during this course, like knowing about guest averages and table turn times.<br />Again, you don’t
					need
					to be an expert on your project, but becoming more familiar with different industries and types of
					projects is a valuable skill that demonstrates your versatility.<br />Having industry knowledge can
					also
					save you time on future projects within that industry since you won’t have to ask as many questions
					or
					do as much research.<br />That said, if you’re new to an industry or organization, no one will
					expect
					you to have all the answers right away.<br />One way to help build up your domain knowledge when you
					get
					started with project planning is through online research.<br />Online research can help increase
					your
					knowledge of industry terms, techniques, processes, and more, all of which can be helpful as you
					embark
					on a new project.<br />This allows you to read up on how other organizations have managed similar
					projects.<br />It’s also an opportunity to draw inspiration from their successes and to learn from
					their
					mistakes.<br />So what should you be aiming for as you do research for a given project?<br />Let’s
					go
					over a few tips that can help you get started.<br />First, try searching online for news coverage of
					similar projects at other companies.<br />For example, you might search for news articles that focus
					on
					restaurant groups who’ve added tablet-ordering capabilities to their restaurant
					locations.<br />Experiment with search terms like “menu tablet news” or “restaurant tablet news” to
					find
					relevant news articles.<br />As you read, take notes on interesting findings.<br />Did the company
					experience any surprising outcomes following their product’s launch?<br />Did they come across any
					unanticipated roadblocks?<br />If so, make note of these and decide if there are tasks that you
					should
					add to your project in order to achieve similar results or to avoid similar
					roadblocks.<br />Identifying
					where similar successes or mistakes might play out in your own project can help you uncover tasks
					that
					you may have otherwise overlooked.<br />It’s also helpful to search online for research on topics
					related to your project.<br />For example, you might search for phrases like “restaurant tablet
					research” or “digital menu ordering.” Adding search tags like “best practices” or “key takeaways”
					can
					help streamline your search results.<br />Then you can review the relevant research for information
					that
					might help inform your project planning.<br />You can also try researching similar projects in other
					industries.<br />This can be especially helpful when you’re new to a project or industry.<br />For
					example, even though your project may center around tablet usage in a restaurant setting, you can
					also
					learn about the installation process from research on tablet usage in similar settings, like retail
					stores or coffee shops.<br />The details will be different, but similar projects in other industries
					can
					be a helpful source of ideas.<br />Once you’ve done some initial online research, review the list of
					tasks that you’ve identified so far and research the specifics of executing that work.<br />For
					example,
					maybe one of the tasks on your list is choosing the tablet model that you’ll ultimately install in
					the
					restaurants.<br />Are there any smaller subtasks your team will need to complete to decide on a
					tablet
					model?<br />Searching online can help to uncover any additional tasks you’ll need to account
					for.<br />Well done.<br />Let’s recap what we learned in this video.<br />Online research can help
					you
					increase your domain knowledge of industry terms, techniques, processes, and more.<br />When you
					conduct
					your online research, keep the following tips in mind.<br />Search for news articles about similar
					projects at other companies, research similar projects in other industries, and finally, review your
					list of tasks and research the specifics of executing that work.<br />[MUSIC PLAYING] In this video,
					you’ll learn how to identify more tasks by analyzing key conversations related to the
					project.<br />The
					Sauce &amp; Spoon project is fairly complex and will result in a project plan with many
					tasks.<br />Populating your plan with a set of tasks can indicate to future employers that you’re
					able
					to identify key areas of work based on documentation, research, conversations, and more.<br />It can
					also demonstrate that you’re able to synthesize these tasks into a single organized document, which
					is a
					critical part of project management.<br />Reviewing project documentation and researching your
					project
					online can help you identify tasks, but that won’t tell you everything you need to
					know.<br />Discussions with other people working on the project, from stakeholders to team members,
					can
					help you uncover tasks that you’re still missing or clarify the smaller subtasks.<br />Let’s start
					with
					tips for identifying tasks through group conversations with members of your project team.<br />One
					way
					to discover more tasks is to hold a group brainstorm session with team members who will likely work
					on
					those tasks.<br />For example, Pita might meet with the Sauce &amp; Spoon project team to brainstorm
					potential challenges that the waitstaff and guests might have with the tablets.<br />Discussing
					these as
					a group can help identify ideas for tasks that may have been overlooked.<br />Another way to
					discover
					tasks is to hold one-on-one conversations with team members about tasks they’ll likely be
					responsible
					for completing.<br />For example, you might have a discussion with a vendor who specializes in
					training
					restaurant employees to determine how to prepare for the training.<br />Or you might reach out to a
					graphic designer to discuss creating new marketing materials.<br />Your team, outside vendors, and
					company executives have specific expertise and job experience that gives them a deeper understanding
					of
					the work required to complete tasks or reach milestones.<br />Through conversations with teammates,
					you
					might learn that certain tasks are more complex than you assumed, or that you’re missing a key step
					of a
					given process.<br />In this case, leverage the expertise of your teammates to discover what you
					don’t
					know and to fill in gaps in your list of tasks.<br />In addition to connecting with teammates to
					uncover
					project tasks, it may also be helpful to consult with other people in your organization who are
					experts
					on given tasks.<br />Though these people may not be involved in your project, they may be able to
					provide valuable expertise that can help you identify processes and fill in gaps.<br />Once you’ve
					connected with members of your project team and other experts in your organization, examine your
					list of
					tasks.<br />Are there still areas where you need more information?<br />If so, it may be helpful to
					have
					a conversation with your key stakeholders to fill in any gaps.<br />As we’ve discussed, senior
					stakeholders are often busy with other aspects of their jobs, so you should be strategic about who
					to
					ask for a conversation.<br />Stakeholders who have high- or medium-level interest or influence in
					the
					project are most likely to provide the information you need.<br />Some examples include stakeholders
					who
					are subject-matter experts and those who are directly affected by the outcome of the project, like
					your
					team’s leadership.<br />You can refer back to your stakeholder analysis for help deciding who would
					be
					best to connect with.<br />Once you’ve identified which stakeholders would be most helpful, make
					sure
					you’re prepared by gathering as much information as possible ahead of your conversation and
					outlining
					clear outstanding questions that you still need answers to.<br />During the conversation, present
					your
					research and your current list of tasks and explain exactly how they can help you move
					forward.<br />This will give your stakeholder a clear picture of what you’ve accomplished so far and
					help them to identify gaps or missing tasks that are required to achieve your goal.<br />Ample
					preparation helps ensure that you can get the information you need while respecting the limited time
					of
					your stakeholders.<br />Keep in mind that conversations you have about project tasks will often
					contain
					more details and information than you need to create a thorough list, but you may want to note some
					of
					this extra information since it may be useful later in the project.<br />Each task on your list
					should
					be detailed enough that you’ll be able to check in on progress and identify problems early on, but
					not
					so detailed that you’re endlessly revising your project plan and burdening your team with the need
					to
					update you constantly on their work.<br />The right level of detail to include in your task list
					will
					vary from project to project and team to team, and striking the right balance is a skill you’ll
					develop
					over the course of your career.<br />OK, let’s do a quick recap.<br />Discussions with other people
					working on the project can help you uncover missing tasks or clarify smaller subtasks.<br />Some
					ways to
					uncover tasks include brainstorming with team members assigned to similar or related tasks, holding
					one-on-one conversations with team members about tasks, consulting with other people in your
					organization who are experts on given tasks, and having conversations with stakeholders.<br />The
					right
					level of detail to include in your task list will vary from project to project and team to
					team.<br />As
					a project manager, a key part of your role is identifying the right level of detail and then
					synthesizing it into a clear, concise list of tasks in the project plan.<br />In the upcoming
					activity,
					you’ll review the supporting materials to uncover more task details and add them to the Sauce &amp;
					Spoon project plan.<br />[MUSIC PLAYING] So far, you’ve identified and added tasks to your project
					plan.<br />You’ve gathered information from relevant project documentation, online research, and
					other
					people on the project team.<br />In this video, I’ll discuss how to order your task list and share
					several techniques for identifying milestones.<br />Maybe you’ve already identified a few milestones
					on
					your own.<br />These techniques will be helpful to keep in mind when you’re working through the
					activity
					after this video.<br />Let’s start with ordering your task list.<br />By now, you should have a long
					list of project tasks.<br />To finalize the list, review what you have so far.<br />Check for any
					remaining larger tasks that could still be broken down into smaller subtasks, and add those tasks to
					your list.<br />When you think you’ve listed all the necessary project tasks in your project plan,
					the
					next step is to arrange the tasks in the order that they need to be completed.<br />Determining the
					proper task order will help you assign start and end dates for each task.<br />When determining
					priority, first consider the basic order of operations.<br />In other words, what is the natural
					sequence of tasks?<br />Are there any dependencies or prerequisites?<br />For example, you can’t
					train
					staff on how to use the tablets before they’ve been installed and tested.<br />To help you order
					tasks,
					you can have a conversation with your team to uncover dependencies or prerequisites from each person
					who
					owns a task.<br />You might ask each person what needs to happen before they can start their
					work.<br />Similarly, you can search the internet for information with terms such as “prerequisites
					for
					launching new hardware.” After you’ve thought through the order, adjust the tasks in your project
					plan
					to reflect this order.<br />To do this, simply rearrange the spreadsheet rows to set the order for
					your
					tasks.<br />For example, the task of researching different models of menu tablets needs to happen
					before
					the task of signing a contract with a menu tablet supplier.<br />Makes sense, right?<br />You
					probably
					wouldn’t want to sign a contract with a supplier before you’d researched every possible
					option.<br />Once your tasks are in order, you’ll begin identifying milestones.<br />Remember that
					milestones are important points within the project schedule that indicate progress.<br />Milestones
					usually signify the completion of a deliverable or phase of the project.<br />To determine
					milestones
					within your list of tasks, identify points in the project plan where you and your team can evaluate
					the
					work completed so far.<br />For example, if there are multiple tasks related to menu tablet
					installation, a milestone might be the first internal test run of the tablet’s ordering
					capabilities.<br />These types of milestones may be the same as some of the deliverables you listed
					earlier.<br />Another way to determine milestones is to identify important tasks that your
					stakeholders
					have a particular interest in.<br />To do this, review your notes from previous conversations with
					stakeholders and identify tasks that stakeholders seemed eager to know more about or wanted to
					review
					when complete.<br />If your stakeholder has a high interest in a given task or point in the project,
					label that task as a milestone.<br />For example, one of the Sauce &amp; Spoon stakeholders might be
					interested in knowing when a tablet supplier has been selected, since that decision will impact the
					budget.<br />As you review your list, you should also identify tasks that carry a high risk or
					signal
					the completion of a phase or major task.<br />These tasks are often considered milestones because
					they
					have a major impact on the project’s overall progress.<br />For example, the first successful test
					run
					of the menu tablet’s ordering capabilities might be considered a milestone.<br />Amazing
					job.<br />Let’s
					review.<br />Once you’ve listed all of the necessary tasks in your project plan, you’ll need to
					rearrange the tasks in the order in which your team needs to complete them.<br />It’s also important
					to
					consider the natural sequence of tasks, as well as the dependencies or prerequisites for each
					task.<br />Once your tasks are in order, you’ll need to identify milestones.<br />When determining
					milestones, it’s crucial to identify the points in the project plan where you can evaluate the work
					completed so far, identify the tasks that stakeholders have a particular interest in, and identify
					tasks
					that carry a high risk or signal the completion of a phase or major task.<br />OK, ready to get back
					into your project plan?<br />Head to the next activity to reorder your list of project tasks and
					identify your project milestones.<br />[MUSIC PLAYING] Time estimation is a prediction of the total
					amount of time required to complete a task.<br />Providing time estimates for each task gives you a
					better sense of the overall project timeline in relation to individual deadlines and
					milestones.<br />Knowing the estimated duration of a task also lets you easily track its progress,
					so
					you can recognize if the task is likely to go over the estimated time.<br />That way, you’ll be
					better
					able to project the timeline and quickly make any necessary adjustments.<br />As I mentioned
					earlier,
					you won’t necessarily be an expert on the projects you manage initially.<br />On top of reviewing
					project documentation and doing some research, you’ll also need the help of your team and other
					subject-matter experts to fill in some of the details and provide input.<br />Asking the right
					questions
					can help your experts get to the most accurate time estimates possible.<br />Let’s go over some
					strategies for getting accurate time estimates from your task experts.<br />First, check their
					understanding of the task.<br />Ask the expert to explain all the detailed steps involved in the
					task.<br />You won’t include every detail in the project plan, but by having the expert do this,
					you’re
					getting them to thoroughly think through the work involved before providing you with an
					estimate.<br />Next, ask for estimates of the substeps and make note of them.<br />Then add them all
					up
					and compare that total with the expert’s estimate of the total time needed to complete the
					task.<br />Another strategy is to discuss the assumptions the expert might be making when they give
					you
					an estimate.<br />For example, what equipment do they assume they’ll have, what kind of
					supplies?<br />How many people do they assume are working on the task?<br />What are their
					assumptions
					about the skill and experience level of the people working alongside them on the task?<br />Then ask
					the
					task expert to consider how likely it might be that all or some of these assumptions might not work
					out
					and how that might impact their estimate.<br />One important detail to clarify here is the
					difference
					between an effort estimate and a total duration estimate.<br />An effort estimate only takes into
					account the actual time it takes to complete a task.<br />A total duration estimate accounts for the
					effort estimation and any other factors, like getting approvals, prep work, testing, and so
					on.<br />For
					example, imagine one of your tasks is designing and launching the checkout page for the
					tablet.<br />The
					effort estimation for designing the page might be eight hours, which is the amount of time it takes
					to
					mock up and implement the design, but the total duration of the task includes testing, feedback, and
					approvals needed to launch.<br />That means that the total time estimate for the checkout page is
					actually more than eight hours.<br />Finally, another strategy for getting accurate estimates is to
					compare the expert’s estimates against the actual time spent on similar tasks in previous
					work.<br />Ask
					the expert to think about a similar project they worked on and describe what was different and what
					was
					the same.<br />Ask how long that project took and whether thinking about that project changes their
					estimate at all.<br />OK, let’s review what we just covered.<br />Time estimation is a prediction of
					the
					total amount of time required to complete a task.<br />Providing estimates for each task gives you a
					big-picture sense of the project timeline in relation to individual deadlines and milestones, and
					asking
					the right questions can help your experts get to the most accurate estimate possible.<br />Try
					checking
					their understanding of the task or ask for estimates of the substeps, discuss assumptions, and
					compare
					the experts estimates against the actual time spent on similar tasks in previous work.<br />[MUSIC
					PLAYING] I’ve got one more technique for figuring out accurate time estimates.<br />It’s called
					three-point estimating.<br />Three-point estimating is used to help determine the most realistic
					time
					estimate for a task.<br />It uses optimistic and pessimistic calculations, meaning calculations
					based on
					the best-case and the worst-case scenarios.<br />A side benefit to this strategy is that it takes
					into
					account potential risks that could impact not only the task estimation but other aspects of the
					project,
					like budget and resources.<br />Just as the name implies, in three-point estimating, there are three
					parts of the estimate to examine.<br />Here’s how it works.<br />Each task receives three times
					estimates– optimistic, most likely, and pessimistic.<br />Each estimate indicates the projected
					amount
					of time a task will take under that category and how likely any potential risks are to
					occur.<br />An
					optimistic estimate assumes the best-case scenario.<br />Issues will not occur, and the task will be
					completed within the estimated time.<br />In other words, it’s how long you hope the task will take,
					assuming everything goes as planned, for example, if all the supplies needed for a task come in
					early
					and everything works the way it’s supposed to.<br />A most likely estimate assumes some issues might
					occur.<br />Another way to think about a most-likely estimate is that it is based on how long the
					task
					usually takes under normal circumstances, like if arrive at the expected time and you only need to
					make
					some slight adjustments before everything eventually works the way it’s supposed to.<br />And
					finally, a
					pessimistic estimate assumes that issues will definitely occur.<br />This is where everything that
					could
					go wrong does go wrong, for example, if the supplies are late or the order is incorrect and nothing
					works the way it’s supposed to.<br />When determining estimates using this technique, you’ll need to
					ask
					your task experts questions or conduct research that will help you understand best- and worst-case
					scenarios.<br />Then add these notes to the plan for each task.<br />Let’s try out three-point
					estimating with an example from the Sauce &amp; Spoon project, the task of training the staff to use
					the
					tablets.<br />You ask the person tasked with arranging the staff training to give you a time
					estimate in
					each category and to describe the conditions for each.<br />The task expert tells you that the
					conditions for an optimistic estimate would mean the vendor who is hired to do training is well
					qualified, has all the materials they need, and shows up on time to deliver the training.<br />All
					of
					the staff shows up on time and successfully completes the training within the scheduled amount of
					time.<br />All of the equipment works for the staff to practice on.<br />In this best-case scenario,
					your task expert estimates four hours, two hours to conduct the training, and one hour each for
					setup
					and post-training review on the originally scheduled date.<br />In a most likely scenario, the task
					expert assumes that the vendor is qualified but might not have all the necessary materials, so
					they’ll
					need to modify something or someone on the restaurant staff will need to find some supplies.<br />Or
					the
					vendor might be new and need extra time to prepare or take longer to deliver the
					training.<br />Usually,
					a couple of staff members can’t attend or be on time, so extra training time would need to be
					scheduled.<br />There could also be some minor glitches with the equipment, and the training might
					need
					to be rescheduled for a different day later in the week.<br />The time estimate in this case is
					closer
					to six hours, and the date is likely to get changed to two or three days later than originally
					planned.<br />Under pessimistic conditions, you could have a situation where the original training
					vendor quits, and a new vendor has to be hired.<br />There could be several unexpected staff
					no-shows or
					turnover right before the training.<br />Or possibly, the equipment doesn’t get delivered on time or
					doesn’t work, so the training can’t happen until the new equipment arrives.<br />In this case, the
					actual training time is still around six hours, but the date has to be rescheduled for up to a full
					week
					later than originally planned.<br />When conducting your own research or having conversations with
					task
					experts, be mindful of the three points so that you can determine the outcomes of optimistic, most
					likely, and pessimistic timing.<br />If someone quotes you a time estimate, don’t just take their
					word
					for it without understanding the context they’re estimating from.<br />Think about it this
					way.<br />If
					someone is being optimistic, they might estimate that a task will only take them two days to
					complete.<br />If you go with that estimate and it ends up taking a whole week, your schedule is
					off.<br />But if someone is being pessimistic and quotes one month and the task only takes a week,
					then
					you’ve got extra time in your schedule that could have gone toward other tasks or led to an earlier
					product release.<br />Always accounting for a worst-case scenario might seem like a good thing, but
					it’s
					actually wasteful if you calculate most of your estimates this way.<br />So you want to examine the
					best- and worst-case scenario timing and compare these with the most likely scenario.<br />From
					there,
					you can build in a buffer that accounts for risks that are likely but still keeps the project
					progressing at an efficient rate.<br />[MUSIC PLAYING] Being able to share these ratings with
					stakeholders is helpful because they indicate how likely it is that a task will be completed in the
					amount of time estimated.<br />Estimating is not a perfect science, so adding a confidence-level
					rating
					for a task allows you to address any uncertainty.<br />In an upcoming activity, you’ll finish
					calculating your time estimates and add confidence-level ratings to your tasks in the Sauce &amp;
					Spoon
					project plan.<br />Let’s get started.<br />A confidence-level rating ranges from high, meaning
					you’re
					very confident in your estimate, to low, meaning you’re not very confident in your
					estimate.<br />Knowing the confidence level of your estimate and adding notes about any risks or
					issues
					that might affect the estimate can help you identify whether you should ask the project team for
					their
					input.<br />They might be able to point out the estimates or tasks you should track more
					closely.<br />Additionally, if you notice that your confidence is low across a large percentage of
					task
					estimates, you might want to communicate your uncertainty about the project timeline to
					stakeholders.<br />There are a few ways to determine a confidence-level rating.<br />Using the
					three-point technique we just discussed is one way of gaining confidence in your estimates.<br />If
					you
					can show that you’ve considered the best- and worst-case conditions for a task, then your
					confidence-level rating for that task’s time estimate would be high, since you have a thorough
					understanding of the task.<br />Another way to determine a confidence rating is by polling your team
					about the tasks they’re assigned and coming to a consensus about your collective confidence.<br />To
					do
					this, you could calculate their level of confidence as a percentage, which means polling everyone on
					their estimates and calculating the average confidence level.<br />You might find that they’re 90%
					confident, which would mean you have an overall high confidence rating, or maybe they’re only 60%
					confident, which would mean you have a medium confidence rating.<br />Or you could define categories
					for
					the team.<br />For example, we’ve never done a project like this before.<br />We’ve done this once
					before.<br />We’ve done this a handful of times, and we’ve done this a ton of times
					already.<br />Each
					category correlates to your confidence level.<br />If they’ve never done the project before or have
					only
					done it once, then the confidence rating for the time estimate might be low.<br />Estimating is far
					from
					an exact science, particularly in project management when there are so many
					unknowns.<br />Implementing
					a system that accounts for those unknowns and ensures an accurate picture of the project timeline
					means
					everyone will be better off over the long term.<br />OK, let’s review what we’ve covered.<br />A
					confidence-level rating indicates how confident you are in an estimate’s accuracy.<br />You can
					determine confidence ratings in a few ways, including polling your team on the tasks they’re
					assigned to
					or by defining categories.<br />And remember, estimating is far from an exact science, particularly
					in
					project management when there are so many unknowns.<br />Implementing a system that accounts for
					those
					unknowns and ensures an accurate picture of project costs means everyone will be better off over the
					long term.<br />[MUSIC PLAYING] Now that you’ve added tasks, time estimates, and confidence ratings
					to
					your project plan, let’s prepare for upcoming negotiations concerning time estimates.<br />Pita has
					to
					negotiate with team members about some of the tasks that have low confidence level ratings or that
					are
					estimated to take longer than she’d hoped.<br />You’ll help by analyzing the supporting materials,
					recording notes, and identifying some effective negotiation techniques.<br />Earlier, you applied
					some
					negotiation skills to discussions about the project scope.<br />Negotiation skills can also help you
					get
					accurate time and effort estimates, but the skills you use and the approach you take will be a
					little
					different.<br />In this case, you’re negotiating with a task expert, not a stakeholder.<br />Your
					goal
					is to try to determine an accurate time and effort estimate for a task, instead of persuading them
					to
					agree with a certain outcome.<br />You’re trying to arrive at an objectively accurate estimate
					together.<br />On any project, you’ll have to work with people who have a tendency to over- or
					underestimate time, costs, or resources.<br />People don’t do this intentionally.<br />Usually,
					they’re
					just being optimistic or trying to please you by providing what they think you want to hear rather
					than
					what’s realistic.<br />Or sometimes, they might be overly cautious and give you an extreme estimate
					in
					case something doesn’t go according to plan.<br />In some situations, using negotiation skills to
					get
					accurate time estimates might be critical to the success of the project.<br />There are lots of
					different negotiation techniques out there, but let’s focus on a few that are specific to
					negotiating a
					time estimate.<br />They are, say no without saying no; focus on interests, not positions; present
					mutually beneficial options; and insist on objective criteria.<br />If a task expert gives you a
					time
					estimate that’s different from what you hoped for, there are a few techniques you can use to try and
					reach an estimate that works for both of you.<br />Let’s start with the first technique, saying no
					without saying no.<br />The idea behind this technique is to get the other person to start working
					out
					an alternative solution with you.<br />Here’s how.<br />First, think about the ways we usually tell
					someone no.<br />That won’t work.<br />That’s not going to happen.<br />I can’t do that, or there’s
					no
					way.<br />Statements like these can make the person you’re communicating with feel defensive and
					shut
					down the conversation.<br />Instead, ask open-ended questions like, how would you like me to
					proceed?<br />How can we solve this problem, and what can I do to help?<br />Questions like these
					invite
					the other person to collaborate with you.<br />This keeps the conversation focused on reaching a
					resolution that works for both of you.<br />Let’s explore the next technique, focus on interests,
					not
					positions.<br />Here, the goal is not to win.<br />Instead, try to identify the other person’s
					interests, their basic needs, wants, and motivations around completing a certain task.<br />You
					might be
					working with a task expert who cares deeply about completing the task with a high degree of quality,
					but
					you’re concerned that if you don’t meet the deadline, the quality of the work won’t matter.<br />You
					can
					ask if there are any areas of quality they’d be willing to compromise on that would shorten the
					schedule
					estimate but still allow them to complete the task to an acceptable degree.<br />A third technique
					is to
					present mutually beneficial options.<br />We covered this a little already, but here’s how you can
					apply
					this concept when negotiating time estimates.<br />Imagine both you and your task expert want to
					complete the task as quickly as possible, but the expert’s time estimate is still longer than you’d
					like.<br />Asking some open-ended questions, like the ones listed earlier, can help you figure out
					if
					there’s a solution that will satisfy both of your goals.<br />Maybe there’s information the expert
					is
					missing or a resource that you could commit to finding and supplying to make the estimate
					lower.<br />The last technique is to insist on using objective criteria to define a time
					estimate.<br />Objective criteria is based on neutral information, like market value, research
					findings,
					previously documented experience, or laws and regulations.<br />When you use objective criteria,
					you’re
					basing the agreement on known or shared principles.<br />The key is to agree in advance about which
					objective criteria to consult and then to use the information to determine your estimates.<br />You
					might have an expert who insists on following their instincts when coming up with time
					estimates.<br />If you ask them in advance to provide clear, objective data that supports their
					instincts, you can get them to arrive at a more accurate estimate.<br />OK, let’s review what we’ve
					covered.<br />There are many scenarios where negotiation skills for a time estimate might be
					critical to
					the success of the project.<br />A few techniques that are specific to negotiating a time estimate
					are,
					say no without saying no; focus on interests, not positions; present mutually beneficial options;
					and
					insist on objective criteria.<br />[MUSIC PLAYING] Asking for time estimates or questioning why an
					aspect of the project is delayed can be a difficult conversation.<br />That’s why practicing empathy
					is
					so important when negotiating and when communicating in general.<br />Empathy is the ability to
					understand and feel what others are feeling.<br />It’s when you make the effort to imagine yourself
					in
					the other person’s position and experience things from their perspective.<br />Approaching a
					conversation with empathy can make the discussion much easier.<br />You’ve learned about how to
					bring
					empathy into project management in general, including being present, listening, and asking
					questions.<br />In this video, we’ll discuss how you can bring empathy to conversations about task
					estimates and timelines.<br />Asking questions about how long a task will take can make some people
					feel
					insecure.<br />They might feel like you don’t trust them, that you think they’re not competent, that
					you
					believe you know more than they do about their own work, and so on.<br />Have you ever felt like
					someone
					didn’t trust you or questioned your ability to complete your work?<br />Even when you’re just trying
					to
					get a clear understanding of a task you don’t understand, asking questions without empathy can leave
					team members with the sense that you’re micromanaging them.<br />Micromanaging is when a manager too
					closely observes, controls, or continuously reminds the people they’re managing of the work they’ve
					been
					assigned.<br />This has a negative impact because it demonstrates the manager’s lack of trust and
					confidence in the people they oversee.<br />There are several ways you can bring empathy to your
					conversations.<br />One way is to listen with curiosity.<br />Ask questions to demonstrate your
					interest
					in what people have to say.<br />Rather than making assumptions or suggestions, start the
					conversation
					with a question.<br />For example, you might ask the person how long a particular task took them on
					a
					previous project, rather than suggesting a time frame to complete a similar task.<br />Another way
					to
					show empathy is to periodically repeat what you think the other person said.<br />Noticing you
					restate
					their message in your own words will encourage them to confirm their intent and will ensure you
					understand what they’re communicating.<br />It might also help them view the issues you’re
					discussing
					from a different perspective.<br />You can also demonstrate empathy by trying to connect with their
					experience.<br />Let the person know that you understand that making estimations can be difficult
					for
					anyone, yourself included.<br />You might share a time on a project when you struggled with making a
					time estimate for a task or misestimated it altogether.<br />Make it clear that they want to do the
					best
					job possible, and you want to support them.<br />Practicing empathy also means you’re able to
					recognize
					your own judgments.<br />Acknowledge to yourself if you’re making internal judgments about the
					person
					you’re communicating with, like if you’re having doubts about their work quality, for
					example.<br />Then
					find ways to view the situation more compassionately.<br />Even if you don’t speak your judgments
					aloud,
					people are very good at reading body language and facial expressions and interpreting the tone of
					others.<br />Try to put yourself in the other person’s position and find out about any barriers they
					might be facing.<br />Another strategy for practicing empathy is recognizing buffering.<br />A team
					member might add a buffer to their time estimate for a task without communicating why they added the
					buffer.<br />Ask them upfront if they’ve included a buffer to account for holidays, sickness, child
					care, or emergencies.<br />This can demonstrate your empathy for their situation and can also help
					you
					get a more accurate estimate.<br />Encourage them to open up about this extra buffer by assuring
					them
					that you want an honest answer, even if it’s not ideal.<br />And finally, in order to effectively
					employ
					all of these strategies for practicing empathy in your conversations, you need to be able to fully
					focus
					on what the other person is communicating.<br />This means avoiding distractions.<br />Putting your
					phone on silent, not looking at phone notifications or texting, and closing your laptop are some
					ways to
					show the person that you’re giving them your undivided attention and that what they’re sharing is
					important to you.<br />Let’s do a quick review.<br />Empathy is the ability to understand and feel
					what
					others are feeling.<br />Some tips for bringing empathy to your conversations are listen with
					curiosity,
					repeat what you think you heard, connect with their experience, recognize judgments, recognize
					buffering, and avoid distractions.<br />ROWENA: Congratulations on finishing this video in the
