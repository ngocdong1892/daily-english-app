					welcome back Kyle he's here with us from pensando Eng he's a former Spanish student of mine how long
					were you studying Spanish with me Kyle so I believe we were doing classes for over a year yeah I
					think it was close to two years was it okay yeah yeah I'm pretty sure it was that was a few years
					ago but now you're fluent in Spanish what level would you say that you have in Spanish between B2
					and C1 I'd say I I could live my life in Spanish without problems but I haven't studied the grammar
					to the point where I don't make mistakes you know because I'm comfortable with where I'm at and I'm
					not trying to impress anybody on like a university or academic level right I'm not taking tests so I
					am more than happy to be able to watch shows watch movies in Spanish and meet new people and have
					wonderful conversations so my level is I can live my life in Spanish happily and that's a blessing
					it's a gift and I love it right I think that's one of the things we have to take into account when
					we're learning languages because a lot of times we have different goals right like for you and for
					me I just want to be able to live comfortably in Spanish and be able to live my life and talk to
					people and have fun and not be left out of the jokes but there's people who have to take tests and
					get certified in Cambridge and whatever to me I I'm not interested in that but well if that's your
					goal and you need it for your job in University that's totally understandable absolutely if you're
					doing this for a job like you said if you're going to work at a hospital you're going to have to
					specialize your vocabulary a little bit more than we do just to be able to walk around and eat good
					food and things like that yeah yeah I'm completely happy with where I'm at and I think that's a that
					should be the goal for the average person is to be able to make a joke in your target language right
					yeah and how long did it take you to achieve the level that you have today so let's see I I actually
					looked up I I was prepared for this and I did a little bit of research I looked on I talky which is
					the site that we met on where where you uh taught Spanish and English and my very first class was in
					June of 2020 so wow I talki was really one of the first things where my language learning Journey
					started so I would say that I really started learning Spanish in 2020 uh I don't really count my
					couple months with duo lingo and things like that because I only learned a little bit of vocabulary
					maybe but so I've got uh three and a half years years really really learning and really uh having
					Spanish be a huge part of my life and I would say that after okay so let me just say another stat
					that I looked up earlier you and I actually made a video on YouTube speaking completely in Spanish
					yeah that was in September of 20121 okay so one year and three months after I started we had a very
					fluent completely conversational Spanish language video so uh after a year I would say that I was
					speaking very well but we're going to get into this more and more what it takes but how long it's
					going to take you to learn a language comes down to how obsessed you're going to be with that
					language thank you thank you it it goes down to it comes down to how much effort and studies and
					time you're willing to put into this language and can I just say that for you to have the level that
					you had after one year and even today three years later is impressive and it's not common I've
					taught students who have studied Spanish for year studied English anyway for years and can't
					maintain a conversation it all comes down to how do you study is this a part of your daily life are
					you just reading from a textbook are you going to class once a week how are you studying so that's
					actually what I want to ask you we were studying Spanish well I was teaching you Spanish for about a
					year and a half two years what were you doing outside of the classroom to support your Spanish
					studies so that's an important thing to understand uh the class that we were doing was important for
					me because we were able to practice and that is he having somebody who you could practice with right
					yeah but if you're not doing anything outside of one class a week you're going to be one of those
					people who are learning for years and not able to hold a conversation absolutely so what it comes
					down to like we've we've just said is how much time you're going to put in are you going to be
					obsessed with it are you going to live it so I dove right in okay I was spending hours every day so
					I was blessed to have a job where I had a little bit of downtime at work so I could watch a movie in
					Spanish I could watch shows so I would say for that year that year and a half that we were that I
					really made this big Improvement on my worst days where I spent just the least amount of time I was
					spending an hour consuming content Spanish and on good days three hours three and a half hours
					because it was very important to me and I really wanted it and when you really want a goal you'll
					make the time and you'll find a way to get it so I was obsessed I was obsessed and the results spoke
					for themselves I would you know I actually love that you're saying that you have to become obsessed
					with learning a language if you want to achieve flu fluency quick right and I can say the same thing
					about my Spanish journey I was obsessed with Spanish I did everything in Spanish I only watched
					shows in Spanish I only listened to music in Spanish I only traveled to Spanish-speaking countries
					most of the new people that I met I wanted to speak Spanish with them I tried to you know hang out
					with Latinos so I became obsessed with this goal of like I am going to speak Spanish now guys you
					don't have to be obsessive like us if whatever you just want to learn Spanish as a hobby but if you
					don't make the language a part of your life you have to understand that you're not going to learn to
					be fluent quickly yeah absolutely there's uh a title of a book that I saw that applies to this and
					it is be obsessed or be average so I actually love that that is My Philosophy with languages be
					obsessed or be average yeah and I mean if you want to be average that's okay but personally when it
					comes to learning languages I want to be fluent I want to have a conversation I want to understand
					about the culture I want to like the food I want to listen to music I want to understand the jokes
					right so it's it's living in that language and guys the hard work pays off when you can go into a
					restaurant and speak that language with the the staff and really connect with these new people once
					you can start having these experiences you will not regret spending the time learning language right
					and so my question for you is what's your first thought when you see videos or influencers promising
					I'll help you become fluent in English or Spanish in three months learn a new language in three
					months Liars listen it someone had to say it y'all it wasn't me but someone had to say it it's a lie
					not realistic even if you are obsessed if you are completely obsessed and like diving in and being
					part of this culture and language like we we're talking about now three months you'll maybe start to
					understand some words and be able to introduce yourself maybe read a little bit guys you these
					people who are saying I got uh fluent in Spanish in three months what they're not telling you was
					they took two years in College of it they had a base they grew up around it or they already speak
					fluent Italian or fluent Portuguese if you speak fluent Portuguese sure you could learn Spanish in a
					few months if you're obsessed with it yeah but for me to say I I learned Russian in 3 months and now
					I'll show you how by my course that's a lie so that's a really good point too to talk about is what
					language are you learning and what is your native language is it possible to learn a new language in
					three months yes it's possible but what languages do you already speak and what language are you
					learning I studied Spanish for many years I studied Spanish for four years in University four years
					in University I moved to a Spanish-speaking country so I learned fluent Spanish and then I took an
					accelerated Portuguese course and learned Portuguese in three months because I had the base of
					Spanish and because Spanish and Portuguese are such similar languages and because I was obsessed
					with Portuguese so it's all of those factors is it possible to learn a language in three months yeah
					it is but learn a language that's similar to your native language or to a language that you already
					speak and put in the work absolutely and I had a similar experience with Portuguese having already
					learned Spanish and a lot of French uh I did a I actually did a one month challenge in Portuguese
					and by the end of that one month I was able to have a very basic conversation but that was being
					obsessed every day consuming a ton of content and already being fluent in Spanish and having a ton
					of French vocabulary as well absolutely so pay attention to the language you want to learn if you
					want to add another language to your toolbox learn one that's similar that's going to be easy to
					learn but something that I always tell my students is who ask me I want to become fluent in English
					now how long will it take I tell them if they're if they're referencing the three months become
					fluent in three months courses I'm not going to promise you that I'm going to help you be fluent in
					three months because I'm not going to lie to you I'm not going to lie to my students in 3 months you
					can maintain a conversation a basic conversation if you are at a zero level you can maintain a base
					level conversation and that's if you're putting in the work and studying the materials that I send
					you outside of class if you come to class once a week don't do the homework don't practice with
					anyone you're G to take forever to learn the language you're going to take a few years and that's
					just being realistic or maybe never or maybe maybe never if you don't put in the work absolutely
					yeah well this next question is going to be really really useful for you guys to learn a language
					and to learn quickly and efficiently but before I ask Kyle and get his insights go give this video a
					like subscribe to my channel subscribe to Kyle's Channel Bando and let us know in the comment
					section down below what language are you learning and how long did it take you to learn that
					language so a lot of my students come to the first class and tell me that they want to speak like
					native speakers they ask me how long is it going to take me to have a native accent what do you
					think about this I have a lot of thoughts about this okay we need to be proud of who we are okay if
					you are a Mexican learning English be proud of that okay because taking the time to learn a new
					language is one of the coolest things you could do it shows a huge amount of respect to the people
					you're trying to speak with and I think that an accent is character okay I I love the way I sound in
					Spanish and I sound like uh someone from the United States speaking Spanish a gringo yeah I'm a
					gringo but I speak Spanish and uh you know when I was spending a lot of time around Mexicans my
					Spanish had a lot of Mex Mexican vocabulary because different countries use different words my wife
					is Colombian now maybe I use more Colombian words but my accent is neutral I don't speak like I'm
					from Argentina I don't speak like I'm from Mexico because I'm not and I don't try to be when I think
					focusing too much on your accent rather than focusing on acquiring new words new vocabulary a better
					understanding is a big mistake and I think you should just be proud of who you are and speak speak
					your language with pride with your chest out your chin up and be proud of how you sound because
					you're working hard and you don't have to try and sound like a native speaker because you're not
					I'll never be a native Spanish speaker I'm not I'm an English speaker who speaks Spanish and I'm
					proud of that I love that be proud of your heritage be proud of your Origins yes work on your accent
					so that people can understand you because it's true that if you have a conversation with an English
					speaker and you're speaking English with a complete Spanish accent okay there's going to be some
					misunderstandings we're going to have a hard time understanding you but don't try to lose your
					accent your accent is your heritage your accent is your origin be proud of that and also think about
					why am I so obsessed with losing my accent yeah I agree and I I think like you said pronunciation
					completely important but some people say oh I want to learn uh I'm you know I'm a Spanish learner so
					people say oh I want to speak with a uh Spain accent or a Mexican accent to me it's more important
					to learn the words and learn to pronounce to uh pronounce the words well but having sounding like
					you're from a certain country country don't be a poser be you be who you are and it might be a
					disservice if you spend too much time trying to change your accent and you spend too much energy
					trying to change your accent when you could just be learning more and be focusing your energy on
					learning more words and I think part of the reason why I love Spanish language is because it's so
					diverse and in every country they have their own sling their own accent even within that country
					they have different regions with different accents and that all is just it's this whole diverse
					world right and we can acquire a little bit from every place and okay sometimes people aren't always
					going to understand us but as Kyle said it's just adding more character to our language absolutely
					yeah all right so what are your top tips for Learners to learn English or Spanish quickly and
					efficiently so I'm all about using your time well okay we're we're busy if you're watching this I'm
					sure you have uh maybe a job maybe uh a family a relationship Hobbies we've got stuff to do right
					school you're in University you're taking classes we've all got responsibilities so when you're
					driving in the car you need to be listening when you're going for a walk listening um another thing
					that is so important is enjoying it enjoying the process if you are enjoying everything you do
					you're going to absorb that so much better you're going to learn so much faster so we know what we
					like to do in our first languages right you know I like martial arts I have hobbies outside of
					language learning so if I'm going to watch a video on YouTube about martial arts why not do it in
					Spanish so integrate or add your your target language into the things that you would normally do in
					your first language and you'll be successful I love that I totally love that do your hobbies in your
					second language absolutely make the process enjoyable yeah absolutely what kind of resources would
					you recommend like would you recommend dual lingo and these kind of apps for language Learners I
					don't want to disrespect du lingo but it's not the most efficient one that I have found so what I
					will say is if you are just starting your first day with a new language du lingo is cool Doo right
					just take the step just take that step yeah because you are going to get some exposure you're going
					to learn new words and in order to use the more advanced resources which are a lot better you're
					going to need that little base so dual lingo is not a bad place to start and hey it's free it's free
					I understand that sometimes we don't have the extra resources to spend on apps or things like that
					so there's nothing wrong with using du lingo that's free looking up a free course on YouTube nothing
					wrong with that and then later maybe you're in a little bit better financial situation you go take a
					class with Emma you could go use a more advanced application okay uh but for me the best app that I
					found is called link and that is the uh polyglot Steve Kaufman he's pretty big around the language
					learning world uh he has a reading app called link and I've learned so much from that app I love to
					read so that's incredible uh comprehensible input is incredible that's what I do on my channel for
					anybody who speaks Spanish and is learning English come check me out I have hours and hours of
					content there and you could really these days you could find comprehensible input for whatever
					language you're learning yeah I've used Spanish and French and if you're using comprehensible input
					you find whatever app works for you whatever I like might not work for you guys so I love to read if
					you don't like like to read Link's not going to work for you yeah find what you like and use it use
					it it's all about finding what works for you right making it enjoyable for you personalizing it for
					you and exploring and just getting started get started with dual lingo and then start researching
					there's so many language YouTubers out there that are creating content about learning a language any
					language right me Kyle so just expose yourself more and once you start learning languages and you
					fall in love with the process I think that you'll never go back you'll never go back it's it's a
					whole world so learn that language just get started take the step don't worry about getting fluent
					in three months don't worry about losing your accent just go for it and have fun and fall in love
					with the process well Kyle thank you for your time thank you for your insights my pleasure thank you
					for having me once again again I'm so happy to speak with you it's been too long and I love this
					stuff I love it so I'm I'm more than happy to share it and it's it's super interesting for me I hope
					some of you guys will put this stuff to use and when you learn a language you improve your life it's
					an adventure it's a skill it's a superpower yeah I totally agree with you language learning changes
					your life and language learning is my biggest passion and I just recommend everyone to try it out
					and see if you like it so and I think you really share that passion as well so it's really helped us
					for the better and I think that it can help all of you if you guys take the step and and let it
					absolutely put in that work guys put in the work give this video a like subscribe to this this
					channel go find Kyle on YouTube Bando and I will see you next week bye
