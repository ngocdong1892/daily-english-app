					knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to meet the project requirements and achieve the desired
					outcome.<br />So how does that actually happen?<br />Well, that’s where you come in.<br />Project
					managers usually follow a process that involves planning and organizing, managing tasks, budgeting
					and
					controlling costs, and other factors so that the project can be completed within the approved budget
					and
					time frame.<br />Let’s break these down into examples of responsibilities that you might find in a
					job
					listing for a project management role.<br />We’ll start with planning and organizing.<br />One
					responsibility that falls under the umbrella of planning and organizing is making use of
					productivity
					tools and creating processes.<br />During the planning and execution of a project, you might need to
					use
					certain tools and develop processes to improve information sharing across the team.<br />You may
					also
					need to create plans, timelines, schedules, and other forms of documentation to track project
					completion.<br />And you’ll usually need to maintain those documents throughout the entirety of the
					project.<br />The next task is budgeting and controlling costs and other factors.<br />As the
					project is
					underway, changes to the plan and budget are bound to come up.<br />Believe me.<br />This will
					require
					you to monitor and manage the budget, track issues and risks as they arise, and manage quality by
					mitigating those issues and risks.<br />One way to do this is by removing unforeseen barriers that
					come
					up.<br />Now, by barriers, we mean things that can get in the way of project progress.<br />For
					example,
					if your teammates lack the resources needed to complete a task, you might identify that issue or
					barrier
					upfront, escalate the issue to a stakeholder, and work to secure the resource so your team can move
					forward.<br />Another huge piece of the project manager’s role is managing tasks.<br />A project
					task is
					an activity that needs to be accomplished within a set period of time by you, your team, or your
					stakeholders.<br />Keeping track of tasks is a great way to help manage the team’s workload and
					ensure
					that things are getting done.<br />Keeping track of tasks is also a great tool for demonstrating
					progress to people outside the immediate team, like your stakeholders.<br />Back when I was a
					program
					manager in student development here at Google, one of our goals was to create pathways for students
					who
					identify with communities that are underrepresented in the technology industry.<br />A large part of
					my
					day-to-day responsibilities involved working with two separate engineering teams to create our
					technical
					curriculum.<br />To manage the tasks associated with this project, I created separate project
					trackers
					for each team that outlined the vision for the curriculum.<br />These trackers kept both teams in
					the
					loop about the timeline for delivery, the categories and subcategories for work, and the team
					members
					assigned to each task.<br />I also made sure to update our stakeholders every step of the
					way.<br />By
					actively managing tasks throughout the project life cycle, I was able to keep tabs on everyone’s
					work
					and efficiently inform stakeholders, which allowed us to achieve our project goal with minimal
					issues.<br /></p>
