					episode  thank you hello my friends hello I'm Kyle my mission here in my channel pensando
					English is to bring you guys real English that you can understand okay and today I'm going to
					continue with my mission and tell you guys about something that I know a lot about okay I know a lot
					about this how do I know about this because I am this okay I am going to talk about what it is like
					to be a single father okay and I'm in my car my car because I am waiting to pick up my son to pick
					up my son from school okay Escuela  so I'm here waiting to pick up my son and I thought hmm I
					think I should use this time to make a video because I do not do not like to waste time so today I'm
					going to talk about my experiences and what I think it is like to be a single parent okay so there
					are a lot of single parents in the world there are a lot of single mothers single mothers who take
					care of kids and raise children by themselves but I do not think that there are as many single
					fathers who take care of their kids okay so I'm a single father and my son lives with me he does not
					live with his mom he lives with me so I take care of my son I take care of my son every day but um I
					am lucky I'm very lucky because my mom helps me so much my son has a great amazing grandmother una
					super abuela okay so thank you Mom thank you so much Mom for helping us so my mom helps a lot but my
					son lives with me and if I am not working my son is with me and I'm taking care of him so uh being a
					single father it's hard because there are a lot of responsibilities responsibilities okay to raise a
					child there's a lot of responsibilities what are some of the responsibilities okay so if they're
					they're a little child a baby baby a baby you have to change their diapers okay I changed a lot of
					diapers when my son was younger now my son is seven years old so I do not change diapers but some of
					the responsibilities that I have now for taking care of my son my responsibilities as a single
					father uh so to feed your child okay they three times a day so I have to make sure that there is
					good healthy food in the house for my son uh my son loves to eat fruit he loves fruit he loves
					yogurt okay so I have to make sure there's a whole lot of fruit in the house always and there's
					yogurt and my I also like to make sure he gets healthy meat and eggs so he could be strong so um you
					have to make food for them okay here in the United States it's sad it's sad triste it's sad but a
					lot of people like to give their kids just McDonald's all the time or junk food and candy and my son
					he he loves candy and he he loves McDonald's too but most days I give him good healthy food I make
					sure he eats a lot of fruit I'll make sure he eats some eggs or some meat okay I make sure that my
					son eats healthy food another responsibility is you have to make sure that your child is clean okay
					you have to make sure that your child takes a bath okay or a shower that they brush their teeth that
					they wash their hands after they go to the bathroom okay you always have to make sure that your
					child is clean all right you have to make sure that your child has clean clothes to wear clean
					clothes to wear so you have to do laundry okay and wash the clothes to do laundry means to wash
					clothes another responsibility that I have is I have to take my son to school I have to take him to
					school and I have to come and pick him up after school when he's done so I take my son to school I
					pick him up when he's done and in the morning I have to make him a lunch some food I make him a
					lunch that he could take with him to school another responsibility that a parent has if your child
					is in school is homework okay homework is tarea okay so after school my son has homework so I have
					to help him with that and make sure that he does it okay uh my son is seven so he does math
					mathematics he reads he writes okay he's a smart boy and I'm very proud of him but it's still a
					responsibility to tell him hey you have to do your homework and if he has questions preguntas you
					have to help him another responsibility if you want to be a good parent is you have to make sure
					that even when they're not in school they're learning so I'd make sure to buy books I'd buy books
					for our home so that he could read when we're at home and he's learning that way I have a
					application on an iPad unable application that teaches kids Spanish my son is learning Spanish
					because I want him to be learning okay so those are some of the responsibilities of being a single
					parent okay so there are a lot of things that you have to do to take care of your child you have to
					give them food make sure they're clean give them clean clothes take them to school help them with
					their homework make sure that they are learning new things okay and another thing Ultra is you have
					to play with them okay you have to playos okay so my son he doesn't have brothers and sisters no
					tiene Hermanos so he always wants to play jugar Siempre but he has no brothers and sisters to play
					with so he comes and asks me that I want to play can we play can we play can we play yeah and a
					child does not care okay they do not care if you are tired if you worked all day okay no important
					to Nino okay and they do not care if you worked all day or you're tired children want to play they
					want to be happy and have fun so uh you have to try and play with your kid too so I try my best to
					play with him sometimes I'm tired because I work so much so I tell him I can't son I'm sorry right
					now you can go play on your iPad for a little bit or watch some TV and after I relax for a little
					bit we'll play so because I'm a single father and my son is always with me he's always with me we
					have to find fun cool things to do together so what do we do together we we do a lot of cool stuff
					together we go fishing with my friends okay we go fishing we go to the gym El gymnasio because the
					gym that I go to they have a place for kids so I go and work out and my son goes and plays with
					other kids at the gym so we go to the gym together he loves it he he loves to go to the gym because
					he gets to see other kids and I like it too because I get to work out okay exercise my son has a
					YouTube channel too like me so we make videos for him too so that's something really fun that we do
					together I'm gonna put a small little clip of one of my son's videos so that you guys can see
					because I think it's cute I think it's cool and I I love that he does it so I want to show you guys
					just a little video that we made together okay here it is I heard something in my room I think The
					Smiler might be back I'm gonna go check it out pretty scared pretty scared what I might find in here
					no I don't see anything in here I don't see anything in my room what let's see anything in here whoa
					okay so we we try and find fun things to do we go to Parks we go to uh stores and look for cool toys
					we go to the bookstore and buy new books okay so we do a lot of cool stuff together my son is my
					best friend and uh I think because I'm a single father and I've been taking care of him alone with
					my mom's help but he's been living with me for four years now I think we are so close we are so
					close uh because I do everything for him and he is always with me so we have a relationship so close
					okay and I'm very grateful for that I love my son more than anything in the world he's my best
					friend uh sometimes it's hard to be a single parent sometimes it's hard but I'm very proud I'm proud
					of uh the job that I've done I think that I've done a good job I try my best sometimes it's hard and
					I don't do so good um but I try my best and I'm proud of myself I'm proud of my son and uh being a
					single parent is difficult so one tip that I want to tell you guys you who maybe are your younger
					mosh Hoven and don't have kids yet something that I wish I would have thought of um okay so if you
					want to have a kid if you want uh to have a son or a daughter only do it with somebody who you love
					very much somebody who is a good person okay because if you have a kid with somebody who is not a
					good person and then you break up you're going to be a single parent and it's it's very difficult
					situation okay so I I hope that if you guys have children you have it with somebody you love and you
					work together and be a team and be a mom and a dad together to raise your children and if you you
					guys who are watching this if you have kids and you're a single parent good job good job my friends
					very good job awesome I know that it's hard keep on doing a good job and be proud of yourselves okay
					so my friends I just wanted to tell you guys my experiences and my thoughts about being a single
					father or a single parent I hope that you guys enjoyed this video and like I said to my single
					parents out there salute because I know that it is hard keep on taking good care of those kids we're
					doing a good thing okay and to everybody else sweaters pronto
