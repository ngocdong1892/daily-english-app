					hello my friends hello again I I am Kyle and here here on my channel panu Eng I bring you real
					English real English that you can understand real English that you can understand and today today
					I'm going to talk about something that I'm excited about I really want to do a good job with this
					because it's it's important I think it's very important and that is is I'm going to talk about why I
					want to and how I am going to teach my son Spanish okay let's start with why why do I want to teach
					my son to speak Spanish well there are several reasons and the first the first reason that I want to
					teach my son to speak Spanish is because Spanish is such a huge part of my life okay it's a part of
					my life that is very special to me near and dear to my heart it is something that I love and it is
					something that has improve my life in so many different ways that I want to be able to share it with
					my son I want to be able to speak Spanish with him I want to be able to watch cool shows and movies
					with him I want to be able to go to events in Spanish with him I want to be able to travel to
					Spanish speaking places with him I want to be able to go and eat um awesome Spanish food in places
					where they speak Spanish and I want him to be able to really enjoy these things with me as he grows
					older and older and not need me to translate for him I want him to be able to have firsthand
					experiences of these different cultures and because it's so important to me I want to share that
					with my son next reason is because languages make you more interesting they make you a more
					interesting person so my son is 8 years old right now okay he is eight so imagine if he can speak
					speak fluent Spanish by the time he is 12 he will be such a cool little 12-year-old I wish that I
					could speak a different language when I was 12 he will have so many more opportunities for
					friendships experiences relationships entertainment and in the future jobs also knowing another
					language is something that will give him confidence and something awesome about himself that he can
					be proud of because like I said in my video about confidence learning things having interesting
					things to talk about make you a more confident person and I want that for my son and the last reason
					that I'm going to talk about for why I want to teach my son Spanish is because we will probably be
					spending a lot of time in the future in Colombia okay it is very likely that we will be traveling
					there at Le at least once a year for the future because I married a Colombian woman okay I married a
					Colombian woman and of course we're going to want to visit her family maybe spend some time over
					there so when I go with my wife to Columbia I want my son to come come with of course because we are
					a family and I do not want him to be there and not understand what people are saying and feel like
					he's left out of the conversations or the fun things we're doing he doesn't understand the jokes
					everybody else will be laughing ha and he'll just be sitting there bored I don't want that when we
					travel one day to Colombia I want my son to be able to interact with the people with my wife's
					family make friends and this is another thing that I think will be an incredible experience for my
					son if he has these experiences while he's young he will grow into a well-rounded well-rounded
					cultured open minded individual and that's what I want for my boy okay so what is my plan to do it
					how do I plan on teaching my son Spanish so I am lucky I am lucky my wife speaks Spanish I speak
					with her all the time my son hears us speaking Spanish all the time so he picks up he picks up
					little pieces okay and as he starts to build a base he's going to pick up and understand more and
					more so he's going to have input coming all the time all right so that is one advantage that we have
					the specific strategies that I am going to use to personally teach him are the following so I bought
					these Spanish flash cards okay this is a flash card on one side it says Spanish and it shows the
					picture on the other side it says English and these that I bought there are 56 of them so that's 56
					words and they are very common words so this this is going to really start building his base and
					after I finish telling you guys my reasons and how I plan on doing this I'm going to show you my son
					and I practicing these flash cards for the first time so I think these are going to be a fun way for
					him to really build to start to build a vocabulary of very useful things like sapatos Hugo leche
					okay these are the very basic words words that he is going to need to know to start building a base
					in Spanish also I am going to look into fun applications and games for him maybe you heard him he's
					in the other room playing a game right now in Spanish okay it's a game on his virtual reality
					headset I hear him right now and it sounds like he's having fun so that's great that means he's
					picking up a little bit of the language and he's enjoying himself so I'm going to let let him play
					on his headset have some fun that way pick up a little bit of Spanish and I'm also going to look
					into other applications on my phone that may be fun for him fun ways to start building a vocabulary
					and understanding a little bit how the language works and after he's got a solid base with a good
					vocabulary he starts to uh to know a lot of words for the things that he's seeing we'll start
					watching cartoons start watching movies that he has already seen in English Disney movies and things
					like that we'll start watching them together in Spanish and this will be comprehensible input we're
					going to work on these flashcards we're going to I'm going to let him play fun games in Spanish on
					his headset on my phone and then we're going to work on comprehensible input and by that I mean
					watching cartoons shows he already likes but in Spanish and movies that he has already seen But in
					in Spanish and like I said my wife and I will always be speaking Spanish so he's going to hear a lot
					of that which will be a huge Advantage for him and I've also told my wife that I want her to start
					speaking to him more and more because he really tries his best to understand her because he loves
					her so much so that's great okay guys I've told you the reasons why I want my son to learn Spanish I
					told you my plan for how I'm going to do it now let's see how my son does with these flash cards all
					right guys so we're going to start to build my son Conor's vocabulary with some English and Spanish
					flash cards but first he has a little something that he wants to show you guys you could go up to
					the camera and show them I made a little robot out of clay he's so cute all right buddy come on
					subscribe if you think the little robot's cute and comment hit cute robot if you like him okay put
					your robot down buddy okay guys so I bought these flash cards that are in English and in Spanish to
					start building Connor's vocabulary in Spanish these are really cool in the the pack that I bought
					there's 56 different flash cards there's 56 different flashcards so that means there's 56 different
					words that he can learn in Spanish but for today for the first lesson for our first time practicing
