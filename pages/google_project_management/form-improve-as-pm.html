					effort
					to improve products or services.<br />It helps ensure that a product steadily makes its way toward
					the
					best possible outcome.<br />Continuous improvement begins with recognizing when processes and tasks
					need
					to be created, eliminated, or improved.<br />Then a project manager must plan for and implement
					changes
					to keep the project on track.<br />That’s where process improvement comes from.<br />Process
					improvement
					is the practice of identifying, analyzing, and improving existing processes to enhance the
					performance
					of your team and to develop best practices or to optimize consumer experiences.<br />When working
					through process improvements, using a controlled environment in an experiment can help you
					understand if
					the changes you’re considering fix your problem.<br />A control is an experiment or observation
					designed
					to minimize the effects of variables.<br />Control groups are representative samples that help you
					to
					determine that the differences between your experimental groups and the norm are due to your changes
					rather than something else.<br />They eliminate alternative explanations for your results.<br />If
					you
					aren’t familiar with this, that’s OK, because I’ll break it down for you.<br />For example, you
					observe
					a problem with your process and put forward a hypothesis, which is an educated guess about what’s
					causing the problem and how you’d fix it.<br />Then, you change one variable in the system, keeping
					the
					control group the same, and observe your results again.<br />Let’s put this in the context of
					Project
					Plant Pal’s scenario.<br />Business is booming for Office Green, and demand for your team’s new
					Plant
					Pal service is rapidly growing.<br />To meet the demand, suppliers have streamlined their process of
					packing boxes and putting all plants into a one-size-fits-all box.<br />Let’s say you’re using just
					one
					box size to ship all of your plants.<br />For smaller plants, there’s more padding added to the box
					to
					fill the extra space, and the plants usually arrive intact.<br />But larger plants have to be
					squeezed
					into the boxes and sometimes arrive damaged, according to customer surveys.<br />To fix this
					problem,
					you hypothesize a potential solution by posing a question.<br />Would more of the large plants
					arrived
					intact if they were shipped in bigger boxes using the same padding we used for the small
					plants?<br />Here’s where your control comes in.<br />You continue to ship half of the larger plants
					in
					the original boxes.<br />This is your control group, and you experiment by shipping the other half
					in
					bigger boxes.<br />Nothing else is different about the boxes except the size.<br />The shape,
					thickness,
					box supplier, delivery addresses, absolutely everything else stays exactly the same.<br />After the
					larger plants are delivered, you conduct a new survey.<br />If more larger plants arrived intact,
					your
					hypothesis is confirmed.<br />If the results are the same as they were before the experiment, you’ll
					need to try something else to solve the problem of your damaged plants.<br />Working in a controlled
					environment isn’t the only way to ensure continuous improvements.<br />There are various data-driven
					improvement frameworks like DMAIC and PDCA.<br />We’re going to keep on that same path of uncovering
					methods for continuous improvements.<br />We’ll start with data-driven improvement
					frameworks.<br />Data
					driven improvement frameworks are techniques used to make decisions based on actual data.<br />The
					first
					data-driven improvement framework we’ll cover may be familiar to you since we discussed it in a
					previous
					course.<br />Recall that D-M-A-I-C, or DMAIC, stands for define, measure, analyze, improve, and
					control.<br />And it maps out to five steps that you can take when working toward continuous
					improvements.<br />So when considering how you can improve customer experiences, start with the
					following.<br />First, you’ll need to define the business problem– goals, resources, project scope,
					and
					project timeline.<br />Next– measure.<br />Here, you’ll conduct performance metrics and data
					collection
					to establish baselines and measure success.<br />Then– analyze.<br />Work to find the root causes of
					problems and understand their impact.<br />Next– improve.<br />This means implementing a reasonable
					solution to the problem.<br />Lastly– control.<br />This is where you’ll implement the changes and
					stay
					on top of monitoring the updated processes you’ve established.<br />Another framework you can refer
					to
					when working through continuous improvements is PDCA.<br />PDCA is a four-step process that focuses
					on
					identifying a problem, fixing that issue, assessing whether the fix was successful, and fine tuning
					the
					final fix.<br />The steps are as follows.<br />First- plan.<br />Here, you’ll identify the issue and
					root cause and brainstorm solutions to the problem.<br />Let’s say that one type of plant isn’t
					selling
					well, which means the warehouse is full of a particular species.<br />If you don’t do something
					fast,
					the plants may die soon.<br />So what are some viable solutions?<br />You propose moving the items
					from
					the bottom of the sales page on the website to the top, so those plants are front and
					center.<br />You
					could also send out email marketing campaigns featuring that plant where you offer customers a buy
					one,
					get one offer on the plant.<br />Second– do or fix the problem.<br />In this case, your sponsor
					decided
					that they didn’t feel comfortable giving plants away if they could still profit.<br />So you’ve
					decided
					to go with the first option, moving the plant to a more prominent part of the website.<br />Your
					hypothesis is that the best way to shift older inventory is to put it in a place that customers
					can’t
					miss.<br />The next part of this framework is check.<br />Compare your results to the goal to find
					out
					if the problem is fixed.<br />Now you wait one week and notice if the sales numbers go up for that
					plant.<br />If they did, your hypothesis is correct, and you’ve saved some plant lives and helped
					Office
					Green avoid financial loss.<br />Nice job.<br />And finally– act or fine tune the fix to ensure
					continuous improvement.<br />In our example, you decide to reorganize the website.<br />In the
					future,
					all overstocked plants will get a prominent place on the website.<br />Both PDCA and DMAIC are great
					problem-solving frameworks to apply in your day to day life and in the workplace.<br />These
					frameworks
					help you to identify issues, reduce errors, and optimize your processes.<br />I encourage you to
					think
					about these techniques next time you encounter a problem or notice room for improvement within a
					workflow.<br />You’ll be surprised at how a simple framework can help set you up for
					success.<br />Awesome.<br />Now you know more about advocating for and creating continuous
					improvements.<br />We also defined and went through some examples of using frameworks DMAIC and PDCA
					for
					process improvements.<br /></p>
