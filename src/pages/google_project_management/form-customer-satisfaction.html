					Institute, it’s been found that most projects experience a communication breakdown of some kind,
					even
					though project managers spend about 90% of their time working on communication alone.<br />It’s in a
					project manager’s best interest to communicate tactfully, not only with the members of their own
					organization, but also with customers and vendors.<br />When done well, strategic communication with
					a
					customer or client can instill a sense of confidence that you’re doing a good job and that you’re a
					trustworthy partner.<br />So how should a project manager approach communication with a
					customer?<br />Using soft skills like negotiation, empathetic listening, and trust building will
					help
					foster a good relationship between you and your customers.<br />And a good project manager knows how
					and
					when to apply these skills.<br />A key practice for negotiation, empathetic listening, and trust
					building is asking questions.<br />It’s important to ask open-ended questions and actively listen to
					understand the customer’s current state versus their desired state and what might help them get from
					here to there.<br />If you ask open-ended questions, you’ll find out where you can make your
					customers
					feel more secure.<br />You’ll be able to negotiate to ensure both of your needs are met, and you’ll
					build the necessary trust to have a successful partnership.<br />High performing project managers
					set
					clear expectations about when they’ll communicate certain things to their customers.<br />For
					example,
					you might want to set an expectation that you’ll provide weekly progress updates to keep clients
					informed, rather than expecting them to come to you with questions.<br />When troubleshooting an
					issue
					with the product, it might not be necessary to fill the customer in on an issue that won’t affect
					the
					outcome.<br />Let’s say a designer on your team quit and you had to replace them.<br />You may be
					able
					to replace that designer with a new one fairly quickly and not even skip a beat in your project’s
					progress.<br />You can complete the task at hand without giving the customer any additional
					worry.<br />The level of visibility between customers and clients on a given project may vary, and
					you’ll have to use your judgment regarding what’s important to communicate to your
					client.<br />Sometimes you’ll want to tell your client if there’s an issue.<br />If you reach a
					point in
					the project where you can’t possibly move forward without their help and input, you’ll have to
					communicate the issue to them calmly and with empathy.<br />Let’s put this into Project Plant Pals
					context, where we’re troubleshooting an issue with broken planters.<br />Maybe, when we were putting
					together our quality standards, we left some room for supplier error and accounted for some broken
					planters.<br />We’ll say we figured an acceptable number of broken planters was 2 out of every
					50.<br />But let’s imagine that the customer received a shipment and there were five broken
					planters.<br />At that point, we’ll need to meet with the customer and ask important negotiation
					questions.<br />We’ll need to decide if the 5 broken planters out of every 50 is an acceptable
					outcome.<br />Or we’ll need to discuss whether the customer would consider investing in a higher
					tier of
					planters that may be less prone to breaking.<br />Presenting a solution like using sturdier planters
					will affect their budget, and they’ll need to adjust accordingly.<br />Is the customer OK with that
					change?<br />Would that lead to another trade-off?<br />Keeping in mind that the main goal here is
					customer satisfaction throughout the negotiation process, you’ll want to be considerate of their
					feelings and limitations.<br />You can do this by exhibiting empathy, understanding their
					frustrations,
					addressing them, and finding a solution that’s beneficial for both of you.<br />You may have held a
					customer-facing role in the past, whether that’s in a call center, as a retail associate, as a
					server in
					a restaurant, or any number of positions.<br />Even if you haven’t, you’ve probably been an advocate
					for
					yourself while conversing with a customer service representative.<br />Because of this, you’ll
					probably
					have a good idea of what good customer service looks like.<br />Good customer service results in
					choosing to go back to the same hair salon, bakery, or coffee shop because you like the way that you
					were treated and the service you received, even if you had an issue, versus choosing not to go back
					to
					those places if you don’t receive that level of care.<br />Your past experiences have taught you to
					manage relationships and to avoid delivering something that’s low quality.<br />It doesn’t feel
					great
					when you’re on the receiving end.<br />In order to yield better results in future projects, it’s
					necessary to get feedback from customers.<br />Sometimes the feedback will come during the process,
					and
					sometimes it’ll come after the project is completed, depending on how you map it out in the
					initiation
					phase.<br />The matter of when you receive feedback may come down to what you actually want to
					accomplish in your project.<br />If your business is launching an e-commerce site, you will want
					user
					feedback so you can make adjustments to optimize the customer’s shopping experience.<br />If your
					business is an on-demand cookie delivery service, you may want to deliver the cookies and then get
					their
					user feedback to know how your customers felt about the cookies and the delivery experience as a
					whole.<br />User feedback helps to close any gaps in understanding between the customer’s
					expectation
					and the project’s needs.<br />So to summarize very briefly, soft skills like negotiation, empathetic
					listening, and trust building will help create a good relationship between you and your customers,
					and
					getting feedback from those customers will help you to iterate on a product or service.<br />As
					promised, we’re going to discuss user testing and feedback.<br />If the end goal of our project is
					to
					have a great quality product or service for both our own organization and our customer, we need to
					get
					an idea of what the customer wants.<br />We already learned how to make sure something is high
					quality
					on our end.<br />Now let’s find out how to measure what clients want so we can meet their needs,
					expectations, and standards.<br />The best way to get an idea of what customers and users want is to
					ask
					them.<br />But we don’t mean calling each of them up on the phone and literally asking
					them.<br />That
					might not be the best use of our time.<br />Fortunately, there are a few ways we can streamline that
					information.<br />We can conduct a series of surveys or tests with customers and users.<br />Some
					common
					ones are feedback surveys and user acceptance tests.<br />Let’s start with feedback
					surveys.<br />Feedback surveys are a survey in which users provide feedback on features of your
					product
					that they like or dislike.<br />These surveys can take place as you design, before you launch, in
					order
					to find out if people like and understand the product, or after you’ve launched if you want to make
					sure
					the user experience is even more satisfying.<br />So your users participate in a survey and give you
					feedback on what features they like or dislike and potentially which aspects they find to be fairly
					intuitive and which aspects are a little tougher to navigate.<br />After you get that feedback,
					you’ll
					either be good to launch, if you haven’t yet, or you’ll go back and iterate on the product if it’s
					already on the market.<br />Alternatively, you might conduct user acceptance tests.<br />In broader
					terms, a User Acceptance Test, or a UAT, is a test that helps a business make sure that a product or
					solution works for its users.<br />A UAT must meet the agreed upon requirements and deliver the
					expected
					results.<br />This test is typically used to assess the end-to-end experience for the user of a new
					process or product.<br />A user acceptance test is incredibly important because it takes place near
					the
					end of a product’s development and therefore is an overall user experience test of the entire
					product,
					software, or service.<br />UATs are sometimes referred to as beta tests.<br />Let’s find out what a
					user
					acceptance test agenda might look like.<br />In a typical UAT setting, you’ll welcome your users and
					thank them for participating.<br />Then you’ll present the product to them.<br />This includes
					discussing testing guidelines and demonstrating how the product works.<br />Next, you’ll start your
					UAT
					test cases, taking your audience through critical user journeys.<br />A critical user journey is the
					sequence of steps a user follows to accomplish tasks in your product.<br />When presenting something
					you’ve built, you must give users a visual representation or mockup of your product, or have them go
					through a demo.<br />For example, if you’re working on a construction-based project and you intend
					to
					replace all appliances and hardware in the home, you’ll want to give the user some sort of vision of
					what that might entail.<br />This could include 3D models, digital blueprints, samples, and
					more.<br />Your UAT demo should focus on a call to action.<br />For instance, the call to action for
					your project may be the need to test hardware in the client’s future home.<br />Maybe the home
					owners
					have requested a dishwasher that can be opened and closed with very little force and doesn’t make
					too
					much noise.<br />In that case, you’ll want to give the client real-life scenarios to work
					within.<br />Ask them to load the dishes and start the wash cycle.<br />Then ask questions like, On
					a
					scale of 1 to 10, how much force was required to open and close the dishwasher?<br />to determine if
					the
					washer meets their expectations.<br />During your presentation and walkthrough of the UAT, you
					should be
					collecting feedback from the users on their overall experience.<br />During this part of testing,
					your
					users will be able to help you identify edge cases.<br />Edge cases are rare outliers that the
					original
					requirements didn’t account for.<br />They deal with the extreme maximums and minimums of
					parameters.<br />For example, imagine that you created an app that allows for unlimited photo
					uploads,
					knowing that users will rarely upload more than 1,000 photos in a single session.<br />How will the
					system deal with someone who actually does upload thousands of photos, or millions, in a single
					upload?<br />It’s unlikely, but it could be disastrous for your software.<br />After identifying
					edge
					cases, the last step of the UAT agenda is to recap your findings, identify bugs or issues, and
					prioritize which issues need to be addressed first.<br />When you’ve addressed the issue and
					determined
					next steps, you’ll be able to close and conclude your user acceptance testing.<br />And there you
					have
					it.<br />So we’ve learned a bit more about the importance of listening to feedback from customers
					and
					discussed some common methods for measuring customer satisfaction, like feedback surveys, user
					acceptance tests, and edge cases.<br />That’s a lot to learn.<br />Keep it up.<br />You’re doing
					great
					so far.<br /></p>
