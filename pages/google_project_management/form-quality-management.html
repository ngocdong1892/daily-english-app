				<p id="1cf468a0-53d4-8106-bd60-f190b0d61db4" class="">SPEAKER: In this program, we’ve discussed that
					when
					you’re managing a project, you always have to consider the triple constraint– time, scope, and
					budget.<br />Each of these three elements will impact the project.<br />And if any one of them
					suffers,
					the overall quality of the project suffers, too.<br />There’s an important distinction between
					quality
					and done.<br />Simply finishing a project isn’t enough.<br />The project must meet the customer’s
					standards of quality, rather than just be completed.<br />Like all things in project management, the
					more effectively you communicate with your team, the more likely your team will produce high quality
					deliverables.<br />So how do we define quality in a project management sense?<br />Quality is when
					you
					fulfill the outlined requirements for the deliverable and meet or exceed the needs or expectations
					of
					your customers.<br />When it comes to quality, it’s important to deliver a product or service that
					meets
					your customers’ needs.<br />To meet their needs, you have to know important quality management
					concepts
					and oversee the implementation of a project management quality plan.<br />To set yourself up for
					success, you should consider the four main concepts of quality management, which are quality
					standards,
					quality planning, quality assurance, and quality control.<br />The quality process begins with
					setting
					quality standards.<br />Quality standards provide requirements, specifications, or guidelines that
					can
					be used to ensure that products, processes, or services are fit for achieving the desired
					outcome.<br />Set quality standards with your team and your customer at the beginning of your
					project.<br />Take the time to define the quality standards and criteria for your current work, so
					that
					your team members and stakeholders understand exactly what they are.<br />After you set those
					well-defined quality standards, you’ll want to check in periodically and make sure everything looks
					OK
					and the requirements are met.<br />Remember that well defined standards and requirements lead to
					less
					rework and schedule delays.<br />Let’s put this in an example using the scenario we’ve been using
					throughout the program.<br />You’re a project manager at Office Green, a company that specializes in
					plant decor for offices and other businesses.<br />And you’re leading a project called Plant Pals, a
					new
					service that will provide top clients with desk friendly plants.<br />Here’s an example of a few
					quality
					standards for this project.<br />Reliability standards– each planter arrives by the agreed upon time
					and
					in good condition, ready to be placed at a desk.<br />And the suppliers have enough plants in their
					warehouses to fulfill the customer demand on time.<br />Usability standards– planters won’t cause
					customers allergic reactions or illness and will be suitable for all people and animals, if
					necessary.<br />Similarly, you may have product standards.<br />The supplier should meet your
					brand’s
					look and feel, use the specified materials, and be delivered intact.<br />You should adhere to
					quality
					standards across all products and processes.<br />For instance, you may have usability standards
					implemented in the website development process by stating that the website must be easy to navigate,
					whether from a phone, computer, or tablet.<br />Next up, quality planning.<br />Quality planning
					refers
					specifically to the actions of a project manager, or the team, to establish and conduct a process
					for
					identifying and determining exactly which standards of quality are in fact relevant to the project
					as a
					whole and how to satisfy them.<br />To steer that discussion, you can ask yourself, what outcome do
					my
					customers want at the end of this project?<br />What does quality look like for them?<br />How can I
					meet their expectations?<br />And how will I determine if the quality measures will lead to project
					success?<br />This is where you’ll plan the procedures to achieve the quality standards.<br />Recall
					that one of the project Plant Pals quality standards is reliability, the expectation that each plant
					arrives on time and in good condition.<br />So as a quality planning measure, you’ll need to make
					plans
					with your plant provider to test the durability of your planters before you decide to use
					them.<br />The
					third concept of quality management is quality assurance.<br />Quality assurance, often shortened to
					QA,
					is all about evaluating if your project is moving towards delivering a high quality service or
					product.<br />Unlike quality standards and quality planning, QA spans the whole project lifecycle,
					rather than taking place at a specific phase.<br />Your quality plan should include regular audits
					to
					confirm that everything is going to plan and the necessary procedures are being
					followed.<br />Regular
					check ins and reporting to stakeholders will help boost their confidence, and yours, along the
					way.<br />Quality assurance is where you’ll make sure that you and your clients are getting the
					exact
					product you contracted for.<br />So at project Plant Pals, this is where your team will inspect
					options
					for planters, and perhaps, sit in on the durability testing.<br />If you make plans for your plant
					provider to handle the durability testing on their own, make sure you are tracking their progress
					and
					checking in regularly.<br />The final concept of quality management is quality control, often
					shortened
					to QC.<br />Here, techniques are used in order to ensure quality standards when a problem is
					identified,
					or if the quality plan is not executed in the desired manner, and corrective actions should be
					affected.<br />Quality control involves monitoring project results and delivery to determine if
					they’re
					meeting desired results or not.<br />If not, then alternative actions should be taken.<br />Quality
					control is also integral to creating a more successful landing for the next project.<br />After the
					plants are placed throughout the customers offices, quality control may look like you or your team
					member taking a final walkthrough of the offices where the plants were delivered.<br />You’d be
					checking
					for things like broken planters or plants that were damaged in transit, and swapping them out when
					necessary.<br />You may not do this for every customer.<br />But it’s a good idea to do it as you’re
					starting out, in case you spot issues to improve upon when you’re back in the office.<br />If you
					stuck
					to your quality plan, checking on quality throughout the lifecycle of your project, QA, and of
					course,
					correcting as needed, QC, the likelihood of meeting your quality standards is high, resulting in a
					high
					quality deliverable at the end of your project that satisfies your organizational goals and exceeds
					the
					customer’s expectations.<br />And there you have it, quality management.<br />Great!<br />So now
					we’ve
					learned more about how to identify and explain the concept of quality management, which include
					quality
					standards, quality planning, quality assurance, and quality control.<br />By now, you probably
					understand that communication is paramount to a project’s successful landing.<br />It’s the
					lifeblood of
					the whole project.<br />Communication starts before the project even begins and carries on steadily
					throughout the remainder of the project.<br />In this video, I’m going to explain how using soft
					skills
					like negotiation, delivering messages with empathy, and asking questions for clarity, helps to
					foster
					and strengthen communication.<br />We’ll also discuss feedback as a foundation for iterating on a
					product.<br />According to the Project Management Institute, it’s been found that most projects
					experience a communication breakdown of some kind, even though project managers spend about 90% of
					their
					time working on communication alone.<br />It’s in a project manager’s best interest to communicate
					tactfully, not only with the members of their own organization, but also with customers and
					vendors.<br />When done well, strategic communication with a customer or client can instill a sense
					of
					confidence that you’re doing a good job and that you’re a trustworthy partner.<br />So how should a
					project manager approach communication with a customer?<br />Using soft skills like negotiation,
					empathetic listening, and trust building, will help foster a good relationship between you and your
					customers.<br />And a good project manager knows how and when to apply these skills.<br />A key
					practice
					for negotiation, empathetic listening, and trust building, is asking questions.<br />It’s important
					to
					ask open ended questions and actively listen to understand the customers’ current state versus their
					desired state, and what might help them get from here to there.<br />If you ask open ended
					questions,
					you’ll find out where you can make your customers feel more secure.<br />You’ll be able to negotiate
					to
					ensure both of your needs are met.<br />And you’ll build the necessary trust to have a successful
					partnership.<br />High performing project managers set clear expectations about when they’ll
					communicate
					certain things to their customers.<br />For example, you might want to set an expectation that
					you’ll
					provide weekly progress updates to keep clients informed, rather than expecting them to come to you
					with
					questions.<br />When troubleshooting an issue with the product, it might not be necessary to fill
					the
					customer in on an issue that won’t affect the outcome.<br />Let’s say a designer on your team quit
					and
					you had to replace them.<br />You may be able to replace that designer with a new one fairly quickly
					and
					not even skip a beat in your project’s progress.<br />You can complete the task at hand, without
					giving
					the customer any additional worry.<br />The level of visibility between customers and clients on a
					given
					project may vary.<br />And you’ll have to use your judgment regarding what’s important to
					communicate to
					your client.<br />Sometimes, you’ll want to tell your client if there’s an issue.<br />If you reach
					a
					point in the project where you can’t possibly move forward without their help and input, you’ll have
					to
					communicate the issue to them calmly and with empathy.<br />Let’s put this into project Plant Pals
					context, where we’re troubleshooting an issue with broken planters.<br />Maybe when we were putting
					together our quality standards, we left some room for supplier error and accounted for some broken
					planters.<br />We’ll say, we figured an acceptable number of broken planters was 2 out of every
					50.<br />But let’s imagine that the customer received a shipment and there were five broken
					planters.<br />At that point, we’ll need to meet with the customer and ask important negotiation
					questions.<br />We’ll need to decide if the five broken planters out of every 50 is an acceptable
					outcome, or we’ll need to discuss whether the customer would consider investing in a higher tier of
					planters that may be less prone to breaking.<br />Presenting a solution like using sturdier planters
					will affect their budget and they’ll need to adjust accordingly.<br />Is the customer OK with that
					change?<br />Would that lead to another trade off?<br />Keeping in mind that the main goal here is
					customer satisfaction, throughout the negotiation process you’ll want to be considerate of their
					feelings and limitations.<br />You can do this by exhibiting empathy, understanding their
					frustrations,
					addressing them, and finding a solution that’s beneficial for both of you.<br />You may have held a
					customer facing role in the past, whether that’s in a call center, as a retail associate, as a
					server in
					a restaurant, or any number of positions.<br />Even if you haven’t, you’ve probably been an advocate
					for
					yourself while conversing with a customer service representative.<br />Because of this, you’ll
					probably
					have a good idea of what good customer service looks like.<br />Good customer service results in
					choosing to go back to the same hair salon, bakery, or coffee shop, because you like the way that
					you’re
					treated and the service you received, even if you had an issue, versus choosing not to go back to
					those
					places if you don’t receive that level of care.<br />Your past experiences have taught you to manage
					relationships and to avoid delivering something that’s low quality.<br />It doesn’t feel great when
					you’re on the receiving end.<br />In order to yield better results in future projects, it’s
					necessary to
					get feedback from customers.<br />Sometimes this feedback will come during the process, and
					sometimes,
					it will come after the project is completed, depending on how you map it out in the initiation
					phase.<br />The matter of when you receive feedback may come down to what you actually want to
					accomplish in your project.<br />If your business is launching an e-commerce site, you will want
					user
					feedback so you can make adjustments to optimize the customer’s shopping experience.<br />If your
					business is an on demand cookie delivery service, you may want to deliver the cookies and then get
					their
					user feedback to know how your customers felt about the cookies and the delivery experience as a
					whole.<br />User feedback helps to close any gaps in understanding between the customer’s
					expectation
					and the project’s needs.<br />So to summarize very briefly, soft skills like negotiation, empathetic
					listening, and trust building will help create a good relationship between you and your
					customers.<br />And getting feedback from those customers will help you to iterate on a product or
					service.<br />As promised, we’re going to discuss user testing and feedback.<br />If the end goal of
					our
					project is to have a great quality product or service for both our own organization and our
					customer, we
					need to get an idea of what the customer wants.<br />We already learned how to make sure something
					is
					high quality on our end.<br />Now let’s find out how to measure what clients want, so we can meet
					their
					needs expectations and standards.<br />The best way to get an idea of what customers and users want
					is
					to ask them.<br />But we don’t mean calling each of them up on the phone and literally asking
					them.<br />That might not be the best use of our time.<br />Fortunately, there are a few ways we can
					streamline that information.<br />We can conduct a series of surveys or tests with customers and
					users.<br />Some common ones are feedback surveys and user acceptance tests.<br />Let’s start with
					feedback surveys.<br />Feedback surveys are a survey in which users provide feedback on features of
					your
					product that they like or dislike.<br />These surveys can take place as you design, before you
					launch,
					in order to find out if people like and understand the product, or after you’ve launched, if you
					want to
					make sure the user experience is even more satisfying.<br />So your users participate in a survey
					and
					give you feedback on what features they like or dislike, and potentially, which aspects they find to
					be
					fairly intuitive and which aspects are a little tougher to navigate.<br />After you get that
					feedback,
					you’ll either be good to launch if you haven’t yet, or you’ll go back and iterate on the product if
					it’s
					already on the market.<br />Alternatively, you might conduct user acceptance tests.<br />In broader
					terms, a user acceptance test, or a UAT, is a test that helps a business make sure that a product or
					solution works for its users.<br />A UAT must meet the agreed upon requirements and deliver the
					expected
					results.<br />This test is typically used to assess the end to end experience for the user of a new
					process or product.<br />A user acceptance test is incredibly important because it takes place near
					the
					end of a product’s development, and therefore, is an overall user experience test of the entire
					product,
					software, or service.<br />UATs are sometimes referred to as beta tests.<br />Let’s find out what a
					user
					acceptance test agenda might look like.<br />In a typical UAT setting, you’ll welcome your users and
					thank them for participating.<br />Then, you’ll present the product to them.<br />This includes
					discussing testing guidelines and demonstrating how the product works.<br />Next, you’ll start your
					UAT
					test cases, taking your audience through critical user journeys.<br />A critical user journey is the
					sequence of steps a user follows to accomplish tasks in your product.<br />When presenting something
					you’ve built, you must give users a visual representation or mockup of your product, or have them go
					through a demo.<br />For example, if you’re working on a construction based project, and you intend
					to
					replace all appliances and hardware in the home, you’ll want to give the user some sort of vision of
					what that might entail.<br />This could include 3D models, digital blueprints, samples, and
					more.<br />Your UAT demo should focus on a call to action.<br />For instance, the call to action for
					your project may be the need to test hardware in the client’s future home.<br />Maybe the homeowners
					have requested a dishwasher that can be opened and closed with very little force and doesn’t make
					too
					much noise.<br />In that case, you’ll want to give the client real life scenarios to work
					within.<br />Ask them to load the dishes and start the wash cycle.<br />Then, ask questions like, on
					a
					scale of 1 to 10, how much force was required to open and close the dishwasher, to determine if the
					washer meets their expectations.<br />During your presentation and walk through of the UAT, you
					should
					be collecting feedback from the users on their overall experience.<br />During this part of testing,
					your users will be able to help you identify edge cases.<br />Edge cases are rare outliers that the
					original requirements didn’t account for.<br />They deal with the extreme maximums and minimums of
					parameters.<br />For example, imagine that you created an app that allows for unlimited photo
					uploads,
					knowing that users will rarely upload more than 1,000 photos in a single session.<br />How will the
					system deal with someone who actually does upload thousands of photos or millions in a single
					upload?<br />It’s unlikely, but it could be disastrous for your software.<br />After identifying
					edge
					cases, the last step of the UAT agenda is to recap your findings, identify bugs or issues, and
					prioritize which issues need to be addressed first.<br />When you’ve addressed the issue, and
					determined
					next steps, you’ll be able to close and conclude your user acceptance testing.<br />And there you
					have
					it.<br />So we’ve learned a bit more about the importance of listening to feedback from customers
					and
					discussed some common methods for measuring customer satisfaction like feedback surveys, user
					acceptance
					tests, and edge cases.<br />That’s a lot to learn.<br />Keep it up.<br />You’re doing great so
					far.<br />HOLLY: Hello again.<br />I’m Holly.<br />If you’ve been following this program from start
					to
					finish, you may remember me from an earlier course, where I shared a bit about accessibility and why
					it’s so important to keep it in mind as a project manager.<br />So far, you’ve learned the
					importance of
					managing, communicating, and measuring quality.<br />This is a great opportunity to also think about
					how
					to ensure the ways you are collecting feedback and the processes in place to measure quality are
					fair
					and accessible.<br />First, if you are collecting feedback through live interviews, be sure to
					include
					an offer to provide accommodations in your correspondence when setting up the sessions.<br />You may
					get
					requests for live captioning or an interpreter.<br />Other folks, such as those with anxiety or on
					the
					autism spectrum, may ask to see the questions in advance, so that they have time to think about and
					prepare their answers.<br />Remember, what works for one person may not work for another person,
					even if
					those two people have the same disability.<br />If you’re conducting an interview on location,
					examine
					the space with an accessibility lens, like ensuring there’s an accessible path into the building and
					to
					the room, and that hallways are clear of clutter that could block someone using a wheelchair or a
					walker, or someone with a visual impairment from easily and safely moving through.<br />If sending a
					survey or collecting feedback using technology, check that the systems you are using are fully
					accessible.<br />If you’re unsure, contact the system owner and ask if they are compliant with the
					latest Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, or WCAG.<br />Be prepared to provide questions and
					collect
					responses in an alternate manner if needed.<br />Beyond collecting feedback, as a project manager,
					it’s
					important for you to make accessibility part of the conversation from the beginning, especially if
					your
					project pertains to a process or product.<br />Oftentimes, incorporating accessible features into a
					product is overlooked or left to the final stages of a project and can lead to serious implications
					like
					launch delays, or worse, a product that can’t be used by a percentage of the population.<br />Ensure
					your developers are familiar with accessibility requirements at the start.<br />If they’re not, help
					connect them with appropriate resources or experts.<br />Include testers with various disabilities
					in
					your usability testing whenever possible.<br />And at the very least, have the product tested for
					adherence to Accessibility Guidelines.<br />In summary, think about accessibility early and often,
					and
					encourage others on your project team to do so, too.<br />Coming up, you’ll practice ways to measure
					quality and learn more about managing changes, risk, and so much more.<br />Keep up the great
					work.<br />SPEAKER: In this video, we’ll explore how to advocate for and create continuous
					improvements
					in a project by learning about process improvements.<br />Continuous improvement is an ongoing
					effort to
					improve products or services.<br />It helps ensure that a product steadily makes its way toward the
					best
					possible outcome.<br />Continuous improvement begins with recognizing when processes and tasks need
					to
					be created, eliminated, or improved.<br />Then a project manager must plan for and implement changes
					to
					keep the project on track.<br />That’s where process improvement comes from.<br />Process
					improvement is
					the practice of identifying, analyzing, and improving existing processes to enhance the performance
					of
					your team and to develop best practices, or to optimize consumer experiences.<br />When working
					through
					process improvements, using a controlled environment in an experiment can help you understand if the
					changes you’re considering fix your problem.<br />A control is an experiment or observation designed
					to
					minimize the effects of variables.<br />Control groups are representative samples that help you to
					determine that the differences between your experimental groups and the norm are due to your
					changes,
					rather than something else.<br />They eliminate alternative explanations for your results.<br />If
					you
					aren’t familiar with this, that’s OK because I’ll break it down for you.<br />For example, you
					observe a
					problem with your process and put forward a hypothesis, which is an educated guess about what’s
					causing
					the problem and how you’d fix it.<br />Then you change one variable in the system, keeping the
					control
					group the same, and observe your results again.<br />Let’s put this in the context of project Plant
					Pal
					scenario.<br />Business is booming for Office Green, and demand for your team’s new plant service is
					rapidly growing.<br />To meet the demand, suppliers have streamlined their process of packing boxes
					and
					putting all plants into a one size fits all box.<br />Let’s say, you’re using just one box size to
					ship
					all of your plants.<br />For smaller plants, there’s more padding added to the box to fill the extra
					space.<br />And the plants usually arrive intact.<br />But larger plants have to be squeezed into
					the
					boxes and sometimes arrive damaged, according to customer surveys.<br />To fix this problem, you
					hypothesize a potential solution by posing a question.<br />Would more of the large plants arrive
					intact
					if they were shipped in bigger boxes, using the same padding we use for the small
					plants?<br />Here’s
					where your control comes in.<br />You continue to ship half of the larger plants in the original
					boxes.<br />This is your control group.<br />And you experiment by shipping the other half in bigger
					boxes.<br />Nothing else is different about the boxes except the size.<br />The shape, thickness,
					supplier, delivery addresses, absolutely everything else stays exactly the same.<br />After the
					larger
					plants are delivered, you conduct a new survey.<br />If more larger plants arrived intact, your
					hypothesis is confirmed.<br />If the results are the same as they were before the experiment, you’ll
					need to try something else to solve the problem of your damaged plants.<br />Working in a controlled
					environment isn’t the only way to ensure continuous improvements.<br />There are various data driven
					improvement frameworks, like DMAIC and PDCA.<br />I’ll define those and present them in the context
					of
					Plant Pals in the next video.<br />See you there.<br />In the last video, I introduced the concept
					of
					continuous improvements.<br />We explored in depth how working in a controlled environment can
					optimize
					your outcomes.<br />In this video, we’re going to keep on that same path of uncovering methods for
					continuous improvements.<br />We’ll start with data-driven improvement frameworks.<br />Data-driven
					improvement frameworks are techniques used to make decisions based on actual data.<br />The first
					data-driven improvement framework we’ll cover may be familiar to you, since we discussed it in a
					previous course.<br />Recall that DMAIC, or DMAIC, stands for define, measure, analyze, improve, and
					control.<br />And it maps out to five steps that you can take when working toward continuous
					improvements.<br />So when considering how you can improve customer experiences, start with the
					following.<br />First you’ll need to define the business problem, goals, resources, project scope,
					and
					project timeline.<br />Next, measure.<br />Here, you’ll conduct performance metrics and data
					collection
					to establish baselines and measure success.<br />Then, analyze.<br />Work to find the root causes of
					problems and understand their impact.<br />Next, improve.<br />This means implementing a reasonable
					solution to the problem.<br />Lastly, control.<br />This is where you’ll implement the changes and
					stay
					on top of monitoring the updated processes you’ve established.<br />Another framework you can refer
					to
					when working through continuous improvements is PDCA.<br />PDCA is a four-step process that focuses
					on
					identifying a problem, fixing that issue, assessing whether the fix was successful, and fine tuning
					the
					final fix.<br />The steps are as follows.<br />First, plan.<br />Here, you’ll identify the issue and
					root cause and brainstorm solutions to the problem.<br />Let’s say that one type of plant isn’t
					selling
					well, which means the warehouse is full of a particular species.<br />If you don’t do something
					fast,
					the plants may die soon.<br />So, what are some viable solutions?<br />You propose moving the items
					from
					the bottom of the sales page on the website to the top.<br />So those plants are front and
					center.<br />You could also send out email marketing campaigns featuring that plant, where you offer
					customers a buy one, get one offer on the plant.<br />Second, do, or fix the problem.<br />In this
					case,
					your sponsor decided that they didn’t feel comfortable giving plants away if they could still
					profit.<br />So you’ve decided to go with the first option, moving the plant to a more prominent
					part of
					the website.<br />Your hypothesis is that the best way to shift older inventory is to put it in a
					place
					that customers can’t miss.<br />The next part of this framework is check.<br />Compare your results
					to
					the goal to find out if the problem is fixed.<br />Now you wait one week and notice if the sales
					numbers
					go up for that plant.<br />If they did, your hypothesis is correct.<br />And you’ve saved some plant
					lives and helped Office Green avoid financial loss.<br />Nice job.<br />And finally, act or fine
					tune
					the fix to ensure continuous improvement.<br />In our example, you decide to reorganize the
					website.<br />In the future, all overstocked plans will get a prominent place on the
					website.<br />Both
					PDCA and DMAIC are great problem solving frameworks to apply in your day to day life and in the
					workplace.<br />These frameworks help you to identify issues, reduce errors, and optimize your
					processes.<br />I encourage you to think about these techniques next time you encounter a problem or
					notice room for improvement within a workflow.<br />You’ll be surprised at how a simple framework
					can
					help set you up for success.<br />Awesome.<br />Now you know more about advocating for and creating
					continuous improvements.<br />We also defined and went through some examples of using frameworks,
					DMAIC
					and PDCA, for process improvements.<br />Now that you know the basics of continuous improvement and
					process improvement, we’ll discuss the differences between projects and programs and how they
					intersect.<br />I’ll meet you in the next video.<br />By now, you know that a project manager
					interacts
					with their team members on a daily basis.<br />What you may not know is that project managers are
					also
					part of a bigger ecosystem within their business or organization.<br />Projects are not the only
					endeavor a project manager may participate in.<br />There are also programs and portfolios.<br />A
					project is one single focused endeavor.<br />A program is a collection of projects.<br />And a
					portfolio
					is a collection of projects and programs across the whole organization.<br />Think of it this way,
					projects can exist inside of programs, which can exist inside of portfolios.<br />Note that I said
					can,
					because this won’t always be the case.<br />Projects can also exist as separate unrelated
					initiatives.<br />But if they’re a part of something bigger within the organization, projects can
					become
					a program.<br />The collective and separate successes of all of these three rely on continuous
					improvements.<br />So who are the people that manage these various endeavors and drive
					success?<br />Let’s think of this organizationally, starting with the project manager.<br />A
					project
					manager oversees individual projects and has short term concrete deliverables.<br />The project
					manager
					is tasked with continuously improving their assigned project.<br />A program manager supervises
					groups
					of projects, and even other project managers, and focuses on long term business
					objectives.<br />This
					program manager is tasked with continuously improving their assigned collection of projects.<br />A
					portfolio manager supervises a grouping of projects and programs and provides centralized management
					to
					them.<br />This portfolio manager is tasked with continuously improving their assigned collection of
					projects and programs.<br />Different companies may have slightly different names for these roles,
					but
					the concept is the same.<br />Let’s examine an instance where these rules directly create continuous
					improvement for their organizations.<br />A project manager has decided to offer monthly cross
					departmental trainings to members of their team.<br />Their team is small, so they figure it’s
					helpful
					when people from other departments understand their workload and processes.<br />This way, if
					someone is
					out of office, there will always be coverage.<br />After a couple of months of these trainings, the
					project manager realizes they not only improve processes in communication, but they act as
					inadvertent
					team builders.<br />Because of the trainings, employees have the opportunity to interact and to get
					to
					know one another better.<br />The project manager takes this info to their program manager.<br />And
					the
					program manager loves this unexpected insight.<br />Now, the program manager can establish these
					trainings across all of the projects that they’re managing, making these continuous improvements
					program
					wide, rather than just project wide.<br />So exactly what would projects, programs, and portfolios
					look
					like at Office Green?<br />Getting the Plant Pal service launched and running is a
					project.<br />It’s
					short term and temporary.<br />Once the service is launched successfully, the project
					ends.<br />Keeping
					the service going indefinitely requires the project to become a program.<br />The program, running
					the
					Plant Pal service, becomes one of Office Green’s long term business objectives.<br />And the company
					will work on continuously improving the program.<br />Now Plant Pals, along with other projects and
					programs at Office Green, are included in the company’s portfolio.<br />As continues improvements
					are
					executed in project Plant Pals, the program and portfolios at Office Green will notice the benefits
					of
					that.<br />For instance, let’s refer to the example of overstocked plants from the previous
					video.<br />While using PDCA– plan, do, check, act– you notice a drop in the sales of one of the
					plant
					varieties.<br />So you decide to reorganize the website so the species that isn’t selling is
					featured at
					the top, giving a small discount.<br />This change is so successful that you end up making it a best
					practice.<br />From now on, low performing and overstocked plant varieties will be featured at the
					top
					of the website.<br />This is, in fact, a new process.<br />Running it over and over again will drive
					continuous improvements.<br />The continuous improvement you made to the project reflected well in
					your
					program and portfolio.<br />Because now that that’s been tested, the same strategy can be
					implemented
					company for all of the company’s other sites and products, reducing waste and increasing revenue
					across
					the board.<br />If many or all of the projects at Office Green see the same improvement, that
					directly
					benefits the program, which is the collective of the projects.<br />If the same strategy is applied
					to
					programs at Office Green, the portfolio will directly benefit by having stronger indicators for
					profitability.<br />Great.<br />So now we’ve learned how to define a program and how it differs from
					a
					project.<br />We also discussed the impact of a project that could result in a program.<br />And we
					learned how a project can turn into programs or portfolios.<br />Have you ever looked back on an
					event
					in your life and wished it went differently?<br />Well, we can’t help you go back in time, but there
					are
					things you can do to ensure you don’t experience the same missteps again.<br />In the last video, we
					discussed continuous improvements.<br />One way to ensure continuous improvements is to conduct a
					retrospective.<br />So let’s discuss that a little more in depth.<br />A retrospective is a workshop
					or
					meeting that gives project teams time to reflect on a project.<br />Retrospectives, sometimes known
					as
					retros, should happen throughout the lifecycle of a project, but mostly are implemented after major
					milestones, or most commonly, after a project is completed.<br />Retrospectives give you a chance to
					discuss successes and setbacks that took place within the project or phases.<br />You can think of
					them
					as a form of process improvement within your project.<br />Retrospectives serve three main
					purposes.<br />First, they encourage team building because they allow team members to understand
					differing perspectives within their team.<br />Second, they facilitate improved collaboration on
					future
					projects.<br />And third, they promote positive changes in future procedures and
					processes.<br />Let’s
					detail each one.<br />Retrospectives are great for team building since they enable teams to
					understand
					each other better and facilitate better collaboration, which improves productivity.<br />The
					emphasis in
					retrospective is on continuous improvement and change, instead of recycling old and potentially bad
					habits, procedures, and processes.<br />Retrospectives are helpful because even if we plan for every
					possible risk, odds are that something will sneak up on us.<br />When something does fall through
					the
					cracks and you need to reflect on it with the team, may want to conduct a retrospective.<br />Some
					additional reasons that you might want to conduct a retrospective include missed deadlines or
					expectations, or miscommunications between stakeholders.<br />You may also want to hold a
					retrospective
					at the end of a sprint.<br />As a reminder, a sprint is a series of ordered tasks, ending in a
					goal.<br />You could also hold a retrospective after product launches and landings.<br />These are
					all
					great opportunities to record key lessons that other people might learn from as they work on their
					own
					projects.<br />Identifying the stumbling blocks and successes in a project helps improve future
					processes.<br />But the way you decide to conduct a retrospective can vary.<br />There’s no exact
					formula or template for a productive retrospective.<br />The way you choose to structure your
					retrospective will depend on your team and workplace.<br />You may decide to conduct a formal, in
					person
					retrospective if your team prefers to debrief in that setting.<br />You can incorporate sticky
					notes,
					documents, or any other kind of physical tools to help your team debrief.<br />Or if you find that
					your
					team often gets off track during in-person meetings, you may decide a virtual or online
					retrospective is
					a better option.<br />In this case, surveys might help to get thoughts organized.<br />Although
					there’s
					no one way to conduct retrospectives, there are certain best practices to keep in mind.<br />As we
					previously mentioned, you’ll want your retrospectives to be blameless.<br />Making sure that
					everyone
					feels comfortable giving feedback as candidly as possible will result in the most productive
					retrospective.<br />To navigate through awkward situations or sensitive subjects, it may be
					necessary to
					encourage anonymous or private feedback.<br />A couple of tactics a project manager can use to
					ensure
					the process remains blameless are changing perspective and switching from “you” language to “we”
					language.<br />Changing perspective means putting yourself in someone else’s shoes.<br />If your
					team is
					quick to blame the delivery company for their plants not arriving at the customer’s office on time,
					think about the situation from the delivery company’s perspective.<br />Was the delivery company’s
					route
					optimized and tested to avoid traffic?<br />If not, maybe that should have been a task in your
					project.<br />Using “you” language can get you in trouble because it can feel like everyone in the
					room
					is judging the person receiving the blame.<br />For example, telling your project sponsor that you
					didn’t make it clear that we didn’t have money for a contingency budget when plants die is not as
					productive as saying, the lack of a contingency budget wasn’t made fully clear from the get
					go.<br />And
					that’s something we can improve upon for next time.<br />The project sponsor may feel attacked and
					wonder why you, the project manager, didn’t ask the right questions in the early stages.<br />Maybe
					the
					fact of the matter is that both of you could have done a little bit more to include a contingency
					budget.<br />And that’s OK.<br />Make sure you aren’t only focusing on the
					negative.<br />Retrospectives
					are about reflecting on the positive aspects of projects, too.<br />So talk about what went well,
					what
					was fun, what new things will you be able to carry with you into future projects.<br />Maybe the
					sales
					and marketing teams don’t work together often, but this gave them an opportunity to bond.<br />Maybe
					you
					enjoyed working with the project Plant Pals contracted website designer so much that the team has
					decided to hire them full time.<br />Whatever the positives were, they’re worth
					celebrating.<br />You
					could even order some dinner or dessert as a thank you to everyone.<br />Finally, you want to make
					sure
					that you enact the changes you’ve discussed.<br />You’ll put the discussed changes in place and
					decide
					to handle the project a little differently in the next phase.<br />Remember how I said there wasn’t
					one
					exact formula or template to follow when conducting retrospectives?<br />That’s because every team
					learns, adapts, and grows differently.<br />In this video, we’ll talk about how to conduct a
					retrospective.<br />Different situations call for different tactics.<br />And when it comes to
					receiving
					potentially sensitive feedback, it’s best to consider your team’s needs.<br />There are a couple of
					things to keep in mind before you begin a retrospective.<br />First, you’ll want to maintain a
					positive
					tone throughout the process.<br />Remember, even if there are some tough conversations, the
					objective of
					a retrospective is to encourage improvements, which prepare you for future projects.<br />In
					general,
					the retrospective should be considered a positive experience, where team members feel comfortable
					sharing their feedback.<br />Next, you may need to be considerate of teams outside of your
					own.<br />If
					there are other teams you partner with regularly, they’ll need to be involved in the retrospective
					as
					well.<br />For instance, some adjacent teams that were part of the project may feel like they want
					to
					voice an opinion about the struggle to maintain communication between teams.<br />If they choose not
					to
					be involved in the retrospective, you’ll at least want to share your findings with them.<br />After
					all,
					smoothing cross team interactions and deliverable handoffs is a frequent topic of discussion in
					retrospectives.<br />As previously mentioned, you can use various props and tools to conduct your
					retrospective.<br />Here’s an example of what a retrospective might entail.<br />As you’ll notice,
					it’s
					pretty extensive and includes a lot of opportunity for details.<br />You’ll want to encourage as
					much
					feedback as possible from your team.<br />This retrospective template is a standard document with
					room
					for project managers to fill out and discuss with their teams and use it to guide the
					conversations.<br />Go over the chain of events in the same way that they happened in real
					time.<br />What happened during the planning stage?<br />What could have gone better?<br />Where did
					your team get lucky?<br />How about during the execution stage?<br />As you do that, fill out the
					lessons learned section, which is a space for you to elaborate on things you could do differently
					the
					next time around.<br />This is a space to include which risks materialized during your
					project.<br />Was
					there a large gap between the original plan and its execution?<br />How did the team feel about
					it?<br />Maybe several of your project team members commented on the fact that the website launch
					didn’t
					meet the original deadline.<br />Because of this, sales team members didn’t hit their numbers that
					month.<br />The marketing department had to change the date on several pieces of content and
					ads.<br />And the sponsor had to answer to investors who were eager to view the website.<br />Team
					members are upset now because if you had prioritized the website’s completion and spent less time on
					less important tasks, this may have been avoided.<br />It’s difficult feedback, but it’s pertinent
					for
					future successes to consider why this risk materialized.<br />Next time, you’ll make sure to
					prioritize
					a task with so many dependencies.<br />Now that you’ve gone over how everything went, build a better
					future for your team by filling out the remaining tables.<br />The first one is action
					items.<br />And
					we’ll address the question, what actions should we take as a result of our lessons
					learned?<br />You’ll
					start on the left hand side with the action item you want to address.<br />Then make your way
					through
					the cells to the right as you include information like type, as in, is this a tool, a process a
					team, or
					something else?<br />Owner– who will own this action item.<br />And relative, links– consider where
					we’re tracking this item.<br />The next table is all about future considerations.<br />Are there any
					risks that could become issues if not addressed in the next quarter?<br />Do you need to pass off
					ownership of this project to someone else?<br />Include those, and make sure to fill out the other
					cells, including type.<br />Is this a process, a team, or something else?<br />Contact– who can be
					our
					resource on this procedure if we need to reference it later?<br />And again, any links that may seem
					relevant to this topic.<br />That could be relevant documentation if you’re passing the project off
					or
					maybe a risk register from your project.<br />And there you have it.<br />Now I showed you a pretty
					standard retrospective, as you’d fill it out.<br />But if you feel like your team needs something a
					little more interactive, feel free to have fun with it.<br />The way you gather this information
					from
					your team can be more innovative than just the lists.<br />You can use color coding, sticky notes,
					columns with emojis, and anything else you feel will suit your team and keep them
					engaged.<br />Whatever
					you do, make sure you carry the lessons learned into your next projects.<br />ROWENA:
