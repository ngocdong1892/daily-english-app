					respect.<br />What qualities do they have that make them a good leader?<br />Maybe they’re an active
					listener.<br />Maybe they’re great at fostering a sense of community for people around them.<br />As
					a
					project manager, leadership is a big part of the job.<br />But being a great project manager is
					about
					more than simply leading a team to complete a project.<br />It’s about supporting the people on your
					team to do their best work and enabling people to build things they’re proud of.<br />In this video,
					we’ll define teamwork and explain why it’s important for successful project management.<br />The
					best
					leaders are able to get people to work together.<br />That’s why a project manager’s ability to
					develop
					and lead teams that work well together is so important.<br />But before we go further, let’s pause
					and
					consider what exactly is a team?<br />Though there are many different definitions of the word team,
					here’s how we describe it here at Google.<br />A team is a group of people who plan, solve problems,
					make decisions, and review progress in service of a specific project or objective.<br />Team members
					rely on each other to get things done.<br />For example, a software engineering team might be tasked
					with creating one seamless software experience that meets users’ needs.<br />Beyond coordinating
					with
					the project manager, members of the software engineering team will also coordinate with one another
					as
					they work toward their shared goal.<br />Teams differ from work groups, which we define as being
					based
					on organizational or managerial hierarchy.<br />Though people within a workgroup might be working
					toward
					a common goal, their work is more likely to be coordinated, controlled, or assigned by a single
					person
					or entity.<br />For example, a workgroup focused on quality assurance testing might be tasked with
					running a set of test plans.<br />The group manager might split up that work and assign each quality
					assurance tester a plan to review.<br />But unlike a team, the testers will work independently of
					one
					another to complete their tasks and will coordinate mainly with the manager and the development team
					of
					the feature they’re testing.<br />Teams and work groups each have unique benefits within a larger
					organization.<br />But for the purpose of this program, we’ll focus on teams.<br />More
					specifically,
					we’ll discuss how project managers develop and lead effective teams by fostering a culture of
					teamwork.<br />Teamwork is an effective collaborative way of working in which each person is
					committed
					to and heading toward a shared goal.<br />Teamwork maximizes the individual strength of each team
					member
					to bring out the best in each person.<br />As you might imagine, teamwork is a crucial part of
					successful project management.<br />There are a few reasons for this.<br />For one, teamwork fosters
					creativity.<br />A team might leverage the diverse perspectives, skills, and experiences of their
					members to devise better solutions and build products that address more diverse user needs than they
					might have if they were working independently of each other.<br />Teamwork also encourages
					accountability.<br />The knowledge that the execution of your tasks directly impacts the tasks of
					the
					rest of the team can be a powerful motivator.<br />And most importantly, teamwork helps you get
					stuff
					done.<br />Big complex projects need smart, capable people to complete task and to reach milestones
					to
					meet the project goals.<br />As the project manager, it’s your job to encourage others to actively
					engage in working together as a team to foster creativity, encourage accountability, and to get
					stuff
					done.<br />Teamwork is an effective collaborative way of working.<br />And when done right, it can
					positively impact both measurable team results and the team culture.<br />Coming up will take you
					through the elements of effective teams.<br />Meet you there.<br />[MUSIC PLAYING] Teams are made up
					of
					individuals.<br />And individuals are driven by different motivators, whether that’s serving their
					organization, supporting their family, or simply working on projects they think are
					cool.<br />You’ll
					need to learn about the people on your team in order to best determine how to motivate everyone at
					the
					same time.<br />A few years ago, researchers here at Google set out to identify the dynamics of
					effective teams.<br />And through this research, they identified five factors that have an impact on
					team effectiveness.<br />In order of importance, those five factors are psychological safety,
					dependability, structure and clarity, meaning, and impact.<br />Let’s break these down.<br />Let’s
					start
					with psychological safety, which is the number one factor that impacts team
					effectiveness.<br />Here’s
					how our researchers define it.<br />Psychological safety refers to an individual’s perception of the
					consequences of taking an interpersonal risk.<br />In other words, they believe it’s safe to take
					risks
					within their team, and they don’t risk being labeled as ignorant, incompetent, negative, or
					disruptive.<br />On teams with high psychological safety, teammates feel comfortable taking risks
					around
					fellow team members, seeking differing opinions, and resolving interpersonal conflict when it comes
					up.<br />For example, on my team at Google, we like to say, be direct and kind.<br />We’ve worked
					really
					hard to build a team culture in which we can hold one another accountable while maintaining a shared
					space that is safe, secure, and peaceful.<br />What I’ve found is that when opportunities to take
					risks
					do arise like pitching an out-of-the-box idea to my directors, for example, this culture of mutual
					respect has already laid the groundwork to get direct feedback without frustration or worrying that
					I
					might embarrass myself.<br />And that’s been invaluable in maintaining a high level of psychological
					safety for the team.<br />Next, we have dependability.<br />Google’s researchers explain it this
					way.<br />On dependable teams, members are reliable and complete their work on time.<br />Creating a
					dependable team requires a combination of setting, negotiating, and meeting expectations.<br />Yes,
					your
					team needs to meet the expectations set for them.<br />At the same time, you as the project manager
					need
					to establish a two-way relationship with your team.<br />You have to be able to clearly communicate
					expectations and ensure that the team feels comfortable negotiating with you when needed.<br />For
					example, it’s likely that a person on your team works on two or more projects with competing
					deadlines.<br />If they’re afraid to share their own constraints with you, then their work on both
					projects might suffer.<br />Alternatively, if they come to you with their concerns, an open
					understanding and negotiation around priorities could help ease their burden.<br />Next, we have
					structure and clarity.<br />Here’s how our researchers define it.<br />Structure and clarity refers
					to
					an individual’s understanding of job expectations, knowledge of how to meet those expectations, and
					the
					consequences of their performance.<br />Each team member has a clear sense of their individual role,
					plans, and goals.<br />And they have a sense of how their work affects the group.<br />You as the
					project manager can help foster a sense of structure and clarity on the team.<br />For example, if a
					project structure and tracking are sloppy, unorganized, and incohesive, then the team’s output is
					likely
					to be sloppy, unorganized, and incohesive.<br />This can cause tension within the
					team.<br />Alternatively, if you diligently engage in project tracking, your team will have clarity,
					feel more united, and will be able to effectively collaborate.<br />Meaning also impacts team
					effectiveness.<br />Google’s researchers define meaning in this context as finding a sense of
					purpose
					either in the work itself or in the results of that work.<br />For example, your teammates might
					find
					meaning in supporting themselves financially, helping the team reach its goals, or wanting their
					products to reach a new community of users.<br />And, finally, we have impact.<br />Our researchers
					define impact as the belief that the results of one’s work matters and creates change, it can be
					challenging for people to notice how their work can shift an entire ecosystem forward.<br />Part of
					your
					role as the project manager is to help individual teammates identify how they drive impact, both
					within
					the team and beyond it.<br />Project tracking can be a helpful tool for visualizing progress and
					impact.<br />Meeting milestones, for example, demonstrates to the team how their individual tasks
					contribute to the larger project goals.<br />For example, my team focuses on routing within Google
					Maps.<br />The big idea is to focus on helping people to get to where they’re going on time.<br />So
					everything we do should make that experience incrementally better.<br />And that’s how we add
					impact.<br />To recap, Google’s researchers identified psychological safety, dependability,
					structure
					and clarity, meaning, and impact as the top five factors that have an impact on team
					effectiveness.<br />Coming up, we’ll discuss how project managers lead teams that reach project
					goals.<br />[MUSIC PLAYING] There are a few key ways that project managers help build
					high-functioning
					teams who work together to meet project goals.<br />They create systems that turn chaos into
					order.<br />They communicate and listen.<br />They promote trust and psychological safety.<br />They
					demonstrate empathy and create motivation.<br />They delegate responsibility and
					prioritize.<br />And
					they celebrate team success.<br />Let’s go through each of those points one by one.<br />Good
					project
					managers lead their teams by creating systems that turn chaos into order.<br />You can do this by
					creating, implementing, and improving standardized, measurable, repeatable, and scalable workflows
					and
					processes for your team.<br />For example, if you find that you’re usually chasing down teammates
					for
					progress on their work, you might set up a process for how and when a teammate should let you know
					that
					they’ve completed a task.<br />Think of creating systems as a kind of connect the dots
					puzzle.<br />Being a project manager is sort of that.<br />But there are no numbers, just dots and a
					partial image.<br />But we don’t need the numbers.<br />We can notice the dots, know their
					importance,
					and string them together to help everyone visualize the project as a whole.<br />You find the system
					through the chaos and help other people to find it too.<br />Another way that project managers lead
					is
					through communicating and listening.<br />As the project manager, it’s your job to ensure that
					everyone
					on your team is on the same page regarding the status of your project.<br />For example, you might
					communicate with the team via daily or weekly status update emails and regular team
					meetings.<br />Team
					meetings also provide a space for listening, whether you’re gathering feedback on a workflow or
					process
					or fielding questions from the group.<br />You can also solicit feedback or questions via status
					update
					emails since some people might feel more comfortable speaking in private.<br />In addition to
					communicating and listening to the wider team, it’s also your responsibility to regularly connect
					with
					individual teammates.<br />You do this by gaining an understanding of communication styles and by
					asking
					people on your team how they prefer to communicate.<br />What’s important to know is that everyone
					communicates differently.<br />For example, I might make small talk with colleagues who I know enjoy
					it.<br />Or I might get straight to the point with colleagues who prefer not to chat.<br />Project
					managers also lead by promoting trust and psychological safety within their team.<br />As a
					reminder,
					psychological safety refers to an individual’s perception of the consequences of taking an
					interpersonal
					risk.<br />Team members need to trust that they’re safe and speaking up if they have feedback or
					concerns about the project as a whole or about their individual tasks.<br />It’s your job to create
					a
					team atmosphere where different opinions are welcome and all members remain respectful of one
					another
					during challenging conversations.<br />For example, during weekly status meetings, you might
					schedule
					time for open, thoughtful, and inclusive discussions.<br />You might model this by asking for help
					solving a problem that’s impacting the team.<br />You should encourage contributions from all team
					members regardless of role or rank.<br />By doing this, you make clear to your teammates that they
					should feel comfortable challenging processes and workflows.<br />And you make clear that critiques
					of
					the project and plans are welcome and valued no matter who they come from.<br />While it can feel
					challenging to provide and accept feedback, it’s a healthy part of project management and usually
					makes
					for a better project outcome.<br />On an individual level, project managers lead by practicing
					empathy
					and creating motivation for their team members.<br />It’s possible you’ve heard the phrase there’s
					no I
					in team.<br />And while that’s true that teams need to work together to be effective, it’s also
					important to remember that teams are made up of individuals with differing motivations and lives
					outside
					of work.<br />You can demonstrate empathy for your teammates by being present, listening, and asking
					questions.<br />During one-on-one conversations, avoid making assumptions about what the other
					person is
					thinking and feeling.<br />If you’re quiet and curious, there’s always more to learn.<br />In
					addition
					to showing empathy for my team, I also like to create motivation by recognizing a job well done
					through
					public forums like in a meeting or a group email.<br />Recognition tells people that they’re doing
					the
					right things and motivates them to keep up the good work.<br />Be sure to recognize good work and
					not
					just heroic efforts.<br />Project managers also lead by delegating responsibility and
					prioritizing.<br />Most projects will likely have multiple tasks taking place
					simultaneously.<br />And
					it’s your job to keep the team focused and heading toward the project goals and
					deliverables.<br />By
					delegating responsibility for specific tasks to individuals on your team, you provide your teammates
					with the opportunity to add value using their particular set of skills.<br />You also give yourself
					space to focus on the project as a whole.<br />By prioritizing tasks, you reduce ambiguity and
					provide
					clarity for your team.<br />If you think that a task is important but your team doesn’t, they might
					work
					on whatever tasks they like.<br />By prioritizing and making that prioritization known, you keep the
					team focused.<br />Work with your team, to build consensus around priorities.<br />Explaining your
					rationale can help you get their buy-in and increase their commitment to the work.<br />Lastly,
					project
					managers lead by celebrating team success, both at the end of the project and throughout
					it.<br />This
					includes celebrating big and small wins like reaching a milestone or receiving positive feedback
					from
					stakeholders.<br />Celebrating success is an important tool for motivating the team because it
					increases
					morale and boosts the team’s engagement.<br />You might celebrate the team with a group lunch, a
					small
					gift, or even just a congratulatory email.<br />Simple gestures like these demonstrate appreciation
					for
					the team’s hard work.<br />And when people feel appreciated, they tend to work harder and their
					teams
					perform better.<br />To recap, project managers build high-functioning teams in a few key ways,
					creating
					systems that turn chaos into order, communicating and listening, promoting trust and psychological
					safety, demonstrating empathy and creating motivation, delegating responsibility and prioritizing,
					and
					celebrating team success.<br />As you grow in your career, you’ll strengthen your ability to lead
					bigger
					and more complex teams.<br />But the principles of teamwork will remain the same.<br />[MUSIC
					PLAYING]
					Imagine that you’re starting a new project with a brand new team of people.<br />No one on the team
					has
					worked together before.<br />So this will be a new experience for everyone.<br />To better
					understand
					how your team might develop over time, let’s discuss the psychologist Bruce Tuckman’s five stages of
					team development, forming, storming, norming, performing, and adjoining.<br />These stages of
					development illustrate how teams grow from a disparate group of people into a high-functioning
					unit.<br />You might even recognize the characteristics of each stage from previous experiences
					working
					on a team.<br />Tuckman’s first stage of team development is the forming stage.<br />At this point,
					everything feels shiny and new.<br />Individuals on the team are just getting to know one
					another.<br />And they’re eager to make a good impression.<br />And, typically, they’re excited for
					the
					work to begin.<br />During this stage, you as the project manager should clarify project goals,
					roles,
					and context about the project.<br />People are seeking guidance.<br />And it’s your job to provide
					that
					guidance.<br />The second stage of team development is the storming stage.<br />This is where things
					get
					a bit trickier.<br />As people settle into their roles and the work on the project begins, the
					people on
					your team are interacting more and maybe disagreeing a bit.<br />This is where feelings of
					frustration
					might emerge.<br />Individuals might take issues with certain processes they feel are inefficient or
					other teammates they disagree with, especially when the team is navigating tasks that are much more
					complex than they first appeared.<br />Make sense, right?<br />If you’re working closely with a new
					group of people for the first time, there’s bound to be some interpersonal conflict.<br />Teammates
					might disagree on time and effort estimations, vary in their levels of independence, or prefer to
					prioritize certain tasks over other equally important tasks.<br />As the project manager, it’s your
					job
					to focus on conflict resolution.<br />Listen as the team addresses problems to solve and share
					insights
					on how the team might better function as a unit.<br />After storming, comes Tuckman’s third stage,
					the
					norming stage.<br />At this point, the team has resolved some of its internal conflict by
					establishing
					new norms like processes and workflows that make it easier for everyone to get things done.<br />The
					team feels better equipped to work together efficiently and effectively.<br />You as the project
					manager
					should codify the team norms ensuring that the team is aware of those norms and reinforce them when
					needed.<br />For example, if you’ve agreed to discuss solutions to issues during weekly team
					meetings,
					ensure that your weekly agenda budgets time for this topic each week.<br />Tuckman’s fourth stage is
					the
					performing stage.<br />During this time, the team works together relatively seamlessly to complete
					tasks, reach milestones, and make progress toward the project goal.<br />In the performing stage,
					you as
					the project manager should focus on delegating, motivating, and providing feedback to keep up the
					team’s
					momentum.<br />The fifth and final stage of team development is the adjourning stage.<br />In this
					stage, the project is wrapping up and it’s time for the team to disband.<br />It can be a
					bittersweet
					time for the team.<br />And you might want to mark the end of the project with a
					celebration.<br />You
					as the project manager should set up time to celebrate the final milestones and success of the
					project
					as a group.<br />And be sure each member of your team knows what’s next for them.<br />To recap,
					Tuckman’s five stages of team development are forming, storming, norming, performing, and
					adjourning.<br />These stages of team development come together to form a helpful framework you can
					use
					to assess and recognize team dynamics and then adjust your management style accordingly.<br />Team
					dynamics refer to the forces, both conscious and unconscious, that impact team behavior and
					performance.<br />Managing team dynamics is a big part of determining how to motivate your
					team.<br />It
					might be tempting to assume that people can go full speed ahead into a project.<br />But in reality,
					it’s important to take time to understand the dynamics of your team overall and how individual team
					members are fitting in.<br />This is especially important during the more precarious forming and
					storming stages.<br />Let’s break down why managing team dynamics is so important.<br />First, teams
					have individuals with different skill sets, varying degrees of autonomy, and competing
					priorities.<br />It’s your job to forge consensus and set clear purposes, goals, dependencies, and
					accountability.<br />When teams function cohesively, they can focus on the tasks and objectives at
					hand.<br />Another reason why it’s important to manage team dynamics is that it helps you to create
					a
					collaborative and psychologically safe environment.<br />When team members feel safe, they’re
					willing to
					help one another and accept help when they need it.<br />This benefits the entire project by keeping
					schedules on track.<br />Though it can take time to get to the performing stage, using the norming
					stage
					as a time to foster a collaborative environment can help you get there quicker.<br />Understanding
					and
					managing team dynamics can also help you understand how to motivate your team.<br />Motivated team
					members are likely to contribute more to discussions, complete their tasks, and actively participate
					in
					other project activities.<br />A positive team atmosphere can help employees feel empowered, more
					comfortable taking calculated risks, and more likely to seek out innovative solutions to complex
					problems.<br />Remember, so much of team dynamics happens under the surface.<br />Identifying and
					understanding the stages of team development can help you make sense of how dynamics are playing out
					on
					your team.<br />[MUSIC PLAYING] Leading a project team comes with the responsibility to create a
					psychologically safe environment for the people around you.<br />Through ethical and inclusive
					leadership, you can create a team culture that works for everyone and motivates the people around
					you to
					do their best work.<br />In this video, you’ll learn the definitions of ethical and inclusive
					leadership.<br />You’ll also learn about the importance of fostering a culture of respect, creating
					equal opportunity to succeed, and ways to invite and integrate diverse perspectives.<br />So what do
					ethical and inclusive leadership entail in a team and organization?<br />Let’s start with ethical
					leadership.<br />Ethical leadership is a form of leadership that promotes and values honesty,
					justice,
					respect, community, and integrity.<br />You promote ethical leadership by defining and aligning
					values
					within your team and demonstrating how adhering to those values benefits the mission of the
					organization.<br />For an example of this, consider how work culture has evolved in recent
					years.<br />Around the world, employees working for organizations of all kinds have been calling on
					their employers to adopt ethical policy changes and to state their positions on current
					events.<br />Companies can demonstrate ethical leadership by creating forums where employees can
					raise
					their viewpoints to be heard and receive follow-up from company leaders on employee
					concerns.<br />Ethical leadership is closely tied to inclusive leadership.<br />If ethical
					leadership’s
					aim is to create forums where employees’ concerns can be heard, inclusive leadership aims to put
					what
					we’ve heard into action to create an environment that encourages and empowers each and every member
					of
					our community.<br />That in turn leads to more innovation and better solutions.<br />Here’s how we
					think
					about inclusion here at Google.<br />Inclusive leadership is when everyone’s unique identity,
					background, and experiences are respected, valued, and integrated into how the team
					operates.<br />These
					differences improve the team culture, collaboration, innovation, and output.<br />Inclusive
					leadership
					is related to diversity in that diversity is the set of differences each of us possesses, whether
					visible or invisible, that gives us each a unique perspective on the world and our
					work.<br />Inclusion
					is what the team does with that diversity of thought and perspective.<br />At Google, we’ve
					identified
					three ways that managers can lead inclusively.<br />These include fostering a culture of respect,
					creating equal opportunity to succeed, and inviting and integrating diverse perspectives.<br />To
					foster
					a culture of respect, it’s your job as a project manager to serve as a role model, set the tone for
					the
					team, and take action when needed.<br />That means modeling the values of your organization, taking
					appropriate action if misconduct occurs, creating an environment in which team members feel
					comfortable
					speaking up with concerns, and recognizing team contributions regularly.<br />To create equal
					opportunity to succeed, you should ensure that each person on the team has access to the information
					and
					resources they need to do their best work.<br />You do this through regular communication,
					accessible
					documentation, and regular check-ins with the team to listen, share information, ask and answer
					questions, and provide support.<br />As a project manager, you’re in the perfect spot to identify
					work
					that might be a good fit for a person who really wants it but who shies away from asking for
					it.<br />Knowing an individual’s aspirations will help you highlight these
					opportunities.<br />Finally,
					to invite and integrate diverse perspectives, it’s your role to cultivate a culture in which each
					team
					member’s perspective can be openly shared, heard, and integrated into work-related
					decisions.<br />You
					do this by creating a sense of psychological safety on the team and by inviting teammates to share
					their
					thoughts, ideas, and concerns regardless of their role or rank on the team.<br />Developing ethical
					and
					inclusive leadership skills requires regular practice.<br />So whether you’re leading a project team
					of
					two or 20 or 200, you should be diligent in building up your inclusive leadership skill set by
					creating
					an environment in which your team feels safe, heard, and valued.<br />You can do this by fostering a
					culture of respect, creating equal opportunity to succeed, and inviting and integrating diverse
					perspectives.<br />[MUSIC PLAYING] There are a few techniques that project managers can use to
					influence
					the people they work with, both within a team and beyond it.<br />But, first, what do we mean by
					influencing?<br />Influencing Is the ability to alter another person’s thinking or
					behaviors.<br />We’ll
					discuss the concept of influencing in the context of our Plant Pals project at Office
					Green.<br />Let’s
					say that your team would like to partner with a well known chocolate manufacturer to create a bundle
					deal.<br />With this deal, the client could choose to add on a high-quality chocolate bar with each
					plant they purchase.<br />You decide to send an initial email to a partnership manager at the
					chocolate
					manufacturer to gauge their interest in the idea and ultimately influence them to work with
					you.<br />So
					how do you go about writing that email that effectively influences your audience to consider your
					idea?<br />Well, it turns out there are four tried and true steps of effective
					influencing.<br />Leadership expert Dr. Jay A. Conger identifies the steps to effective influencing
					as
					establish credibility, frame for common ground, provide evidence, and connect
					emotionally.<br />Let’s
					discuss each step.<br />The first step to effective influencing is to establish
					credibility.<br />During
					this step, you make the case for why your audience should listen to you.<br />According to
					Dr.<br />Conger, credibility comes from two sources, expertise and relationships.<br />You need to
					demonstrate to your audience that you’re an expert on a given topic whether that’s through
					professional
					experience, extensive research, or something else.<br />And you need to demonstrate relationship
					credibility by establishing that you’re honest, trustworthy, and someone who they’d want to work
					with.<br />To establish credibility, you might kick off your Office Green email by greeting the
					recipient by name, then writing something like I’m Elita, a lead project manager at Office
					Green.<br />Your colleague Alex passed on your contact information.<br />Alex and I work together to
					launch new services at Office Green before she joined your organization.<br />In these opening
					lines,
					you’ve established expertise credibility by introducing your role at Office Green and by subtly
					highlighting that you’ve launched new services in the past.<br />And to demonstrate relationship
					credibility, you’ve established that you and the recipient have a shared contact who has worked
					closely
					with you in the past and can vouch for your trustworthiness and emotional intelligence.<br />The
					second
					step is to frame for common ground.<br />In this step, you’ll make the case for how your idea can
					benefit your audience.<br />To determine this, you’ll need a strong understanding of your audience
					and
					their values.<br />In essence, what about your idea will appeal to them?<br />And how will they
					stand to
					benefit from agreeing to your idea?<br />In our Office Green email, you might establish that you’ve
					researched the organization extensively and believe that this new service might align with their
					current
					offerings.<br />For example, you might write something like this.<br />We’re launching a service to
					provide top clients with desk plans, and we’d like to explore a bundle offering to pair high-quality
					chocolate with each plant order.<br />I’ve admired your organization’s push in recent years to work
					with
					other lifestyle and wellness brands.<br />And I think there may be a great opportunity for us to
					collaborate.<br />In this portion of the email, you’ve established that you’ve done your research on
					the
					organization and that their previous partnerships indicate that working together might be a great
					fit.<br />The next step is to provide evidence.<br />In this step, you’ll make your case through
					hard
					data and persuasive storytelling.<br />Numbers aren’t strong enough on their own.<br />They need
					stories
					to liven them up.<br />In our Office Green email, you might appeal to your recipient with a line
					like we
					recently surveyed clients to gauge interest in this kind of offering and your brand came up again
					and
					again.<br />In this example, you provided evidence through the results of client surveys, which
					showed
					overwhelmingly positive brand recognition for our shared audience.<br />The last step is to connect
					emotionally.<br />In this step, you’ll demonstrate to your audience that you’re emotionally
					committed to
					your idea and you’ll do your best to match their emotional state.<br />In our Office Green email,
					you
					might demonstrate an emotional connection by tapping into their brand ethos.<br />For example, you
					might
					write something like we’ve been following your profile on Instagram and love your post on
					chocolate’s
					connection to living a well and balanced lifestyle.<br />Perhaps we can discuss combining forces to
					bring this message to an even wider audience?<br />And then you end your note with a friendly
					closer,
					something like if you’re interested, I’d love to connect and share what our partner program is all
					about.<br />To recap, establishing credibility, framing for common ground, providing evidence, and
					connecting emotionally are four proven effective steps you can apply when attempting to influence
					other.<br />Dr. Conger also identified four common mistakes that people make when attempting to
					influence others.<br />They’ll often approach their audience too aggressively.<br />And that tends
					to
					put people off ideas entirely.<br />They might also resist compromise, which is crucial for any kind
					of
					mutual agreement.<br />They’ll focus too much on developing their argument for the idea and not
					enough
					time establishing credibility, framing for common ground, providing evidence, and connecting
					emotionally.<br />And they’ll assume that they can work out an agreement through just one
					conversation.<br />These mistakes can jeopardize your attempts to influence others and limit your
					ability to build relationships.<br />So be mindful of these common mistakes when preparing to pitch
					another person on your big idea.<br />[MUSIC PLAYING] Earlier, you learn how your approach can
					impact
					your ability to influence others.<br />But influencing is about more than just your
					approach.<br />In
					fact, so much of your ability to influence others comes from your own sources of
					power.<br />Throughout
					your career, you’ll rely on your sources of power to influence others to do great work in service of
					the
					project goals.<br />In his book “The Elements of Power– Lessons on Leadership and Influence,” the
					researcher Terry Bacon determined that most power sources fall into two buckets, organizational and
					personal.<br />From these power sources, we picked out the ones we feel are most important to cover
					here.<br />Let’s start with organizational sources of power, which include your role, information,
					network, and reputation.<br />First, we have your role, which refers to your position within an
					organization or team.<br />In a project management role, you have a certain level of power over the
					project and, therefore, more influence.<br />Information is another source of organizational power,
					which refers to your level of access and control over information.<br />As a project manager, you
					possess a huge amount of information about your work and your stakeholders, which can work to your
					benefit.<br />Now it may be tempting to assume that as a leader you have all of the
					answers.<br />But to
					be a good influencer, you should ask questions and consider all ideas.<br />You may even hear new
					insights and notice issues in a different way.<br />Share information with your team regularly so
					that
					they can provide input on the full picture.<br />You can also derive power from your
					network.<br />This
					refers to people you’re connected with professionally and personally.<br />Strong connections within
					your organization and beyond it can boost your ability to influence others and help your project
					continue on.<br />If you demonstrate that you’re well connected and have a good chance of getting
					stakeholder support or budget approval for your plans, then you’re more likely to get your audience
					on
					your side.<br />You should use your network to help colleagues make new connections.<br />Your
					team’s
					effectiveness will increase as you take on the responsibility of helping each person develop their
					skills and expand their network, which in turn increases their own influencing power.<br />Lastly,
					we
					have reputation, which refers to how others perceive you overall.<br />As you might expect, people
					with
					positive reputations tend to be more influential than those with negative reputations.<br />One way
					I’ve
					noticed this play out is through collaboration.<br />If you’re a good collaborator, you can boost
					your
					reputation by becoming known for being easy to work with, keeping your commitments, and helping
					others
					achieve their own goals.<br />Your role, access to and control of information, network, and
					reputation
					are important organizational sources of power to be aware of.<br />It’s also important to identify
					power
					sources that come from you.<br />These are referred to as personal sources of power, which include
					knowledge, expressiveness, history, and character.<br />I like to think of these as your own
					personal
					superpowers.<br />Knowledge refers to the power that you draw from your expertise in certain
					subjects,
					your unique abilities and skill sets, and even your ability to learn new things.<br />What comes to
					mind
					when you think about an influential leader?<br />Typically, they have a lot of knowledge in their
					field.<br />And you’re more likely to trust their opinion.<br />When you’re considering how to use
					your
					own knowledge as a source of power, reflect on the expertise you already have, and consider areas
					where
					you still want to grow and learn more.<br />Expressiveness refers to your ability to communicate
					with
					others.<br />This is a big one.<br />As you learned earlier, so much of influencing comes down to
					how
					you approach your audience.<br />Maybe you’re a great storyteller or maybe you’re really good at
					connecting emotionally with people.<br />Strong communication skills like these can significantly
					increase your ability to influence others.<br />The next personal source of power is
					history.<br />History refers to the level of personal history there is between yourself and another
					person.<br />Makes sense, right?<br />A strong relationship with the person you hope to influence
					can go
					a long way.<br />As a project manager, you’ll be managing team dynamics and building team
					relationships,
					which can help you build up personal history with the people around you.<br />And, finally,
					character.<br />Character refers to other people’s view of the qualities that make you, you, like
					honesty, integrity, kindness, and so much more.<br />Character is a huge one.<br />You’ll derive an
					enormous amount of power from high estimates of your character.<br />What personal characteristics
					do
					you value within yourself?<br />These are the qualities that have the power to make you a strong,
					supportive leader for the people around you.<br />Knowledge, expressiveness, history, and character
					are
					just four personal sources of power.<br />But it’s important to remember that there’s so much
					wrapped in
					each one of these.<br />There’s trustworthiness, authenticity, wisdom, and on, and on.<br />There
					are so
					many attributes to draw power from.<br />I like to think of these elements as personal
					superpowers.<br />I learned early on in my career that my personal superpower is knowledge,
					specifically
					my innate curiosity.<br />When I started at Google, I didn’t have a background in software
					engineering.<br />But I’m a naturally curious person, and I’m not afraid to ask questions.<br />When
					I
					join a new team, I find the engineer who seems to have the most knowledge or experience and I ask
					them
					to teach me how everything works.<br />Most people are genuinely interested in sharing what they
					know.<br />That initial chat usually leads to conversations over lunch, which helps me to build my
					own
					knowledge and personal history with my colleague.<br />And through these conversations, I learn
					about
					other teammates to connect with, which increases my network.<br />As you build your career, try to
					identify your own superpowers.<br />Find the combination of influencing techniques that best suits
					your
					particular circumstances.<br />It takes practice to polish your skills and lean into various
					superpowers
					when working with others.<br />But if you invest time in thinking in troubleshooting your
					influencing
					strategy, it will pay off.<br />ROWENA: Congratulations on finishing this video in the Google
