					in Iowa there are many pigs there are four pigs P for every one human that's a lot of pigs the next
					State Kansas an interesting fact about Kansas is that two of the biggest fast food chain restaurants
					started in Kansas and those two chains are Pizza Hut Pizza Hut and White Castle I don't like either
					of these I do not think either of these are good if you want a hamburger I don't know why you would
					want to go to White Castle the hamburgers are little and greasy and if you want pizza I don't know
					why you would go to Pizza Hut I think Pizza Hut stinks okay I don't think their pizza's good so I
					don't want to go to Kansas Kentucky the next state is Kentucky the interesting fact about the state
					of Kentucky is that there is a military base a military base in Kentucky called Fort Knox and this
					is no ordinary base this is the military base the United States stores its entire reserve of gold
					Oro the United States stores its gold at a military base called Fort Knox in Kentucky and in Fort
					Knox there's roughly 6 billion billion mil million okay billion $6 billion worth of gold I would
					love to see that that would be so cool next state Louisiana an interesting fact about Louisiana is
					that there is a very heavy French influence on the state and in fact there's a very well-known uh
					holiday festival in Louisiana called Marty gr with which in French means Fat Tuesday Mari is Tuesday
					martes and gra means fat so marra is Fat Tuesday and this party is about eating drinking and doing a
					bunch of not so good things before lent okay lent is the Catholic uh tradition holiday I don't know
					how to say it I'm not Catholic where you give up something that you like for example if I love
					chocolate then for Lent I'm supposed to stop eating chocolate in Louisiana right before lent they
					celebrate a huge party a huge festival and do all their sins before they try to be better for Lent
					so uh Louisiana is a pretty cool State I've been to New Orleans they have super good seafood and you
					know I'm not a a big partyer but if you enjoy parties drinking music New Orleans is a cool place to
					go so Louisiana is cool next state Maine and and what Maine is very well known and famous for is
					their lobster Lobster industry Maine produces roughly 90% of all the lobsters that we eat here in
					the United States and they have a festival they have a big lobster festival a big party about
					lobsters there once a year and on that one day 20,000 lobsters are eaten next Maryland Maryland so
					an interesting fact that I found about the state of Maryland is that the official sport of the state
					is jousting jousting I didn't know people still joust but in Maryland Jousting is apparently a
					popular sport it's kind of cool I I think it's kind of cool next state then I'm going to tell you an
					interesting fact about Massachusetts try and say that word guys that's a good one Massachusetts can
					you say it Massachusetts Massachusetts Massachusetts all right guys an interesting fact about
					Massachusetts is that two very popular sports were created there okay and these two sports which I'm
					positive that you guys know about because they're known all around the world basketball and
					volleyball okay basketball and volleyball were created in Massachusetts so I would say Massachusetts
					has contributed something good to the world next Michigan Michigan is a state right next to my state
					and I've spent a lot of time there okay I've seen a lot of cool things in Michigan and one of the
					cool places that I have been in Michigan that I want to tell you something about is called MAA
					Island okay maau island is way up north in Michigan and to get there you have to take a boat you
					have to take a boat you cannot drive there you cannot drive there you have to take a boat to get
					there and once you get to the island the interesting thing that you will see is that there are no
					cars no cars and it is because it is illegal it is illegal to have a car on the island so the only
					thing you will see is bicycle schols and horses there are tons of horses and people use the horses
					to get around on the island guys ma island is beautiful it's a beautiful place as a matter of fact I
					would love to go there again and make a video for you guys because Mao island is truly a very cool
					place so maybe we'll do that this summer when it's a little nicer or maybe it might be a cool winter
					video Minnesota the next state I'll tell you about is Minnesota and Minnesota is known know as the
					Land of 10,000 lakes okay they say that there are 10,000 lakes in Minnesota but the real number is
					around 12,000 there are more or less more or less 12,000 lakes in Minnesota that's a lot and because
					there are so many lakes there's actually more more land that is Shoreline a Shore is the the area
					around a body of water than in California than on the coast of California californ that's a pretty
					interesting fact the next state that I will tell you about is Mississippi a fact about Mississippi
					is that it was once one of the richest States in all of the US and it is now one of the poorest why
					is that well because in the past the big huge industry in Mississippi was cotton farming cotton is a
					a plant that they use to make shirts okay this shirt is probably made of cotton it has cotton in it
					and the reason they were able to make so much money off of this in the past is because of slavery
					okay so they had slaves who did all this work for free made all this money in the cotton industry
					and these people who own the Farms were able to get filthy rich okay but after Abraham Lincoln ended
					slavery it was no longer a profitable industry because if you had to pay workers to come and do all
					the work you couldn't make as much money so miss Mississippi went from one of the richest countries
					to one of the poorest next state that I will tell you about Missouri Missouri an interesting fact
					about Missouri is that in the year 1947 the first drive-thru restaurant was invented so a drive-thru
					restaurant is where you you go to St McDonald's you drive up you say hey I'd like a Big Mac I'd like
					a large fry I'd like two4 Pounders I'd like a large drink I'd like a milkshake i' I'd like a 20
					piece chicken nugget I would like chicken okay you go and you tell them your order and then you
					drive around you pay they give you your money and you drive home and you get to eat your food so
					before they invented this in Missouri you had to actually go into a restaurant sit down and order
					your food Missouri made it easy for you to go and pick up your food without even leaving your car
					did they help us or did they hurt us and make us lazier I don't know next State the state of Montana
					an interesting fact about Montana is that it is home to two very large animals first it has a very
					large population of grizzly bears okay grizzly bears are the the biggest and most aggressive bears
					in the United States I see K qu qu Los grizzly in Montana and next Montana is one of the only places
					in the United States where you will still see Buffalo freely roaming around and eating and being
					Buffalo okay that's pretty cool next date Nebraska Nebraska an interesting fact about Nebraska is
					that the drink the drink Kool-Aid was invented there okay Kool-Aid was invented in Nebraska and it
					is home to a famous person who maybe some of you guys who like uh to learn about business may know
					about Warren Buffett okay Warren Buffett is from Nebraska and he still lives there one quick
					interesting fact about Warren Buffett that I like Warren is a multi billionaire okay he's one of the
					richest men in the world but he still lives in a small house in Nebraska okay so all the money in
					the world did not change Warren he's still a normal guy he's almost 90 years old now and he's been
					living in the same tiny little house in Nebraska for I don't even know 60 years and he's one of the
					richest guys to ever live so Warren's pretty cool I think okay guys the last state that I'm going to
					tell you about today is Nevada maybe you guys haven't heard of Nevada but I am positive that you
					have heard of a big city and a big famous city in Nevada and that is Las Vegas okay Las Vegas is in
					Nevada I'm positive you guys have heard about that you go to Las Vegas to gamble to play cards to
					try and make some money and there are some other things that are not so good in Las Vegas for
					example Las Vegas is the only place in all the United States where there is a a city that has legal
					prostitution Okay so so Las Vegas is kind of a place to go do bad stuff all right gamble lose your
					money I told you about the prostitution so really there's nothing in Las Vegas that interests me
					however Nevada the state has some cool stuff for example it is home to the Extraterrestrial Highway
					and Highway is a big road and the Extraterrestrial highway is a place where many many people claim
					to have witnessed UFOs UFO uh stands for unidentified flying object you guys say omes okay but here
					we say UFOs which is a spaceship for aliens or extraterrestrials all right guys I hope you enjoy
					this video leave me a comment give me a like I appreciate you all so much I wish you all the best of
					luck
