					Friends hello my friends if you do not already know me my name is Kyle my name is Kyle and here here
					on my channel English I bring you real English real English that you can understand that you can
					understand and today today I think that I have an interesting topic okay an interesting topic to
					talk to you about okay I am not I am not going to speak any Spanish any Spanish in this video but I
					am going to speak very clear nice and easy nice and slow so that you can understand me and practice
					practice your listening 100 in English Okay so the topic that I am going to talk about today is
					wasting time wasting time I'm going to talk about wasting time I'm going to talk about some ways
					that most people the majority of people waste time ways that I have wasted time and ways that we can
					use this time better in a more positive way to help us grow as people to help us learn to help us
					reach our goals okay now stay till the end of the video stay till the end of video because at the
					end I'm going to ask a question and I want you guys to write your answer in English Okay write your
					answer in English down in the comments to get some practice writing and expressing yourself in
					English so the first way that a lot of people waste time that I am going to talk about this is a bad
					one okay in my opinion this is a really bad one and it is a huge huge waste of time okay going going
					to a bar to drink to drink alcohol okay now now before you get mad with me for saying that going to
					a bar and drinking is bad listen to me okay I am not saying that it is bad to have a drink with your
					friend okay to go out and celebrate your best friend's birthday or to go out and celebrate if you
					got a promotion at your job things like that okay those are not bad if you're doing it once a month
					okay once every few months no problem okay because we still need to have fun we need to have fun and
					socialize with our friends meet new people okay so if you do it very rarely once in a while there's
					no problem there and also I am not not saying the alcohol is bad okay maybe you like to have a glass
					of wine with a good dinner when you go over to your friend's house you're talking with your friend
					and have a beer together okay that's all right what I am talking about is the people that go to the
					bars okay and drink every day or three times a week four times a week now I do not know I don't know
					maybe where you live not a lot of people go to the bars all the time several times every week three
					four five times a week but here I know I know a lot of people who go to bars after work for example
					and just sit there for two three four hours drinking Google talking with the same people who they
					see every day in that bar these people are called regulars at a bar and it means that they go to
					that bar all the time every everybody there knows their names okay the the bartender knows their
					names this is a huge huge waste of time and it's a huge waste of time because you are not gaining
					anything you are not learning new things you are not meeting new people really because it's all the
					same regulars and you talk about the same things they talk about politics oh I hate Joe Biden oh I
					hate Donald Trump they talk about the same thing every day over and over and over and they keep
					wasting their money and their time when they could have used that time and money to better
					themselves and get closer to their goals some of you guys who watch my videos all the time you know
					that I had a friend who passed away last year he died last year his name was Ernie and he was a
					great guy but Ernie had a big weakness okay a big weakness Ernie's weakness drinking alcohol okay
					Ernie drank way too much alcohol and he was one of those guys that would go to the bar all the time
					sit there and drink and talk with the same people about the same things and when I first met her in
					years and years ago I would go with him to the bar and we would drink laugh ha ha ha and it felt fun
					but after after a while he's talking about the same things making the same jokes all of the same
					people and I thought to myself I don't think I belong here I don't think these are my people and
					then one day something very deep happened when I was at a bar with Ernie okay there were there was
					an old man sitting at the bar drinking okay and he told me he told me you are young you were young
					and you could do whatever you want with your life do not waste your life sitting at this bar like I
					did he said I wasted my whole life sitting at this bar drinking talking to the same people he said
					you do not belong here you don't belong here don't waste your life like I did after that day I did
					not go to the bar with Ernie anymore he would call me and say hey man you want to go to the bar and
					I would say no man if you want to go fishing we could go fishing or practice guitar we could
					practice guitar but I do not go to the bar because that place is like a graveyard for people who are
					still alive okay so I stopped going to the bar with Ernie and it was a great great choice for my
					life okay second way that a lot of people waste a lot of time watching watching TV TV can be a huge
					waste of time if you are spending hours watching stupid shows reality shows but if you are spending
					hours and hours and hours watching shows that you are not learning anything from that's wasting time
					okay now I do not think that TV is all bad and there's nothing wrong with at the end of the day
					after you already worked hard and accomplished your goals and worked to become a better person
					there's nothing wrong with watching TV for an hour before bed to relax okay but I think it will be
					would be better if we watch things that we could learn from like documentaries or shows about
					history or science things like that but but if you really really really want to watch the dumb shows
					okay the reality shows or the cartoons there is a way that you can watch them and turn it from a
					waste of time to an investment of time okay how do you do that watch it in English okay if you watch
					these silly shows in English you are no longer wasting time because as you are watching them and
					relaxing and enjoying these shows your brain is absorbing input okay it is learning your brain is
					learning so it is no longer a waste of time it is an investment of time in your second language in
					English if these silly shows are your guilty pleasure guilty pleasure is something that you do in
					your spare time but you do not want everybody else to to know about because it's a little
					embarrassing so if watching these shows is your guilty pleasure do it in English do it in English
					Okay okay and the last the last thing that a lot of people waste a lot of time on social media okay
					now social media there are a lot of ways that you can use social media for good okay you can use it
					to learn you can use it to promote your business or your content okay I'm not saying that social
					media is bad because I use social media every day so don't get me wrong okay you can learn how to do
					anything in the world on YouTube you can learn super cool new recipes on Tic Tac you can promote
					your business on Instagram okay it is not all a waste of time but but a lot of times we get caught
					up scrolling scrolling reading about other people doing cool things when it should be us out there
					in the real world doing the cool things ourselves and becoming awesome people so once again another
					way that you can in turn this waste of time into an investment start following people who speak
					English okay if you like photography or traveling start following people who make content about
					these things but in English and then while you are watching the things you like to watch you're also
					acquiring more English okay guys so these were just my thoughts my thoughts and I am not judging
					anybody who spends a lot of time doing these things because I spent so much time I wasted so much
					time on these things in my past that I am embarrassed to even think about it I've wasted time hours
					and hours and hours in bars sitting in front of the TV watching dumb shows so I learned my lesson
					the hard way okay and honestly my sister drivers are so cool that I am sure I am certain that you
					guys spend your time a lot better A lot more wisely than the average person okay because here we are
					not average all right we are not average we are the people who are learning who are going after our
					goals and dreams okay I know my subscribers my subscribers you guys you guys are what is called
					go-getters okay go-getters are the people in this world who make things happen okay they take action
					to get what they want and I'm so proud of you guys okay guys now I'm done with my lecture I'm done
					with my lecture but I do want to give you guys a writing assignment okay a writing assignment
					today's homework down in the comments tell me tell me in English what are some ways that you have
					wasted your time in the past and what are some ways that you can use that time better to improve as
					a person all right my friends I said that I would not speak any Spanish so I cannot say what I
					always say but thank you so much for watching and I'll see you soon
