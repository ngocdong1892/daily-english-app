					Is Donald Trump Donald Trump listening and  hi guys I am Kyle welcome to pensano my channel
					where I help Spanish speakers like you to understand native English speakers like me and today today
					we are going to explore the life the achievements and the controversies of who is probably the most
					famous and Infamous person alive today Donald Trump so guys the truth is that there is a ton of
					content on the internet telling us that Donald Trump is an evil horrible person or that he is a hero
					who is trying to save his country from the people who want to destroy it but we are going to look at
					the facts without opinions so that all of us can choose for our ourselves who really is Donald Trump
					let's start at the beginning Donald Trump was born in 1946 in Queens New York he was born into a
					wealthy family and at the time of his father Fred Trump's death he had an estimated Fortune of $300
					million he earned this fortune in the business of real estate a lot of Trump's supporters and Trump
					himself like to view him as a self-made billionaire but can you truly claim to be self-made if your
					father was a very wealthy man in an interview Donald Trump even stated that his father helped him
					get started in his real estate career with a small loan of $1 million now I would like to make it
					clear I think it is a parents responsibility to help our children succeed if we can but I do not
					think that most of our parents are able to give us a small loan of $1 million so is he self-made I
					do not think so but that does not necessarily make him good or bad his father said that he was a
					difficult child so at the age of 13 they sent him to a military academy a military academy is
					basically a high school but with much more discipline and funny looking clothes in high school he
					played football and baseball and in an interview he claimed that he could have been a professional
					baseball player and and his High School baseball coach later came out and said that it was true that
					he was actually a great player and athlete so he was not lying about that even though he does have a
					reputation of exaggerating things after his time at the military academy he would go on to earn a
					bachelor's degree in economics from Wharton School of Finance which by the way is considered to be a
					great business school now Trump also claims to be a genius but he has never made his grades in
					school public so can only judge his intelligence based off of the success that he has had in his
					life and to be fair he has had a lot of it now Trump's father his real estate career focused on
					apartment buildings and low rent housing but his son wanted bigger things he decided that he wanted
					to build skyscrapers or the huge buildings that we see in big cities around the world one of his
					most well-known projects is Trump Tower in New York City he's been involved in several other
					business ventures such as hotels and casinos and though all of his casinos have closed down and are
					considered to be failures he still has luxury hotels in Chicago New York and Las Vegas he has
					written many books but it is well known that he used ghost writers a ghost writer is somebody who
					you tell your ideas to and they write the book he later found huge success on television he hosted a
					very popular show called The Apprentice for 4 14 Seasons he used this show where contestants would
					compete in business challenges to promote his image as a successful and charismatic businessman and
					when a contestant would lose he would tell them that they had to leave with his famous catchphrase
					you fired and though in his business career he has had ups and downs before his political career he
					was very popular in the United States he was loved and idolized by the public and by other
					celebrities so so why did people turn on him why did so many people start to hate him after he said
					he would run for president well if you ask one of his supporters they will say it is because the
					fake news media tells lies about him because they don't want him to succeed and make the country
					great again but if you ask one of his critics they will say that it's because many of his policies
					are racist homophobic that he himself is a sexist and basically just a horrible person so let's get
					down to the facts what did he even say that he would do if he won the presidency one of his biggest
					promises was that he would build a Great Wall on the Mexican United States border and that he would
					make Mexico pay for it he promised to cut and lower taxes and he promised to ban travel from
					majority Muslim countries that were known to have terrorist regimes he also said that he would
					create 25 million new jobs for American citizens so guys do you think that these promises sound good
					and sound like a president who is fighting for his people or do you agree with his critics that his
					policies are sometimes racist and cruel and those were only his promises for his first term as
					president now that he has won the presidency for a second time he is already facing all kinds of new
					controversies one of which is immigration this is perhaps the most contr veral Topic in the United
					States right now and Donald Trump is right in the middle of it many people are scared that he is
					going to have ice agents going into schools and churches ripping immigrants out of their homes and
					sending them back to their countries in handcuffs while at the same time many other United States
					citizens are very happy that somebody is finally doing something about the millions of people who
					broke the country's law and entered illegally so my friends he is a man who has made billions of
					dollars he has been a celebrity on television and in newspapers for decades and he is perhaps at the
					same time the most loved and the most hated man in the country so I ask you tell me in the comments
					below do you think that Donald Trump is a Superhero fighting for freedom and good people all around
					the world or is he an evil dictator who wants to push an agenda of hate and destroy the decency I
					look forward to reading your comments
