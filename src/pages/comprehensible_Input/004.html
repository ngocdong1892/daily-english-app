					Hello everybody, welcome back. Are you ready to improve your English? Well, today we are going to
					improve our English with comprehensible input.<br>
					Comprehensible input is when a native speaker like me speaks in a way that you can understand. Okay?
					Now, this could be by using pictures, by using videos, by drawing, or just by speaking slowly and
					clearly. So today I'm just going to speak slowly and clearly because this is an intermediate level
					English video. So today we're going to use questions and answers to help you well know how to ask
					questions and how to answer them, but also just to acquire to absorb my native language of English.
					So, I asked Chat GPT to give me a list of questions and I'm going to respond to them so that you
					guys can hear one, how to ask the question, two, how to respond to it, and three, just get some good
					English. And who knows, maybe I'll even have some interesting answers. Let's go.
					<br>One, what's your
					name? My name is Kyle Kalitoante.<br>
					Two, where are you from? I'm from a state in the United States of America called Indiana. It is up
					towards the north, the north of the country. And the biggest city that you guys would know about for
					sure that I'm close to is Chicago. So, I go to Chicago a lot because there's great food and fun
					things to do, but I live in the state right next to it called Indiana.<br> Three.
					How old are you? I am 33 years old.<br>
					Four. What do you do? I work for the biggest steel making company here in the United States. And in
					my free time, I help people like you to learn English.<br>
					Five. Are you married? I am married to the most beautiful woman on earth. So, yes, I'm very happily
					married. <br>Six. Do you have any siblings? Yes, I have siblings. And in case anybody isn't familiar
					with this word, siblings is a word that we use for brothers and sisters. So, I have two sisters and
					one brother. Okay? But here's where it gets a little bit complicated. I have one sister that has the
					same mother and father as me. Okay? And then I have another sister who only has the same dad. She
					has a different mom. So, in English, we call her my halfsister. My halfsister. Okay? And then her
					husband, I call him my brother because they got married when I was like 8 or 9 years old. <br>Seven.
					What languages do you speak?
					My native language, my first language is English. And when I was 27, I started speaking Spanish. I
					speak Spanish pretty well. I understand most things. So, I could say I'm fluent in Spanish. And I
					speak French. My French is not as good as my Spanish, but I'm getting much, much better. I'm
					starting to understand most of what I hear, and I'm very excited about that.<br> Eight. Do you have
					any
					pets? I have a dog named Oreo. Some of you guys have seen her before, but she lives with my mother.
					Okay. When when my father passed away and I left my mom's house, I left the dog with my mom to
					protect her and keep her company. In my house, we have one guinea pig named Gwen. <br>Nine. Where do
					you
					live? I live in a small city in Indiana. Not going to say the name, but it's a nice place.
					There's a lot of places like this where I could go and be alone in nature. So, I like that a lot. I
					do not live in a big city. It's a small town.<br> 10. What's your favorite color? My favorite color.
					I
					think every color has something that's beautiful, but I really love to be out here in nature and see
					all of the green.
					So, I guess maybe you could say green.<br>
					11. What do you usually do on the weekends? Well, sometimes I work on the weekends, so I'm not
					always doing something fun. But the days that I'm not working, I'm spending time with my family,
					eating delicious food, trying to go on adventures. Uh, you know, when you work on the weekends
					sometimes and your days off or during the week, you don't think about weekends anymore or weekdays.
					I do the same stuff every day, guys. I try and enjoy every single day.<br>
					12. What time do you usually wake up?
					Well, at my job, sometimes I work at night, sometimes I work during the day.
					So, it's hard to say what time I really wake up. If I'm working during the day, I wake up sometimes
					at 4:30 a.m. Uh, on my days off, I usually wake up around 7:00 a.m. And if I'm working midnights,
					I'll wake up around 7:00 a.m.
					And then at 12:00 p.m., I'll try and take a nap for a couple hours. and then I'll wake up again and
					go to work. My sleep schedule, guys, is really messed up, unfortunately. <br>13. Do you like coffee
					or
					tea? I love coffee. I'm a big-time coffee drinker, but I'm trying to slow down and drink less coffee
					now.
					I think it'll be good for my health. So, that's something I've really been working on lately. Even
					though I love it, I want to drink less. <br>14. What kind of music do you like? To be honest, guys,
					I
					don't listen to a whole lot of music. I usually listen to podcasts or YouTube videos. I like to
					consume information, but I like rock. I think guitar is an awesome instrument. And so, really, if I
					listen to music, I listen to rock. <br>15. Do you like to cook? I love to cook, guys. I think that
					cooking is one of my best skills, and I think my wife would agree. I love to cook. Cook all the
					time, guys. Almost every day.
					Every day, really. 16. <br>Do you play any sports? I don't play any sports right now. I go to the
					gym
					four or five times a week. And I like to run, but I wouldn't consider that a sport. And I trained
					Brazilian jiu-jitsu for several years, but it's very hard on your body.
					So, I quit doing that. So, no real sports right now. <br>17. What do you like to do in your free
					time?
					In my free time, oh, I make these videos. I love coming out in nature, going on walks or hikes. I
					love to spend time with my wife and my son. Take them with me out in places like this. I like to
					meditate. I like to read good books. Like to watch videos where I can learn things from.
					Sometimes I take language classes on italki. Just yesterday, I took a really good French lesson with
					a guy from France named Triston, and it was really cool. So, those are my things, guys. I'm always
					trying to improve myself somehow.<br>
					18. What's your favorite food? My favorite food? Steak, guys. I love a good steak on the grill.
					Nothing better.
					Love it. Absolutely love it. <br>19. What's your favorite movie? My favorite movie?
					I think so many good movies, guys. But if I had to say what I think the best movie ever is, I would
					say it's actually three movies. The Lord of the Rings trilogy. I think they're the best movies ever.
					And I think they're the best because they're awesome. And there is no cuss words, no sex scenes,
					nothing bad.
					And it shows that if you really take the time to write a good script and have amazing actors, you
					don't have to put all that bad stuff in it to make a cool movie. Lord of the Rings is awesome.
					<br>20.
					What do you usually do after work or school? Well, guys, I work 12-hour shifts. So, after you get
					off of a 12-hour shift, you really just want to eat dinner and relax with your family.
					So, usually guys, when I get off work, if I worked all night, I get off in the morning, I go right
					to sleep. But if I work during the day, I get home at about 700 p.m. I just like to eat dinner,
					chill with my family, maybe watch something on the TV with my wife and son, and just relax. <br>21.
					Have
					you ever traveled to another country? Yes, I have been to Colombia, technically Panama, and recently
					we spent some time in Canada. I've been to Puerto Rico, which was actually a territory of the United
					States, so that doesn't count.
					But, uh, countries that I've actually spent time in and met the people and had a good time, Colombia
					and Canada. I recently went to Montreal to practice my French. I loved it. <br>22. What's the best
					place
					you've ever visited? The best place I've ever visited, guys. I don't know. It was definitely
					probably somewhere in Colombia, just up in the mountains. Sento was a beautiful little town, guys.
					Incredible. Really, all of the Ahe Cafeterero was incredible. Just beautiful nature, guys. And just
					being there with my wife's family. So, definitely Colombia. Somewhere in Colombia for sure.
					<br>23rd. Do
					you prefer the city or the countryside? I prefer the countryside, guys. I prefer to be out here in
					the woods. Sometimes I like to go to the city, but really just for food or if there's an event
					happening.
					Usually, I like to be out here by myself somewhere peaceful. <br>24. Have you ever tried a strange
					food?
					In Colombia, I ate some fruits that were not very good, and Lulo juice, Lulo, I think it's called,
					was terrible. Sorry, guys. That was very weird for me. I did not like it at all.
					And I've probably eaten a ton of foods that a lot of people think are strange, but I actually like
					them, so they're not strange to me. <br>25. Do you believe in love at first sight? I don't believe
					in
					love at first sight. I believe that you could be very attracted to somebody and have a really good
					feeling about them.
					But you have to really know somebody to love them. And you have to see them in their bad times. If
					you've never seen somebody when they're going through hard times and you still want to be with them
					and support them and be there to make those bad times a little bit easier, I don't think you could
					really say you love them. <br>26. What's something you're really good at? I'm really good at
					cooking.
					I'm pretty good at learning languages. I think I'm a really good father. Say I'm pretty good at
					talking.
					<br>27. What's something you'd like to learn? Maybe something like climbing a mountain. how to climb
					a
					mountain or Oh, I would love to learn how to fly a plane. How to fly like a little private plane or
					a helicopter. I think that would be pretty cool. <br>28. Do you enjoy learning English? Well, guys,
					it
					asked me, do I enjoy learning English?
					Obviously, I speak English, so I'll I'll answer the question like it asked me, do I enjoy learning
					languages? I love learning languages. I think it's an adventure. I think you get to see a new
					culture and a whole new part of the world. Yeah, I think learning a language is one of the most
					fulfilling and fun things you could do in the world in my opinion. <br>29. What do you think about
					social media? Social media can be great, guys. I've learned so much so many things from YouTube, but
					scrolling on Tik Tok and Instagram and Facebook, that's terrible for you guys. It's like a drug. It
					really is. really is like a drug for your brain and it actually activates the same parts in your
					brain as cocaine. So, think about that next time you're scrolling on Instagram for an hour. You
					might as well just be doing a drug. Sorry, guys. <br>30. Have you ever had a part-time job? I've
					never
					had a part-time job, guys. I've always worked long hours. I've worked in very industrial places. So,
					I never had a part-time job where I worked a couple days a week. Uh, it would be cool, but I've
					always needed more money than just a little bit. So, I never had a part-time job. I've been working
					a lot since I was pretty young. Since I was 18, I've had steady, hard jobs. So, nope. Never had a
					part-time job. Okay, guys. I hope that this video was useful for you. Maybe you enjoyed some of the
					answers. Maybe hearing me respond to these questions helped clear something up that you've been
					thinking about in English. And maybe you just enjoyed having a conversation with an English-speaking
					friend. All right, guys.
