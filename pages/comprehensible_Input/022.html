					Are you ready to learn some real life English with comprehensible input? Well, good, because today
					we're going to improve our English with an awesome video in the gym. Let's go. Hello, guys.
					It is your English speakaking friend, Kyle. And today, we're going to improve our English with
					comprehensible input..<br>
					What is comprehensible input?
					Comprehensible input is when a native speaker like me speaks slowly and clearly so that you can
					understand..<br>
					Guys, today we have a video that is so special. And this is going to be wow, one of the coolest
					videos we've done on the channel. Today we are in a gym.
					Okay, but we are not just in a gym working out with a bunch of people around. Today we have a whole
					gym. This whole gym, guys, we rented out this whole gym so that I can show you guys all of the
					English vocabulary that all of you fit people need to know to talk about working out, doing cardio,
					lifting weights, even some boxing and martial arts. Super excited, guys. This is going to be an
					awesome video. And camera wife and I have this whole gym, all this space. So, we're going to learn
					so much today, guys. And I'm going to get a little workout in. Camera wife might, too. As the
					channel grows and starts making money, I'm going to use that money to invest and things like this so
					I could keep on bringing you guys awesome content. What should we do first, camera wife?
					I don't know..<br>
					Camera wife doesn't know.
					Many options..<br>
					Many options. Let's warm up with a little bit of cardio. Okay, guys. This is called a treadmill. And
					I guess I should tell you uh cardio is short for cardiovascular.
					Okay, it means your breathing and vascular is your blood. So things like running, jumping rope,
					walking, those are cardiovascular activities. We call that doing cardio. A lot of times I'll warm up
					on the treadmill. Warming up is what you do before you work out so that you don't get hurt.
					Something interesting I like to do on the treadmill, guys. A lot of times when I go to the gym
					before work, I'll get on the treadmill and read and answer your guys's comments. So, a lot of the
					times when I answer comments, I'm walking on the treadmill. That way, I'm using my time very wisely.
					So, I like to walk or run for 10 or 15 minutes before I work out. Some people come to the gym just
					to run on the treadmill. To be honest, I prefer to run and walk outside cuz I like to see nature.
					The only time I use a treadmill is when I'm warming up usually. All right, guys. Right now, I am
					talking to a mirror. Camera wife thought this would be a cool shot. So, I want to tell you guys
					about probably my favorite form of cardio, jumping rope..<br>
					This is called a jump rope and you use it to jump rope. I think this is a super cool form of cardio.
					A lot of martial artists, boxers jump rope. It helps you with your your footwork for boxing and
					martial arts. And it makes your cardiovascular system much stronger, much better, and it's fun. I
					like it..<br>
					So, let's jump a little bit of rope..<br>
					There's a lot of different ways you could jump rope. This is the very basic way. Then you could
					start changing your feet. This is called the boxer step. And it took me a long time to learn these
					different tricks. Maybe it looks easy, but it's really not. You could do high knees, run in place,
					switch over. Jumping rope is not easy..<br>
					Even if it looks easy, it's a great workout. You could hear I'm already breathing kind of heavy, but
					I think it's really fun. All right, guys. This section is really cool. Something I really like. This
					is like a boxing martial arts section of the gym. Super cool cuz I love martial arts. These are
					called boxing gloves and you use them to do what? Wife..<br>
					It's a box. So guys, they've got all the equipment here. This is all stuff that I've spent a lot of
					time training training on before. I trained mixed martial arts with Miguel Torres. And I also had a
					few boxing lessons with a professional boxer. That was really cool. This is a workout, guys. Boxing
					is a crazy workout. So, let's check out some of the things that they have over here. Camera wife,
					what is this called?.<br>
					Punching bag.
					Punching bag. Because what do you do to it?
					Punch..<br>
					Punch it. Punching bag. Okay. But this is a a specific type of punching bag.
					It's called a heavy bag. Why is it called a heavy bag, wife?.<br>
					Cuz it's heavy..<br>
					Because it's heavy. Okay. Let me show you guys a couple of different punches.
					Because in boxing, the different punches, the different ways that you hit, they have different
					names. Maybe some of you guys are into fighting, into watching the UFC, into watching boxing.
					And this would be very useful. What is this, wife?.<br>
					That's a jab. A jab is with your front hand. Jab. You could jab somebody's head. You jab their body.
					This is called a cross because you come over across your body. That's your strong hand.
					Okay? In boxing, you keep your weaker hand forward. Boom, boom, boom. Your strong hand you keep
					back. That's the hard punch. That's the punch that knocks people out. So, a lot of times in boxing,
					they'll say one, two, one, two..<br>
					One is your jab. Two is your what? Wife..<br>
					Baby, I'm trying to record you..<br>
					Two is your cross. So, one, one, one, two, one, two, one, one, one, two.
					What's the most important thing in boxing life?.<br>
					Reset your face..<br>
					Wow, smart wife. So, when you throw your punches, boom. You bring it right back cuz you don't want
					to get hit. So, we've got a heavy bag. This is another kind of heavy bag, but it goes all the way
					down..<br>
					Why does it go all the way down, wife?.<br>
					Cuz you can use your legs. Because this is mixed martial arts gym here, too. So, you can kick.
					Practice your leg kicks or your high kicks..<br>
					That's pretty cool. Got another heavy bag..<br>
					This is a very heavy bag. Now, with this, they would practice like body shot. And you see how I'm
					turning my body. A lot of your power when you're throwing punches comes from your hips.
					Your hips. So then over here, this is for practicing what, wife?.<br>
					I don't know..<br>
					Reflexes fast..<br>
					You don't want to hit it hard. You hit it fast. Just touch it. You think this is easy, wife?
					No..<br>
					I want camera wife to try that..<br>
					Okay, guys. Camera life is going to show us if this is easy or hard.
					Oh my gosh. No. I don't know. So, I just have to hit punch it like or what?
					Just with one hand..<br>
					Both. Wow. You're doing really good..<br>
					kind of kind of..<br>
					Now, guys, she's doing good because she's actually practiced boxing a lot.
					I've showed her a lot and she is she's actually becoming pretty skilled, but we haven't boxed in a
					while. All right, guys. And the last kind of punching bag I'll show you, this is called a speed bag.
					Now, I haven't done one of these in a while, so give me a minute to get used to it. This is all
					about finding the rhythm. This is hard, too. Some people are really good. They could use both hands.
					This is another one like jumping rope. It looks easy, but believe me, it's not. Some people could d
					I never really practiced a lot with it, but it's good for you. And we're also going to see if camera
					life can do this..<br>
					Oh, that's very difficult. I remember I tried the other the other day. Look at like just like that.
					Mhm..<br>
					Good job, baby..<br>
					All right, guys. This is a boxing ring..<br>
					Let's check this out. Pretty cool, guys..<br>
					Now, I've only been in a boxing ring before when I was doing those lessons with that professional
					boxer. He had one of these set up in his gym, but it's super cool that they have this, guys.
					It's a nice little setup to work out..<br>
					Now, a lot of times people come up here and spar. Sparring is when you're you're practicing fighting
					with your friends..<br>
					You're really not trying to hurt each other. You're just practicing.
					Uh, you know, they're not doing real fights here in the gym. They're just sparring. Being in here
					makes me want to train martial arts again. It's been a long time, but I still remember a lot, and I
					have a lot of good memories in places like this. All right, let's find something else to show you.
					All right, guys. These are rings. Rings. And you could use them for pull-ups. Uh, a lot of good
					exercises you could do with these. And these are a lot harder than just a bar that stays still
					because you have to stabilize yourself. So, do you think I could do pull-ups, camera? Yes.
					How many you think I could do?.<br>
					I don't know why you can't..<br>
					Let's see. Take a guess how many I could do. Life..<br>
					What? You think I'm Popey?
					What you think I'm Popey?.<br>
					What is that?
					This is Popeye, guys.
					Pap.
					Yeah.
					Five.
					Five. Only five.
					I do.
					4 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 15 Wow..<br>
					15. I didn't think I could do that much, guys. I'm actually pretty happy with that. what I was just
					doing. Those are called pull-ups. So, I was doing pull-ups on the rings. That was a little bit
					difficult, guys. Give me a minute to catch my breath. Catching your breath means you need a minute
					to calm down so you could breathe normal again. All right, guys. Something else I forgot to mention,
					the clothes that you wear when you go to the gym, cuz most people don't go to the gym in jeans and a
					jacket or a coat. So, you need athletic clothes..<br>
					Athletic means something related to sports. Okay? So, this is called a t-shirt, but this material is
					usually what they make athletic shirts out of..<br>
					Something comfortable, something you can move around in. These usually we would call these
					sweatpants, guys. But this particular style where it gets skinnier when it goes down, when it gets
					tighter, they call these joggers. What is jogging, wife?.<br>
					Jogging. Jogging. Yeah..<br>
					Jogging. Jogging is running but like a slow, calm run. Okay. And shoes. Wo wait wait wait wait wait.
					Guys, I never buy myself anything. Never. The other day I was at the store. I saw these shoes. I was
					like, you know what? Camera wife's going to be so proud of me because I'm going to buy these shoes
					so I have some nice shoes to wear in the gym video. And I get home and you know what she said?
					Sonaros..<br>
					Sayaros.
					That means they're weird. Guys, what? I thought camera wife was gonna be happy.
					So, look at these shoes and tell me, are they weird, guys?.<br>
					I thought they were nice. Anyway, guys, we would call these running shoes or gym shoes because you
					use them where, wife?.<br>
					To run.
					Why would we call them gym shoes?.<br>
					Because Where do you use them, wife?.<br>
					At the gym.
					At the gym. That's a smart wife. All right, guys. So, athletic clothes. You wear athletic clothes to
					the gym. nice t-shirt, some sweatpants or joggers, and some gym shoes or running shoes. All right,
					let's talk about lifting weights..<br>
					Lifting weights, how you get big muscles. What is this called, wife?
					Bar something..<br>
					Bar something. It's called a barbell, guys. This is called a barbell..<br>
					Bar.
					And what do you put on the barbell, wife?.<br>
					Uh, weight that the disc guys on there, guys. My English is going no good right now. And these
					they're they're weights..<br>
					They're weights. They're heavy, but what we call them is plates. Plates like what you eat off of cuz
					they're that shape..<br>
					So these are plates. And you put plates on the barbell. So there's a lot of different exercises,
					guys, that you can do with the barbell. I'll show you some super basic ones. I'm not going to lift
					anything heavy. I don't want to hurt myself. So guys, this is called a overhead press or sometimes
					they call it a military press. What is this called, wife? You know what that's called?
					Um um I forgot..<br>
					Squat.
					Squat.
					That is a squat.
					Can you do it in that way? That's it..<br>
					Right now, what am I doing, wife?.<br>
					Squat.
					Squatting.
					Squatting.
					Squatting. What is this one called?.<br>
					I don't know.
					This is called a deadlift..<br>
					Oh, yeah.
					And this one?.<br>
					I don't know. It rows. That's called rows or rowing because it's the same movement as rowing a boat.
					All right. Come over here, camera wife. Come on. Come on, camera wife. We're in the gym. Move fast.
					These guys are called dumbbells. There's a ton of exercises that you could do with dumbbells. You
					could do these. These are called curls, and they work your bicep, this part of your arm. Don't
					worry, guys. I'm going to show you all I'm not going to show you all of my muscles, but I'm going to
					tell you the name for all the muscles in English, so you could know. Camera wife would be mad at me
					if I start showing you guys all my muscles..<br>
					So, you could do curls with these. You could do overhead presses, which works your shoulders.
					There's a lot of things you could do with these dumbbells. These are super important equipment in a
					gym..<br>
					Over here, we have another kind of weight. So, guys, dumbbells, barbells, they're all weights.
					Weight means it's heavy and it's something you lift. These are called What? Wife? You know this,
					baby? You know this. Camera wife's making a face like this. I don't know. I don't know.
					I feel so bad right now that I don't have..<br>
					It's okay, baby. You know these things.
					These are called kettle bells. Okay..<br>
					And kettle bells are great. There's tons of exercises you could do with these.
					You could do the normal stuff like curls, presses, but there's also tons of things you could do with
					these that you can't do with anything else. Like this is a popular one, kettle bell swings.
					because you're swinging it. You can pick them up off the ground like this. Boom.
					Fighters like to use kettle bells a lot because the way they move, it's not like really controlled
					movements. It's a lot of lot of movement. The kind of muscles you need for fighting and things like
					that. Kettle bells are super good. I like using kettle bells a lot. Kas, what else? Wife, what are
					you going to have me do?.<br>
					Oh, wife has to do some workouts. Okay.
					All right, guys. I am camera husband.
					Show me your favorite exercise to do with dumbbells..<br>
					Dumbbells?
					Oh, no. Here. Here, wife..<br>
					I know.
					So, for my arms or what?
					Whatever exercise you like to do with dumbbells..<br>
					I don't really like I have to do it..<br>
					Well, I do this like that.
					Wow. Camera wife is strong..<br>
					Like this and up. One of my shoulders make a noise. And then I don't know. Let me think.
					Do lunges.
					Oh, okay. Lunges.
					So guys, these are called lunges..<br>
					Wait, maybe I can do it.
					Yeah, do it like that. Okay, these are lunges, guys. And these are a super good exercise for your
					legs and your butt..<br>
					Okay, guys. Camera wife told me I have to show you this exercise. This one is for the ladies. So,
					when you go into a gym, you see women working out. camera wife. When women are lifting weights, what
					are they doing?
					For legs and for legs and booty..<br>
					All the women want to have strong legs and nice strong butts.
					And every man wants a good woman..<br>
					Every man wants his woman to have nice legs and a nice butt.
					So, I'm showing you this so that when you ladies go to the gym, you know what this is called. This
					is called a hip thrust. Your hip, you're thrusting. This is a thrust. That movement means to thrust.
					So these are hip thrust. And any gym you go to in the United States, you'll see women everywhere
					doing hip thrust. So hip thrust. Hip thrust. And this works the back of your legs and your butt. The
					thing that every woman wants and every man wants to. Come on, guys. Tell me the truth, fellas. Hip
					thrust. I think camera wife wants me to get a bigger butt. That's why she told me to do this. All
					right, guys. That was a barbell hip thrust. This guys we call a bench. A bench. And the most common
					exercise you'll see on a bench. It's what wife? It's for your chest..<br>
					Oh yeah.
					Bench press. So just like every time you go to a gym, you'll see the girls with big booties. Booty
					is a word that we use for butt. It's like the the idiom, okay? The native thing to say, "Oh, look at
					her booty. That girl's got a big booty." So the girls all want to have nice butts.
					What do the men want? Big shoulders, big arms, big chest..<br>
					So just like you see the girls doing hip thrust, you see the men doing this bench press. So this is
					what the men do all over the country. All right, guys. I just saw they have this. I want to show you
					one more exercise. It's one of my favorites for chest and shoulders. This is called dips. This is a
					super good exercise. One of my favorites..<br>
					I thought I was just recording today, but I'm getting a good workout. Oh, guys, let me tell you
					another very native expression that you'll hear around gym bros, guys that go to the gym a lot. A
					pump. So, I have a pump right now. What's that mean, wife?.<br>
					You're pumping.
					It means your blood's flowing and your blood is in your muscles.
					Pumping blood.
					Pumping blood..<br>
					So, we call it a pump because all your blood is pumping. That means your muscles are full of blood
					and looking good.
					They look bigger, right?.<br>
					They look bigger. So, anytime you ever see your favorite fitness person on Instagram, there's two
					things that make them look better than they actually do..<br>
					Do you know what they are with?.<br>
					Yeah.
					What?
					They have to do that before.
					They have a pump and what else?.<br>
					I don't know.
					Awesome lighting..<br>
					Oh, yeah. So guys, light, bright light overhead makes your muscles have shadows, makes you have
					better abs, and they get a pump before they work out..<br>
					And in between photos, they're also pumping themselves out. So don't feel bad when you see these
					Instagram people because they have a pump, they have awesome lights, and there's another thing that
					they're doing that is illegal, so I don't want to talk about it. things that help you get bigger.
					90% of the famous people who you see with awesome bodies are using something illegal to make their
					muscles bigger..<br>
					So, don't judge yourself based on those professionals, okay? Because they're professionals. They get
					paid to do that so they could do it all day. And sometimes they're using things that you don't want
					to use because you follow the law. All right, guys. Another thing when we're talking about
					weightlifting, there's two different kinds of weights really. and the barbells, the kettle bells,
					the dumbbells, those we call free weights because you can move them anywhere. They're free to move
					around..<br>
					Machines are the other kind. Okay, guys.
					So, they've got some machines over here.
					And machines are good, but I prefer free weights because you use more muscles when you do free
					weights because you not only are you lifting the weight, but you also have to control it yourself.
					The machines stay exactly in that position, but free weights you have to control.
					So, here's a rowing machine and you use it to row. This actually a really good one because you could
					change the the grip. So, a rowing machine. Camera wife is standing on a leg press machine. Back up.
					Camera wife. I'm trying to work out and get a pump. This is called a leg press because you use your
					legs to do what?.<br>
					To press.
					To press. This is a leg press. Super good machine. Let me get it.
					People use the plates, too..<br>
					Oh, yeah. Of course, guys. You put the plates on. I'm doing all this without weight because if I put
					a bunch of weight, I wouldn't be able to talk and I might hurt myself because I didn't warm up. But
					anyway, this is leg press. I'm going to get a couple reps in. Couple of reps.
					Repet repetitions..<br>
					Ah, smart wife. Reps is another word that you'll hear in the gym and it's short for repetitions. So
					one rep, two reps, three reps. Okay. So that was three reps. That was one set.
					So a set is another very important word..<br>
					Set means the groups, the groups of repetitions. So if you're looking at a workout online, a
					program, it'll say three sets of 10. So that means you do 10 repetitions. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10.
					You do that. That's one set. So, you do that three times. Okay? And three sets of 10 is the famous
					workout program. I don't like to do that that much. I like to do four sets of four or things like
					that. Go a little bit heavier. But those are just uh an example. A set is the group and a rep is
					each time you do it..<br>
					All right, guys. I forgot to show you the most basic exercise in the world.
					This is the exercise that everybody starts out with. Push-ups. Wow, I almost messed up, guys. I
					almost didn't even show you push-ups. What a bad teacher..<br>
					These are push-ups..<br>
					And guys, I'm not very good with push-ups really. I used to be able to do a lot more, but when I
					hurt my shoulder in jiu-jitsu, push-ups and bench presses, anything where you have to use this
					really hurts me. And I I'm I'm sad about it because those were my favorite.
					Bench press was my favorite and strongest exercise. But ever since I hurt myself doing jiu-jitsu, uh
					my back is a lot stronger now, so I could do pull-ups a lot easier. Sit-ups. Wife, why don't you
					tell me to show sit-ups?.<br>
					Camera wife is not doing her job. She knows that she has to be my memory sometimes. So, all the
					young teenage boys do a million sit-ups because they want to have a nice stomach to make the girls
					look at them. So, this is a sit up because you're doing what, wife?
					Sitting now, cuz this is sitting. This is sitting.
					Sitting on your butt. So, a sit up. You sit up. So, I'm doing sit-ups. That's for your your abs. And
					abs is another very uh native expression for your abdominals. Okay, these muscles, the muscles in
					your stomach. Uh your abdominal muscles, but we'll say abs. Or if you have very nice abs, we call it
					a six-pack because there's like 1 2 3 4 5 six different muscles there depending on your genetics.
					Some people have eight..<br>
					All right, guys. So now I want to show you the different muscles, okay? the different names for the
					muscles. So you can explain if you're at a gym, oh, I want to make this bigger. I want to work on
					this. Very important to know. So let's start with the arms. Okay, this part of your arms is called
					the forearm..<br>
					Okay, the forearm is this part. Forearms determine how strong your grip is. Okay, your forearms.
					Then you move up here.
					What's that, wife?.<br>
					Bicep.
					Bicep. your bicep and the back.
					Tricep, tricep. What a good smart wife. I'm so proud of her. Okay. Forearm, bicep, tricep.
					So, your shoulder muscle is called deltoid. Okay. Your deltoids. This part are your traps. We say
					traps. This muscle here that you get from doing shrugs. Your traps. We call it traps, but it's
					really trapezius..<br>
					Here is your chest, but the technical term is pectoral muscles, but the old school bodybuilders will
					just call it your pecs. Okay, your pecs. Look what I could do with my pec wife. I used to do that in
					school and people would be like, "How do you do that?" Because I trained when I was a little
					teenager. I was like, "Woo, one day I'm going to do this and the girls are going to like it." Don't
					know. Don't do that, wife. Because guess what? No girl ever cared. The girls are probably like,
					"Weirdo. What are you doing, guys? When I was in high school, I didn't have a bunch of luck with
					girls." I didn't have any girls until I met Camera Wife..<br>
					Yes.
					All right, guys. Your chest, your pectoral muscles or your pecs. I already said your abs on your
					back. This part up here is your traps. Like I said, these side parts of your back are called your
					lats. Your lats. Uh, upper back, lower back.
					Camera wife, what is the front part of your legs?.<br>
					I don't remember.
					Quadriceps.
					Quadriceps, but we call them quads. The guys that work out will always say, "Oh, nice quads, bro.
					Nice quads, bro. You got a good quad pump going, bro. Sick." These down here, guys, are your calves.
					The back of your leg is called your hamstrings. This not booty.
					No, I know. I know. Your I can't think of..<br>
					So, we would say your butt, your booty, but the actual name for the muscle is called glutius maximus
					or glutes.
					So, I think I covered everything, right, Wife?
					Yeah.
					Is there any other muscles? Well, abs..<br>
					The only other one I'll say, which you probably won't hear much, the sides of your abs have a
					different name. It's not part of the abs. They're called the obliques. But most people don't really
					like to work out their obliques too much because it makes you wider. And you don't want your stomach
					to be wider. It looks good when your stomach is more thin because when you have a thin stomach. If
					you're a man, your shoulders look bigger. If you're a woman, it makes your booty look bigger. Nobody
					wants to look like this. So men, when they go to the gym, they want this part to be wide and to go
					down like this, like a V. And women want the opposite. They want big down here and to go up like
					that. All right, guys. Those are the muscles..<br>
					Let's look around and see if there's anything else I could show you before we wrap up this video.
					And camera wife and I have a little fun in here cuz we still have this place for a little while. We
					rented it for 2 hours.
					These are called battle ropes.
					All right, camera wife's turn.
					What? So, one at a time.
					One at a time. Now, both at the time..<br>
					Keep going. Wow. Camera wife. Good job.
					All right, guys. Camera wife wants me to do this. This is a workout for your triceps. This is called
					uh let's see.
					They just call it try. What do they call it?
					You're like, what is what is how is this called?.<br>
					Push down. I think it's called a rope push down because you're using a rope.
					But anyway, this is a real good exercise for your triceps. 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 reps. So that was one
					set of 10 reps for my triceps. This machine actually feels really good..<br>
					Yeah.
					Yeah.
					How did these go?
					This is lat pull downs because you're working that part of your back, the lats. That feels really
					good. I'm getting a good pump in my back, bro..<br>
					Good back pump. That feels good. And some chest. Chest. I do it like this.
					These are called flies. Seated flies because I'm sitting. Those are flies. Or if you're just
					pressing, it's a chest press. I like the machines they have here.
					Yeah, these feel really good. Excuse me while I get a pump. Guys. Okay, guys.
					Something else I saw. I want to show you guys these. This is called box jumping.
					I don't know if you would call these jumping boxes or what, but it's really good to improve your
					jump. That's a cool verb. Jump. So, you jump..<br>
					That was too easy, though. So, you can make it taller. Make it taller.
					That's a pretty good jump. But I want to try the hard one.
					And see you move it a little bit back.
					Okay, guys. This is the hard box jump.
					Wife, do you think I could do it?
					That's a pretty high jump..<br>
					Hold on, wife.
					What?
					What do I win if I can do this?
					I don't know.
					You're not going to give me a prize?
					A prize? Um, okay. That's a high jump..<br>
					What?
					What do you think?
					I feel like Spider-Man.
					Okay. Something else about it.
					Nope. That's it for the box jump, guys.
					All right, guys. I think we're at the end of the video. And this video will probably be 25 to 30
					minutes, but we've been here recording for 2 hours, guys..<br>
					We did cardio. We did boxing. We did free weights. We did machines. We did jiu-jitsu. I'm tired,
					guys. I hope you enjoyed this video. Thank you. Thank you. I appreciate every single one of you guys
					for spending your time with me..<br>
					As the channel keeps growing, I hope to bring you guys cooler and cooler content like this. Really
					hope you enjoyed it..<br>
					That's it, guys. I got nothing else to give. See you in the next video.
