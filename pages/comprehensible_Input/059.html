					ok ini what are we going to talk about today? about our relationship, what we learned together.and
					what we have done together, ok what have we done together?
					I want to sit and talk about it, you want to sit and talk?
					what are we going to talk about today? all in English. tell me what we are going to talk about. we
					are going to talk about things that we have done together we are going to talk about what we've done
					together and what we learned from each other in our relationship. what have you learned from me?
					small things make the difference if you do them everyday, it can be something big in the future. wow
					how deep, you are welcome. I taught you that? wow I don't even know that!
					you didn't say you have to do that but I learned that from how you are. Yes my baby is like that
					something that has changed in me from being with you is I want to be a better person I want to be
					more kind and good, and show that I care. so we've done a lot of cool things in our relationship but
					first I want to talk about the day that we met. so before that, how did we find each other?
					why me?because I want to hear you practice your English, they know I speak English. ok so everything
					started when I was so bored, and so depressed its true, so someone told me about an app, she said I
					met a friend here, it was a dating app.i said I don't want to meet anybody because this is funny I
					don't know if I told you this, but before I came here everyone told me the men here are crazy and
					they just want to have fun so I said no, I don't want to meet anybody and im so different I don't
					want it. so finally I downloaded the app and there were so many men saying hi gorgeous and hi
					beautiful, and he just said Que linda on a picture I thought he said that because I look latina and
					he wants to pretend he speaks Spanish, but I didn't know he really speaks Spanish, hold on a second,
					I said que linda and she replied in English like hi how are you, pretending like she speaks English.
					so I replied in English a whole paragraph. and she didn't reply for a few hours so I replied in
					Spanish he said he speaks Spanish too, so I was like oh really this guy is interesting.then she
					replied. how difficult was it to talk for the first time? when we started talking I had no idea what
					WhatsApp is because in the U.S we don't use whatsapp, I don't have family in different countries so
					I don't use WhatsApp. she uses it because in other countries you guys use it. I didn't know what it
					was so we couldn't text each other in that time I didn't have phone service. I only had my phone
					with wifi.finally we used Skype I think. ya that was so hard, I almost said ok I don't want to talk.
					no don't lie Ini! Don't Lie!
					he said this is so hard but hard things are good. yeah I said I never had to try so hard to talk to
					a girl. yeah he said that, I thought hmmm im not sure about this. so we finally talked. I remember
					we said there's a lot of weird people out there so that's why we wanted to talk first, to show you
					that im normal. I said so what do you think am I normal? and I said yes! that's so funny what we
					said we talked about weird things. she was hear alone from another country so I wanted to show her
					im a normal guy, this is something you might not know, so he had information in his profile and he
					said he is a dad and I didn't read it, we were talking on the video call and he said something about
					his son, I said wait you have a son. he said yes its on my profile and I said I didn't read it its
					funny because I couldn't read it. yeah it was all in English. I didn't read it because I couldn't
					understand. so when he said he was a dad I was more comfortable like ok he has a son he's not crazy.
					yeah im not going to kidnap someone I take care of a kid. and then after we talked on video we
					decided we were going to meet each other it was like twenty days later because I couldn't go out I
					was trying to figure out how to get out of the jail. so I came and busted you out. you want to say
					about when you called the house and said yeah she was working for a crazy lady at that time the lady
					didn't want her to leave or have friends, she treated her like a slave.it was a bad situation, so I
					called and said I was her cousin coming to get her because I have a cousin in Chicago, this was the
					first time we met. I wore nice clothes because I thought she was beautiful so I wanted to make
					myself handsome so I wore a nice shirt , pants and shoes I never saw him again like that, she came
					out in sweat pants and a hoodie. out was crazy. I got in the car because I didn't want her to come
					outside and see him so I was like what is he wearing? I was so embarrassed because I never dress
					like that but it was cold, and I was here for 2 months and I didn't have enough nice clothes for
					cold weather. so we went to a park and talked about photography because she knows about cameras I
					just started my YouTube channel so I asked her to show me how to use my camera so she showed me and
					touched my hand. so you think that happened but I was trying to explain to you can you put your
					finger here and I touched your hand but not because I wanted to do it, one time, he thinks I was in
					love with him the first date but that's not true tell them what you said when the wind was in your
					hair, she was trying to show me her English she said "my hair crazy" I didn't say it like that! it
					was so cute so that first date Ini knew some words in English but not how to speak, you've come so
					far since then. so we spoke Spanish, our first date was four or five hours, and I never spoke
					Spanish for that long so I had done lessons for like an hour but that was the longest I ever spoke
					in Spanish, how was that? it was awesome that's why my Spanish got so much better with her. well you
					are welcome my English too. so we were taking pictures at the park I said you have to be my model. I
					was so embarrassed and shy. so I took pictures with my camera, I showed all of my friends like look
					at this cute girl look at her smile, her teeth, her hair I was showing her off because I was happy
					we went and ate sushi and drank wine, she drank half a glass and was like. I never drink, she
					doesn't drink, she's a good girl. I never went with someone I didn't know and talk about such deep
					things, about life, it was fun something I had so much fun because it was my first time was sledding
					that was so fun in the snow. Probably the people on my channel haven't been sledding. maybe in the
					mountains in Mexico that was really fun, me her and my son went sledding what did you think about
					that?
					it was so fun also its funny because you have to use so many clothes, she didn't have a snow suit so
					she wore her pants and my pants and her hoodie and my hoodie, and my gloves and you looked so cute I
					have a picture with snow all over your face and you have the biggest smile.i was happy in that
					photo. oh the mud run. we did a race where run and it was 3 miles and there's obstacles with
					watering mud and it was cool it was a test for her. I wanted to see if she could be my girlfriend.
					and I grew up on a farm!can you believe it?she was milking cows and stuff but I wanted to see if she
					could run and get dirty because I know in the future I will have adventures and I want to know that
					my girl can come with me, well I want! and I learned that she can she got mud all over her and she
					ran I was so proud. and at the end he said now you can be my Girlfriend and I was like oh really I
					thought I was your girlfriend. ok so how did that happen how did we become boyfriend and Girlfriend,
					that was funny. we went to dinner, then went to book store. on this day im not sure if he thought I
					was his Girlfriend or just his friend
