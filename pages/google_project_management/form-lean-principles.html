					principles
					that serve as a recipe for improving project outcomes.<br />They are define value, map value stream,
					create flow, establish pull, and pursue perfection.<br />Let’s break these down.<br />Define value
					means
					identifying and focusing on what the customer wants and including the customer in the
					process.<br />A
					product’s value is the sum of all the things the customer wants.<br />Map value stream means mapping
					out
					the process or stream, including all the steps involved in producing value for the customer.<br />It
					also means challenging any steps that can be considered wasteful or unnecessary.<br />Create flow
					means
					ensuring the product flows through the value stream efficiently, continuing to eliminate waste
					throughout the cycle.<br />Work to remove interruptions, delays, and barriers to the work
					stream.<br />Establish pull.<br />Think of asking someone to pull something off the shelf.<br />You
					want
					to make sure the customer is pulling on the product, or asking for it, throughout the value
					stream.<br />They might pull or ask for features in incremental deliveries.<br />The idea is to make
					your process as smooth as possible so that the customer can pull on the product at any time, and
					you’ll
					be able to present what you’ve been working on or add a feature request.<br />Finally, there’s
					pursue
					perfection.<br />This means pushing your team to continuously improve the first four process
					steps.<br />So how does this relate to Agile?<br />Well, Agile emerged after Lean, and the inventors
					of
					Agile were inspired to apply Lean manufacturing principles to software development.<br />Like Agile,
					Lean is a set of principles and a value system.<br />Many of the differences are really just in the
					wording.<br /></p>
