					within
					organizations and settings with different cultures, business objectives, and industry
					dynamics.<br />In
					this video, we’ll discuss some different scenarios in which you’d want to adopt an Agile
					mindset.<br />I’ll also introduce you to a concept called VUCA that can help you decide which
					management
					approach is best for your project.<br />Remember, Agile is about delivering value in a world with
					high
					degrees of uncertainty, risk, and competition.<br />It sets a team up to react as quickly as
					possible to
					new information, new market opportunities, and even new technologies.<br />Agile works best in
					industries or projects that are susceptible to or that encourage change and uncertainty.<br />What
					kinds
					of businesses or industries, besides software, come to mind that deal with lots of change?<br />A
					few
					that I think of are biotechnology, with emerging vaccines, treatments, and technologies.<br />Media,
					with endless new ways to share content.<br />The food industry, with celebrity chefs and the latest
					food
					craze.<br />And fashion, an industry built on keeping up with shifting trends.<br />Did any of these
					surprise you?<br />On the flip side, here are some industries that you might think of as fairly
					stable–
					agriculture, aerospace, manufacturing, and mining.<br />But even these industries, with rigorous
					supply
					chains and codes, have to adapt to change due to new laws and regulations, natural disasters, and
					other
					unforeseen issues.<br />One thing that the year 2020 taught all of us is that no industry is truly
					immune to change and uncertainty.<br />We’re going to explore a concept for categorizing and
					thinking
					about these forces that shape our world, no matter what industry we’re in.<br />That concept is
					called
					VUCA, and it can help you decide which project management approach is best for you.<br />The US
					Military
					War College developed a concept called VUCA, spelled V-U-C-A.<br />VUCA is an acronym that defines
					the
					conditions that affect organizations in a changing and complex world.<br />It was designed to help
					us
					factor in the forces of change and uncertainty in our projects and businesses.<br />VUCA stands for
					volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity.<br />I’ll explain each one and what that could
					entail in projects and business settings.<br />First up is volatility.<br />Volatility refers to the
					rate of change and churn in a business or situation.<br />In a volatile project, you would discuss
					how
					the next disruption to your operations is always right around the corner, or it feels like things
					never
					have time to settle into a normal rhythm.<br />Next is uncertainty.<br />Uncertainty refers to the
					lack
					of predictability or high potential for surprise.<br />In an uncertain environment, it would be
					difficult to create plans for the future that were not based on a large number of assumptions that
					could
					turn out to be incorrect.<br />Then there’s complexity.<br />Complexity refers to the high number of
					interrelated forces, issues, organizations, and factors that would influence the project.<br />For
					example, if one product being worked on relied on diverse and global suppliers, that would add to
					the
					complexity of the project.<br />And finally, we have ambiguity.<br />Ambiguity refers to the
					possibility
					of misunderstanding the conditions and root causes of events or circumstances.<br />A project that
					suffered from ambiguity would have difficulty pinpointing the causes of project delays, making it
					difficult to design mitigation plans to reduce the risks.<br />Let’s recap.<br />VUCA stands for
					volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity.<br />It’s a concept that was developed to deal
					with
					these forces in a changing and uncertain world.<br />Businesses can apply the concept of VUCA as a
					tool
					for determining how best to approach projects.<br />Phew.<br />That’s a lot of info, but it’s all
					good
					stuff.<br />Having an understanding of these concepts will help with decision making in all kinds of
					projects.<br />Adopting an Agile approach increases your chances of success despite this
					uncertainty.<br />And these concepts apply to the business world at large, not just projects.<br />
