				<p id="1cf468a0-53d4-8137-b00a-c00b32525c4a" class="">SPEAKER: By now, you should be aware that
					effective
					team communication is necessary to help ensure a successful project outcome.<br />In this video,
					I’ll
					share more tips for communicating with your team and introduce you to tools that will help you and
					your
					team communicate even more effectively.<br />As the project manager, you are the one who connects
					your
					team to the information they need.<br />Throughout the project, you’ll serve as the main resource
					for
					your team when it comes to communicating and clarifying goals, action items, progress, and
					updates.<br />It’s important to make sure that you’re carrying information forward consistently and
					coherently so that everyone understands what the current state of the project is and what happens
					next.<br />Teams communicate in a myriad of ways.<br />Though project managers are constantly
					communicating through check-ins and meetings, project documents, such as project plans, including
					schedules, trackers, or meeting notes, they’re also hubs for team communication.<br />It’s your
					responsibility to be clear about how those documents get used, who has access to those documents,
					and
					how often the documents get updated.<br />Of course, in addition to those responsibilities, you’ll
					also
					have to field emails, instant messages, and attend meetings.<br />All of these things are critical
					in
					driving a project forward.<br />As a project manager, you are the one who coordinates incoming and
					outgoing information.<br />You connect individuals to the necessary details and context and track
					who
					needs to receive what information and when.<br />You’ll need to communicate certain information to
					your
					team multiple times and in various ways.<br />Some people learn by listening.<br />Some people learn
					by
					watching.<br />And others learn by doing.<br />Communicating in various ways ensures that you’re
					sharing
					knowledge to your team in a format that’s digestible and easy for them to take in.<br />Your team
					will
					have a lot of tasks to focus on.<br />Be proactive and reinforce important information multiple
					times in
					multiple ways so that no one is left out of the loop.<br />There are many tools for communicating
					with
					your team to make it easy to keep in contact and be on the same page throughout the duration of the
					project.<br />Some of these include email and messaging, in person meetings, video conferencing, and
					work management and collaboration tools.<br />Your organization might have some of these tools in
					place
					already or you might have the opportunity to select some for a project.<br />In either case, it’s
					good
					to be familiar with what’s out there.<br />Let’s explore some of the common tools for effectively
					communicating with your project team and stakeholders.<br />In this video, we’ll focus on messaging,
					virtual meetings, and work management and collaboration tools.<br />Let’s start with messaging and
					email.<br />Email is standard for business communications so it’s important to streamline the number
					of
					emails that you send out.<br />At Google, I get tons of emails a day.<br />It’s a lot of work to
					figure
					out which ones I need to read immediately, which ones can wait, and which ones require a reply right
					away.<br />It’s important that you understand how to use email in a professional context.<br />A
					quick
					internet search will provide you with lots of tips and examples.<br />Here are some of my key tips
					for
					you to keep in mind.<br />Carefully select who you’re sending an email to.<br />And most
					importantly, be
					conscious of why you’re sending it.<br />Make sure the subject field clearly states what the email
					is
					about.<br />If it’s urgent or requires a response, add that to the subject and the first line of the
					email.<br />Keep your messages as short as possible and stay on topic.<br />If there’s a lot of
					information to share, consider placing the information into a digital document you can link or
					attach to
					the email.<br />Then summarize what you want readers to focus on.<br />If there’s a specific action
					you
					need from the recipient, state it clearly so that they understand what’s expected of them and
					when.<br />Your language choices matter so avoid slang acronyms, and shortcuts for words that might
					be
					more appropriate for texts.<br />Oh, and one more thing.<br />Write in an appropriate tone for the
					person receiving the email.<br />It’s generally best practice to be friendly, motivating, clear, and
					specific.<br />As I mentioned earlier, most people, especially other managers, directors, and
					executives, get lots of emails.<br />With that in mind, you may want to consider instant messaging
					tools
					like Google Meet or Slack.<br />This can be an alternative to email when you just have a quick
					question
					or update or as a way to alert someone to please check their inbox.<br />Instant messaging helps
					reduce
					back and forth emails or phone calls and can quickly clear up miscommunications or let you know if
					and
					when you should take an issue to a meeting.<br />Be mindful of when you decide to use instant
					messaging.<br />This kind of quick communication can lead to distraction and informality.<br />It
					can
					easily become an outlet to share non-work related information or information that’s sensitive or
					confidential.<br />It can also be difficult to track instant messages.<br />Later on, if you need to
					reference information that you chatted about, you might not be able to easily find it with instant
					messaging.<br />It’s a good idea to ask people’s preferences on how they’d like to be communicated
					with.<br />Even if instant messaging is faster, the person might prefer to use email.<br />With
					experience, you’ll be able to determine the most effective ways to communicate with your
					team.<br />Next
					up, we’ll discuss some tools for remote meetings.<br />Virtual meeting tools like Google Meet and
					Zoom
					are great for communicating, especially as remote work becomes more standard.<br />Better yet, each
					of
					these tools are easy to access and easy to learn how to use.<br />Well run, online meetings can be
					extremely effective.<br />They allow you and your team to interact in real time, which can help
					boost
					morale and create a sense of team when it’s not possible to be together in person.<br />Virtual
					meetings
					can be highly engaging as attendees can access and share files during the meeting.<br />And then
					there
					are work management and collaboration tools like Google Drive, Asana, and Smartsheet.<br />These
					kinds
					of tools make it easier to share information among teams.<br />Even better, with work management and
					collaboration tools, information sharing goes both ways.<br />Team members can easily update their
					progress without the need for extra meetings or phone calls.<br />These tools can accomplish many
					different things like tracking progress on tasks, deliverables, and milestones.<br />They can also
					help
					you to manage a budget, build helpful charts and diagrams, manage contracts and licenses, and keep
					stakeholders informed.<br />Work management and collaboration tools allow you to focus your
					communications within the context of specific tasks, project details, and timelines.<br />Rather
					than
					writing an email and linking to the relevant information, when you’re working and communicating in a
					tool, the information is already there in one place for easy reference and decision
					making.<br />Another
					great aspect of these kinds of tools is that the work gets done in real time.<br />These tools allow
					remote teams to collaborate and communicate as though they’re physically working in the same office
					together.<br />Encouraging your teams to check in and update their progress regularly helps to
					maintain
					the real time feel of interacting with coworkers.<br />There are many different types of work
					management
					software that automatically make project planning and tracking a lot easier.<br />And they are much
					more
					efficient than manual project tracking.<br />A quick word of caution before we move on.<br />The
					use,
					access, or sharing of confidential or need to know information externally, including financial and
					business data, user data, and information about our products and services, is likely prohibited
					unless
					you’re given explicit permission.<br />When using shared work management tools, just be mindful of
					who
					wants and needs access versus who doesn’t need access to do your part in keeping important data
					safe.<br />There are so many different ways to share information to your team, whether through
					meetings,
					emails, instant messages, spreadsheets, and trackers.<br />By becoming familiar with some of the
					more
					common communication tools, you can choose the right one for your project needs.<br />Meetings can
					be an
					effective method to distribute information, communicate with your team and stakeholders, and help
					keep a
					project on track.<br />In this video, you’ll learn how to organize and facilitate effective team
					meetings that will lead to a successful project.<br />While the size, purpose, and format of
					meetings
					may differ, effective meetings always have the following elements in common.<br />They are
					structured,
					intentional, collaborative, and inclusive.<br />Let’s study these elements in more
					detail.<br />First,
					effective meetings are structured.<br />This means they start and end on time, the attendees have
					been
					carefully selected, the meeting topics are prioritized, and the designated note taker has been
					assigned.<br />Managing the meeting time and audience lets participants know that they’re valued and
					appreciated.<br />Remember that everyone’s time is valuable.<br />If someone’s presence is
					unnecessary,
					you don’t need to invite them to the meeting.<br />Maybe you can share the notes.<br />Include
					people
					who can contribute to the discussion and anyone who will be directly affected by the topics
					discussed.<br />Structured meetings also have an agenda with prioritized topics so the most
					important
					items are given appropriate attention.<br />It’s good to think about and set expectations for how
					long
					you expect the group to spend on a given topic.<br />This is defined as time boxing, which just
					means
					you’re setting a time limit for discussion.<br />In a time box, you give each topic a buffer of a
					few
					minutes to make sure you’re not over packing your agenda.<br />Keep the meeting time in mind and
					make
					sure you schedule enough time for the topic you need to cover.<br />If there are several topics you
					need
					to address, consider scheduling a few shorter meetings with just one or two topics as their
					focus.<br />After your first few team meetings, think about the pacing to know if you need to be
					more
					generous with the time given to each topic or if the group has time for a little more.<br />If you
					get
					through your topics before your time is up, don’t be afraid to call a meeting early.<br />Everybody
					loves having their time back.<br />Finally, a structured meeting should have a designated note taker
					so
					you or anyone else can refer to the meeting notes later and find out what was discussed.<br />The
					note
					taker could be you or another meeting attendee.<br />For this reason, be clear about how, when, and
					to
					whom the meeting’s outcomes are shared.<br />Again, this all depends on the type of meeting you’re
					having and who is attending.<br />I’ll loop back to describe some different types of project
					meetings in
					the next video.<br />The next point to consider is that effective meetings are also
					intentional.<br />This means they have a clearly stated purpose and expectations, which should be in
					the
					meeting agenda as well as the meeting invite so everyone understands why they’re attending.<br />The
					agenda needs to set clear expectations for what needs to occur before and during a meeting.<br />It
					helps attendees prepare, keeps everyone focused on the right topics, and clarifies meeting
					expectations
					and goals.<br />The purpose of your meeting might be to make a decision, assign tasks,
					propose/invent an
					idea, or something else.<br />Your meeting’s purpose or goal describes the reason you’re meeting and
					what you’d like to achieve.<br />A well designed agenda increases the group’s ability to address
					problems and prevents wasting time.<br />For example, you may be reviewing last month’s business
					sales
					and setting goals for the next month.<br />Maybe your group needs to choose coordinators for an
					upcoming
					event.<br />Or your goal could be to have your supervisor prioritize a list of tasks.<br />The
					purpose
					might change from meeting to meeting or it could say the same.<br />If input is needed by attendees,
					be
					sure to send any prereading materials in advance of the meeting so that everyone shows up prepared
					to
					participate.<br />Depending on the purpose, meetings can be formal or informal, have as few as two
					or
					three group members, or have hundreds of attendees.<br />Whatever it is, make sure you state a clear
					thoughtful purpose and strive to achieve that purpose by the end of the allotted time.<br />Another
					element of effective meetings is encouraging a collaborative environment.<br />Collaboration is when
					people work together to produce or create something.<br />There are lots of ways to make your
					meetings
					collaborative, even if the purpose is for one person to share important information with the rest of
					the
					group.<br />One easy way to do this is to be sure the agenda isn’t just full of presentations where
					participants are talked at.<br />Be sure the agenda is clear about the objectives of the
					session.<br />Will a decision be made or is the session for information and discussion?<br />Second,
					have a digital shared meeting document and encourage participants to write any comments or thoughts
					directly in the document.<br />But more importantly, remind them that the notes will be
					shared.<br />This encourages active listening and participation in real time during the
					meeting.<br />Last, it’s important to respect and embrace each individual’s preferred communication
					style, even in meetings, especially in collaborative meetings.<br />Let folks know they’re welcome
					to
					respond verbally, through the chat, in the meeting notes, or in any other format you’d like to
					include.<br />The final element of an effective meeting is that it’s inclusive.<br />Inclusivity is
					the
					practice or policy of including people who might otherwise be excluded or marginalized.<br />When
					it’s
					done well, inclusion leads to excellent collaboration, ensuring that every participant’s
					contributions
					are valued.<br />As a project manager, you play a critical role in ensuring that meeting attendees
					feel
					supported and included, so offering additional resources for ways to participate is
					helpful.<br />For
					both in-person and virtual meetings, consider appointing a meeting moderator or
					facilitator.<br />This
					person will guide the meeting and help participants ask questions in real time while someone else is
					presenting.<br />This way the presenter can stay focused on their topic while the moderator pays
					attention to the participants and can help guide participants on when they can chime in.<br />It’s
					also
					a good idea to leave space in the meeting for participants who’ve been quiet.<br />At the close of a
					topic or before the meeting ends, you might consider going around the room once in a while and
					asking
					each person to comment on a particular issue or question.<br />I like to call this a final flight
					check
					before everyone takes off and goes their separate ways.<br />A key component of inclusivity is
					ensuring
					that your meetings and presentations are accessible.<br />You’ll find more information on this in
					the
					course resources.<br />Another thing to consider is the level of internet access when conducting
					virtual
					meetings.<br />For those without strong internet access, provide a phone dial-in option.<br />Most
					online meeting tools, including Google Meet and Zoom, have this option.<br />Let participants know
					it’s
					OK to turn off their cameras if they need to improve the connection or just the video
					quality.<br />Focusing on inclusion helps build a sense of belonging and serves as a reminder that
					we
					live in a world with many different kinds of people.<br />Creating a meeting space where people of
					different views, backgrounds, and experiences can do their best work and be there for one another is
					key.<br />These tips aren’t exhaustive by any means but hopefully they can be useful to start
					empowering
					others to meaningfully join in and contribute.<br />When done right, meetings can be incredibly
					useful
					communication tools.<br />That’s why it’s important to be purposeful when designing meetings that
					are
					structured, intentional, collaborative, and inclusive.<br />This will earn you a reputation for
					running
					efficient, inclusive, successful meetings where everyone feels appreciated, which is great for your
					project and your career.<br />Now that you’ve learned the key components for organizing and
					facilitating
					an effective team meeting, we’ll explore the specifics of some of the most common types of meetings
					you’ll need to have during a project.<br />Every project has meetings.<br />Lots of
					meetings.<br />While
					every meeting is unique, being familiar with the most common types of project management meetings
					will
					help you better identify the goals, structure, and activities best suited for each one.<br />There
					are
					four general types of project management meetings– project kickoff, status updates, stakeholder
					reviews,
					and project reviews.<br />The first one we’ll talk about is the project kickoff meeting.<br />This
					is
					often considered the official beginning of a project and serves as a way to align the team’s
					understanding of the project goals with actual plans and procedures.<br />Members of your team are
					the
					major attendees of your kickoff meeting, but the participation of senior management and key
					stakeholders
					is also required for securing buy-in and ensuring alignment with project goals.<br />The next type
					of
					meeting we’ll discuss are status update meetings.<br />Status update meetings are one of the most
					common
					types of meetings.<br />This category includes regular team meetings where the primary goal is to
					align
					the team on updates, progress, challenges, and next steps.<br />During the meeting, the project
					manager
					may distribute or present project performance reports and formal status updates on key elements of
					the
					project.<br />This allows the team and stakeholders to gain visibility into current performance
					levels
					and task progress.<br />One of the project manager’s key responsibilities is to be aware of the
					status
					of the project at any given time and to ensure that others are up to speed or know where to find the
					latest information.<br />In order to do that, status updates become a critical tool throughout the
					lifecycle of a project to check in on the project.<br />Typically, you’ll assess the status of each
					of
					the following topics during this meeting.<br />First are task updates.<br />It is important for the
					attendees to know what is the status of the most urgent tasks, how many tasks have been completed,
					and
					how many open items remain.<br />Next is schedule status.<br />Are we behind schedule, ahead of
					schedule, or on pace with our projections?<br />Similarly, it’s common to discuss the budget status
					and
					any new items that impact your bottom line.<br />Then you should discuss current or anticipated
					issues.<br />For example, changes, risks, resource issues, vendor issues, and so on, particularly
					changes to quality and scope.<br />It’s always a good idea to raise these items on a recurring basis
					so
					that no one is caught off guard and you can discuss solutions together.<br />Lastly, you’ll want to
					discuss action items.<br />An action item is a task on your list that needs to be
					completed.<br />Assigning action items is a great way to wrap up the meeting and make sure the
					project
					keeps forging ahead.<br />Remember every action item has an owner and a due date.<br />The status
					meeting is a fundamental project tool that keeps the project on track.<br />Most project managers
					recommend using a relatively fixed agenda and time with this meeting.<br />To keep the team engaged,
					follow the agenda and hold the meeting to a tight schedule.<br />Because the project manager should
					be
					able to report up to date information to the project sponsors or clients at any time, it’s important
					to
					conduct status meetings regularly.<br />Status meetings are beneficial because they provide an
					opportunity for recognizing milestones, sharing information, and raising concerns to the
					team.<br />How
					often you decide to schedule these meetings depends on several factors, such as the project’s
					complexity, number of team members, and the level of information required by the project sponsor,
					clients, or others.<br />Don’t be afraid to change up the cadence as your project
					progresses.<br />Another type of project management meeting is a stakeholder
					meeting.<br />Stakeholder
					engagement is essential for successful project management.<br />The goal of a stakeholder meeting is
					to
					get buy-in and support.<br />Stakeholders each have their own set of tools, know how, and
					expertise.<br />Stakeholder meetings are where these contributions are outlined and
					utilized.<br />You’ll need to start by understanding a stakeholder’s challenges or problems, then
					respond accordingly and make necessary adjustments to resolve those challenges.<br />Winning and
					sustaining the support of your stakeholders is important to your project’s success.<br />In some
					cases,
					you might want to have stakeholder meetings on a one on one basis.<br />This allows you to dive
					deeper
					on relevant details with each stakeholder.<br />Then you can cover the topics that are most
					interesting
					and concerning to that particular person.<br />Other times you’ll need to engage stakeholders in
					groups.<br />If you have a large number of stakeholders to manage, focus the meeting on your
					project’s
					most influential stakeholders.<br />Identify appropriate stakeholders for high touch
					communication.<br />For example, you may focus the meeting on senior managers from each of the
					groups
					you need to engage.<br />Other stakeholders can be informed using other methods such as email or
					meeting
					notes.<br />While there are a number of potential topics to cover when meeting with stakeholders,
					most
					meetings are limited to communicating critical information.<br />You should always be able to
					present a
					project update.<br />Start the meeting with a short overall project status update of two to five
					minutes.<br />Another key reason to meet with stakeholders is to seek out and listen to feedback, or
					you
					might meet with stakeholders to make a decision or resolve a major issue surrounding your
					project.<br />In this case, you’ll often meet with senior leaders and the project
					sponsor.<br />Decisions could include go or no go decisions, a choice between options or signing off
					on
					investments.<br />Stakeholder meetings are generally more formal.<br />It’s normal to prepare
					reading
					materials and documents to review ahead of time to help get people in the right mindset for the
					meeting.<br />Stakeholder meetings can be regular and recurring or just a one off project
					meeting.<br />The frequency will depend on why the stakeholder is involved in the project.<br />Are
					they
					playing an advisory role, such as a consultant in a RACI, or just someone to inform and keep in the
					loop?<br />Does their involvement center around just one activity on the project or do they need to
					stay
					involved on a longer term basis?<br />You’ll need to decide on a case by case basis.<br />The end of
					the
					project or the end of the project phase is an excellent opportunity to review how the project
					unfolded.<br />This is called a retrospective.<br />And you’ll learn more about this in other
					sections
					of this course.<br />A typical retrospective meeting agenda includes reviewing lessons learned about
					what’s going well, what you should keep doing, and what can be improved.<br />Equally important to
					reviewing lessons learned is taking the opportunity to celebrate the project success.<br />Knowing
					the
					difference between these project meeting types allows you to maximize productivity and ensure that
					you’re not wasting time.<br />You’ll get the right outcome from each type of meeting, which will
					help
					drive decisions and lead to proactive, positive actions.<br />ROWENA: Congratulations on finishing
