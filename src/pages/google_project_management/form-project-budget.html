				<p id="1cf468a0-53d4-8153-b71f-d5a529bdbc45" class="">Let’s get back to budgeting.<br />You may already
					set
					a budget to help you stay on track with your monthly expenses in your personal life.<br />Many
					people do
					because it allows them to feel prepared and in control of their finances.<br />The same is true
					about
					project budgeting.<br />Project budgeting is a little more complex than your personal
					budget.<br />We’ll
					help you understand and go a little deeper into what a project budget entails.<br />A project budget
					is
					the estimated monetary resources needed to achieve the project’s goals and objectives.<br />When
					reviewing a project budget, you need to consider all of the potential and projected costs needed to
					complete the project.<br />You break the budget down by milestones, which are important points
					within
					the project schedule that indicate progress and usually signifies the completion of a deliverable or
					phase of the project, and list activities and tasks alongside their associated costs.<br />This
					ensures
					that you calculate the correct expenses for a particular period of time.<br />This is considered a
					forecast.<br />A forecast for your project budget is a cost estimate or a prediction over a period
					of
					time.<br />You’ll frequently review your project budget, and it will evolve throughout the project
					life
					cycle.<br />These budgets usually contain items such as labor, operating costs, and costs associated
					with obtaining necessary materials like hardware, software, or equipment.<br />The importance of a
					project budget focuses on more than just saving money.<br />In project management, a budget is
					considered a deliverable.<br />It is a success metric.<br />The project budget is a tool to
					communicate
					exactly what is needed and when it is needed with stakeholders.<br />The budget will have a direct
					effect on the company’s financial viability, so, as you can probably tell by now, it’s an integral
					part
					of project management.<br />Budget creation takes place in the initiation phase of your
					project.<br />Keep in mind that the budget will be adjusted as needed throughout the lifecycle of
					the
					project.<br />Depending on your role in a company, you won’t always be the sole creator of the
					budget.<br />Your ownership over things like budget and vendor relationship may vary depending on
					factors such as size of the company or support team or the team organizational chart.<br />Although
					you
					may not always manage the budget from start to finish, budget and milestones go hand in hand, so
					it’s
					important for you to know the ins and outs of the budget throughout the project.<br />As a project
					manager, you may be tasked with obtaining approvals for spending.<br />Most companies have a signing
					or
					spending policy.<br />This usually outlines who has the authority to commit resources or incur costs
					or
					other obligations on behalf of the company.<br />This is important because you won’t be able to
					continue
					with some of your deliverables or action items if you don’t know how much certain activities will
					cost
					and whether you have the necessary funds available.<br />It wouldn’t make any sense to rent a
					property
					without checking on the rental cost first, right?<br />That’s especially true if the rental price is
					higher than your budget.<br />The same thinking is applicable for your project budgeting.<br />The
					budgeting process usually happens in conjunction with the scheduling process because the steps of
					the
					scheduling process are highly dependent on the costs.<br />The project manager will collaborate with
					people on the project to create their estimations.<br />For the most part, after the cost estimating
					process has been completed, it’s common for the project sponsor or another key stakeholder to review
					and
					approve estimation costs and, if necessary, adjust and reallocate funds for the project.<br />This
					could
					mean that either the CEO or the COO are the ones giving the OK or the final sign-off.<br />For
					example,
					in our Office Green project, the director of product has sign-off approval.<br />As we mentioned
					before,
					the project manager will most likely need some kind of sign-off from the finance
					department.<br />This
					may vary from company to company, so just make sure you’re aware of your company’s
					processes.<br />Project budgeting is never a one-size-fits-all operation.<br />As the project
					manager,
					you’ll have to prioritize where you allocate funds within the project to ensure maximum
					output.<br />Ultimately, most projects are created to improve workforce productivity, increase
					revenue,
					or attempt to save costs within an organization.<br />Budgeting is one of the most important aspects
					of
					project management.<br />And when you start, to stay on budget is one of the trickiest
					tasks.<br />It’s
					important not to go over budget and cost the company extra money.<br />And it’s equally important
					not to
					be under budget either, since that might affect the company’s budget for the next year.<br />When it
					comes to high-profile businesses, such as publicly traded companies, like Google, or public sector
					organizations, such as your local education department, they may have a requirement to report on
					their
					financial performance to shareholders or auditors.<br />Going too far over or under budget will
					change
					the way the company budgets for the next year, potentially leaving you with less money to work with
					in
					the future.<br />In other words, a project manager must show the requested amount of money was used
					in
					order to secure enough budget for future projects.<br />For smaller businesses, there may be a
					tighter
					budget, in which case it’s especially critical to be careful about spending too much money on a
					project
					than initially allocated.<br />It’s really helpful to your overall success as a project manager to
					understand budgeting.<br />So in the next video, we’re going to learn the specific ins and outs of
					what’s included in a budget.<br />[MUSIC PLAYING] Now that you have an understanding of what a
					budget
					is, let’s discuss some specific components in a budget.<br />There are so many things to factor into
					project budgeting.<br />Unfortunately, it’s not quite as simple as a company saying, we have $5,000,
					so
					that’s our budget.<br />When you go to the grocery store, in the same way that you don’t determine
					how
					much apples will cost, businesses can’t just decide that they want to spend $200 on a project if the
					market rate for a project of the same caliber is $2,000.<br />Instead, project managers must account
					for
					understanding stakeholder needs, budgeting for surplus expenses, maintaining adaptability, and
					reviewing
					and reforecasting throughout the entire project.<br />And these are only some examples of what
					you’ll
					need to take into account.<br />Let’s imagine some of these factors in our Office Green
					project.<br />In
					terms of understanding stakeholder needs, it’s important to know exactly what stakeholders expect
					from
					this project in order to deliver.<br />As a company, the ultimate goal is typically to make a profit
					and
					to save money and time.<br />So the project sponsor, the director of product in this case, needs the
					project to come in at a certain cost in order to make profit.<br />As the project manager, you will
					also
					need to budget for surprise expenses.<br />Let’s say several planters arrive from the vendor broken
					and
					cracked.<br />Maybe the planters cracked during delivery process, and it isn’t the vendor’s fault.
					In
					that case, you’ll have to order some additional planters to fulfill orders, and that may be an added
					cost.<br />As your project continues along, you’ll have to review your budget and sometimes
					reforecast,
					which means creating a separate, revised budget based on how your project is tracking.<br />Keeping
					on
					top of the budget will help you stay organized.<br />And reforecasting is a way to recalibrate the
					budget if necessary.<br />As the project manager at Office Green, you might find that you need to
					shift
					costs to different resources and categories within your project budget.<br />Maybe you initially
					overestimated the cost of plants from the vendor and underestimated the costs of marketing your new
					launch.<br />So you can reallocate these dollars as necessary.<br />That’s a great example of how to
					review and reforecast.<br />There are several factors to consider when creating a budget, including
					resource cost rates, reserve analysis, contingency budget, and cost of quality.<br />You’ll need to
					determine resource cost rates.<br />Resource cost rates are exactly what they sound like– the cost
					of a
					resource.<br />Some examples of resources are labor, tools, equipment, materials, and
					software.<br />So
					you’ll want to ask yourself, how much will each of these resources cost the company?<br />Sometimes
					a
					project can be derailed because the project manager didn’t adequately include funds for reserves or
					buffers.<br />Performing a reserve analysis will help you account for any buffer funds you may
					need.<br />A reserve analysis is a method to check for remaining project resources.<br />In
					performing a
					reserve analysis, you’ll review all potential risks to your project and determine if you need to add
					buffer funds.<br />These funds are necessary because new costs that you didn’t originally foresee
					will
					arise.<br />This is also known as contingency budget.<br />Contingency budget, in the context of
					project
					management, is money that is included to cover potentially unforeseen events that aren’t accounted
					for
					in a cost estimate.<br />The purpose is to compensate for the uncertainty that occurs in cost and
					time
					estimates, as well as unpredictable risk exposure.<br />The cost of quality refers to all of the
					costs
					that are incurred to prevent issues with products, processes, or tasks.<br />The cost of quality
					includes prevention costs, appraisal costs, internal failure costs, and external failure
					costs.<br />Once you’ve applied these factors– resource cost rates, reserve analysis, contingency
					budget, and the cost of quality– into your budget, you can estimate what your project might
					cost.<br />Remember, your budget will most likely change.<br />Starting with an initial estimate is
					one
					way to ensure that you are at least on track.<br />And it’s OK if your budget does
					change.<br />That’s
					why we review and reforecast.<br />Hopefully, you’re starting to notice the framework for creating a
					budget.<br />In the next lesson, we’ll begin to piece a budget together.<br />Let’s put all of your
					notes and newly acquired knowledge to use.<br />See you soon.<br />[MUSIC PLAYING] Now that we’ve
					learned about budgeting, let’s find out how it all works together.<br />By now, we know that project
					budgets help to control costs throughout the duration of the project.<br />They help project
					managers
					establish the main objectives of their project and keep them within a reasonable framework to ensure
					that project makes financial sense for the company.<br />So what’s the best way to start making a
					project budget?<br />You’ll find that as you get further along in the process, there are various
					resources and tactics that you can use to make sure you aren’t overestimating or
					underestimating.<br />You’ll use techniques like researching historical data, leveraging experts,
					the
					bottom-up approach, confirming accuracy, and setting your baseline.<br />For starters, you can
					always
					review past projects that are similar to yours to get an idea of what your project could
					entail.<br />We’ll refer to that as referring to historical data.<br />This way, you can find out
					what
					past project managers did right and wrong.<br />The more experienced you become as a project
					manager,
					the more historical data you’ll have to draw upon and the better your estimations will be.<br />In a
					similar vein, you can leverage experts in the field.<br />To leverage something means to use it to
					its
					maximum advantage, so leveraging experts means gathering their insights to do something more
					effectively.<br />Reaching out to colleagues who worked on a similar project in the past will be a
					great
					resource for you as an entry-level project manager.<br />If you’re asking someone outside of your
					company for advice, be sure to avoid sharing any confidential company information with
					them.<br />Another approach to take is the bottom-up approach.<br />This means thinking about all
					the
					parts of a project from the beginning to the end, including making a list of every material,
					resource,
					contract worker, or anything that comes with an associated cost, and adding all of that
					together.<br />You should also ask the vendors you’re thinking of working with for quotes so you can
					get
					a rough estimate of how much their work will cost.<br />After you’ve created your budget with these
					resources, you’ll want to double-check everything to confirm accuracy.<br />Of course, the work
					doesn’t
					stop once you’ve created the budget.<br />Next, you have to set the baseline.<br />Your baseline is
					the
					dollar amount that you’ll use to measure against to find out if you’re on track or not and to
					measure
					the success of your project.<br />Once you’ve set your baseline, you’ll have to revisit that number
					and
					adjust it to match where the project is currently.<br />Making adjustments in real time is something
					you
					have to do a lot as a project manager.<br />The size of the project and company will determine how
					often
					you should re-examine and update the budget.<br />Creating a thorough budget is important to the
					success
					of your project.<br />With Project Plant Pals, we suggest breaking the project down into
					tasks.<br />That’s the bottom-up approach.<br />From there, we estimate the cost of each item, add
					those
					estimates together, add contingency and tax, and seek overall approval on our budget from our key
					stakeholders.<br />Since we’re creating a new service, we’ll need to hire designers and developers
					to
					build out the website and develop the app for our customers.<br />Once these tasks are laid out,
					you’ll
					have to negotiate employee allocations, contractor rates, and shop around for vendors and delivery
					services.<br />This will help you assign cost estimates to each task.<br />Now that the tasks have
					been
					broken down and assigned, you’ll need to account for material costs.<br />Do your team members and
					stakeholders need equipment?<br />Maybe an employee with a disability requires modifications to
					accommodate or enhance their workplace.<br />Maybe some remote workers need the hardware and
					accessories
					necessary to work from home.<br />This is where you’ll include everything from computers to software
					related to the launch.<br />Will you need storage space for miscellaneous plants or
					supplies?<br />Miscellaneous is a term that we use to represent additional items that are not
					included
					in any of the other areas.<br />Usually, they are minor items or items where there are only one or
					two
					of them and that they are not a major budget line.<br />Be sure to add these items to your
					expenses.<br />You’ll also need a few more line items.<br />Start with the fixed cost that won’t
					change
					over the course of the project.<br />Let’s say you’re paying to advertise the web developer role to
					a
					job board.<br />It may cost you about $50 to post that job description.<br />That’s an example of a
					fixed, one-time cost.<br />Next, you’ll need a line item for things like travel expenses and
					meals.<br />And, finally, we’ll want to account for buffers and reserves.<br />You’ll need to factor
					in
					unexpected costs that may come up later on.<br />Be sure to leave yourself with some buffer
					room.<br />We’ve chosen to account for 5% of the overall project budget as our buffer.<br />This is
					a
					standard practice, and depending upon how much detail you know about the project already, you can
					raise
					or lower your percentage for reserves.<br />The client needs to be aware of this buffer in case
					spending
					starts to become excessive, in which case, you need to problem solve with the client and agree to
					adjust
					the scope.<br />You’ll want to include a planned cost versus actual cost column too.<br />This way,
					you
					can keep track of your cost every step of the way.<br />We’ll provide you with concrete budget
					templates
					in the readings associated with this section so you can fully immerse yourself in the
					process.<br />Remember, every project will have an estimated cost and a final cost.<br />Your goal
					is to
					get your estimated cost as close to the final cost as possible.<br />You may have to recalibrate
					your
					estimations during the project.<br />That’s when the estimated cost to complete the project comes
					in.<br />The final cost of your project differs from the forecasted or estimated cost if you weren’t
					exactly on target with your budget.<br />Remember, while your goal is to get as close to the
					original
					estimate as possible, that won’t always be the case.<br />Each time you’re placed on a new project,
					it
					will be helpful to look back on the final costs of previous projects and see how close you came to
					your
					goal.<br />Now you know the best way to create a project budget.<br />Up next, we’re going to talk
					about
					maintaining a budget.<br />See you there.<br />[MUSIC PLAYING] Now that you have an idea of how to
					create a budget, we’re going to discuss how you’ll manage that budget and explore some challenges
					that
					you might face, like being under or over budget.<br />As mentioned previously, you’ll want to check
					in
					on your budget regularly.<br />But what exactly does that mean?<br />What are you checking
					for?<br />How
					can you tell if you’re staying within your budget or not?<br />Monitoring the budget is crucial for
					a
					project manager to enforce accountability in terms of spending.<br />By monitoring your budget
					regularly, you’ll be able to tell if the plans you set into action are actually being implemented on
					both a financial and operational level.<br />As you may recall from previous video, a milestone is
					an
					important point within the project schedule that indicates progress and usually signifies the
					completion
					of a deliverable or phase of the project.<br />Milestones are a metric for tracking progress in the
					project.<br />Milestones are a great opportunity to re-review the budget to identify if anything
					needs
					to be reset or revisited throughout the project.<br />That said, milestones can act as a checkpoint
					for
					budget management and payment.<br />You may have agreed in your contract that you get paid at
					certain
					milestones rather than at the end of the project.<br />Fixed contracts are usually paid for when
					certain
					milestones are reached, whereas time and materials contracts are usually paid for monthly based on
					the
					hours worked and other fees associated with the work, like travel and meals.<br />As you monitor
					your
					budget, you’ll want to be on top of cost control.<br />Cost control is a practice where a project
					manager identifies factors that might impact their budget and then creates effective actions to
					minimize
					variances.<br />Think of it this way.<br />It’s proactive budget management.<br />It is much better
					to
					be proactive with your budget than to be reactive with your budget.<br />If you are reacting instead
					of
					anticipating, then you may already have some kind of problem with the budget.<br />In order to
					control
					costs, you should establish a sign-off plan and inform the appropriate stakeholders of any changes
					that
					occur.<br />You’ll have to ask yourself, which stakeholders or sponsor will be approving the
					contractor
					or vendor time sheets?<br />What about invoices?<br />You’ll also need to make sure any changes
					within
					the project budget are agreed upon.<br />For example, you shouldn’t approve a new cost or item if it
					hasn’t been agreed upon or if it isn’t within the scope.<br />And you shouldn’t be spending money if
					it’s not pre-approved by your stakeholder or project sponsor.<br />It is also important to make sure
					there’s good business case before bringing it to the stakeholder.<br />You’ll also need to manage
					changes as they’re made.<br />This involves updating forecasts or estimates and tracking
					everything.<br />You never want to be surprised by budget changes, and you don’t want to have to
					keep
					asking stakeholders for more money.<br />You can prevent that by revisiting these numbers on a
					regular
					basis.<br />You’ll also want to accept that budget misses will happen.<br />It’s your job to bring
					the
					expected cost overruns within acceptable limits.<br />Before the project starts, collaborate with
					the
					project sponsors and key stakeholders to determine an acceptable limit.<br />Is it
					1%?<br />10%?<br />You’ll decide together.<br />In a previous video, we talked briefly about what
					happens when a project goes over or under budget.<br />Having a project go over budget may mean that
					the
					company will have less funds for other areas within the business.<br />So let’s dig a little deeper
					into
					the effects on a company when a project goes under budget.<br />Even though it seems like going
					under
					budget would be a project manager’s dream, it actually isn’t.<br />If you go under budget, it’s an
					indicator of less than satisfactory project management.<br />Going under budget indicates that you
					may
					not have done a good job at initially estimating.<br />Going under budget could also indicate that
					you
					could have spent more money on the project, meaning that you could have possibly had extra resources
					or
					better quality output.<br />And it may mean that the budget for future projects will be
					slashed.<br />The company may figure that since you did this project under budget, you’ll be able to
					do
					future projects under budget too.<br />So that’s not a totally desirable situation to be in
					either.<br />The best option is to adequately account for, adapt, and manage your budget with that
					risk
					in mind.<br />Later on, we’ll cover other strategies more in-depth that you could use to save the
					company money and time.<br />You’ll also learn the ins and outs of identifying and managing risks a
					little later on in the course.<br />In the next lesson, we’ll learn about procurement.<br />See you
					in a
					bit.<br />[MUSIC PLAYING] In the past, we’ve compared project management to starting a new
					hobby.<br />Let’s say you’re trying to take up painting.<br />In order to paint, you’ll need to
					purchase– or in other words, procure– paint supplies and materials.<br />So first, you ask yourself,
					what supplies will you need?<br />What kind of paint will you start with?<br />Do you want to try
					oil
					paint, watercolor, or acrylic?<br />Will you paint on canvas, wood, or paper?<br />You need to
					research
					these choices before you procure your materials.<br />Once your research is done, you can start
					procuring materials, scheduling courses, watching tutorials.<br />And voila, you’re on your way to
					becoming the next Frida Kahlo.<br />So as you may have guessed by now, procurement means obtaining
					all
					of the materials, services, and supplies required to complete the project.<br />You’ll need to
					procure
					vendors as well.<br />Vendors are individuals or businesses who provide essential goods and
					services.<br />Therefore, think of vendor management as procurement for individuals or
					businesses.<br />Vendor management covers the activities included in researching and sourcing
					vendors.<br />Instead of materials, vendor management is often a matter of sourcing for a specific
					service or talent and then managing that relationship.<br />Sourcing talent includes researching and
					obtaining estimated costs from different partner companies you may use on a project.<br />You’ll
					typically use vendors when they provide specialized skills that aren’t available within your
					company.<br />Vendor management entails sourcing vendors, getting quotes for their work, deciphering
					which vendors will best fulfill your needs, negotiating their contracts, setting deadlines for them,
					evaluating performance, and ensuring payments are made.<br />It also entails familiarizing yourself
					with
					regulations– like the Americans with Disabilities Act if you’re working in the US, for example– and
					if
					you’re somewhere else, being aware of similar regulations in that country.<br />Keep in mind that
					not
					every project will require vendors or contractors, and so every project won’t require vendor
					management.<br />Let’s revisit the example of contract workers in the context of Project Plant Pals
					at
					Office Green.<br />Like many companies, Office Green doesn’t have a copywriting department.<br />So
					for
					the launch of Project Plant Pals, you’ll need to use external resources to supply a contracted
					copywriter.<br />This person is a necessary team member on the project because Office Green doesn’t
					have
					copywriters or internal employee resources required to finish this task.<br />This contractor, or
					team
					of contractors, will draft copy for the website for a slated amount of time, and then their work on
					this
					particular project will be complete.<br />Awesome.<br />Now that you know about procurement, in the
					next
					video, we’ll discuss the different phases of the procurement process and how procurement differs
					depending on your approach to project management.<br />See you then.<br />[MUSIC PLAYING] While not
					every single project will require procurement, it’s important to be prepared for it if and when
					procurement does come up.<br />So how do you get started?<br />There are typically five steps that
					make
					up the procurement process.<br />Let’s go over them.<br />First is initiating, which is the planning
					process of defining what help you may need outside of your current resources to hit the project
					goals.<br />In this step, you’ll also make a case for getting extra resources via the procurement
					process.<br />Second is selecting, which entails deciding what supplies you need and which vendors
					you’ll go through.<br />The third step is contract writing, which is where the contracts are
					developed,
					reviewed, and signed.<br />The fourth step is control, which is when you make payments, set up
					logistics
					and requirements to maintain quality, and ensure the service agreement is being met.<br />The fifth
					and
					final step is completing, which is where you’ll measure the success of the procurement.<br />That’s
					a
					quick overview of the procurement process.<br />This high-level cycle of procurement will make more
					sense as we continue on through this course.<br />One thing to note is the procurement process can
					seem
					a little different depending on the project management methodology.<br />There are differences in
					procurement in the context of agile versus traditional.<br />Agile procurement management is often
					more
					collaborative with both the project team and the end supplier than traditional
					approaches.<br />There is
					a heavy emphasis on the relationship between these parties.<br />The whole project team plays a
					larger
					role in identifying what needs to be procured.<br />Rather than featuring contracts that are based
					on
					fixed deliverables, agile procurement management tends to have a living contract that can be adapted
					based on the evaluation of the project.<br />If you think of the word agility, which means to move
					easily and quickly, you’ll be able to remember that agile procurement can change more easily than
					traditional procurement methods.<br />In this process, the team reviews the project or deliverables
					on a
					reoccurring basis and consistently addresses feedback.<br />This way of working is important to
					communicate to your suppliers so they understand the style of working and agree to maintain
					flexibility.<br />Again, it is so important to have a positive relationship with the procurement
					supplier.<br />This is critical, since the contract may need to be renegotiated at multiple points
					during the project.<br />On the other hand, traditional procurement management tends to focus on
					standard contracts with clear terms and deliverables.<br />When it comes to traditional approaches,
					the
					project manager may be responsible for end-to-end procurement instead of the entire team providing
					input.<br />The contracts may feature lengthy and extensive documentation that include fixed
					requirements and comprehensive detail of the services and deliverables.<br />While this may appear
					more
					rigid, the benefit is you’ve outlined clearer workstreams and deadlines.<br />This way, you’re much
					more
					protected from unforeseen circumstances and may not have to pay for unpredictable changes.<br />In
					traditional approaches, the negotiation process can be a little bit trickier.<br />You won’t
					necessarily
					have the room to renegotiate contracts if something changes, so you may have to start the whole
					process
					over again.<br />That’s why being as detailed as possible and spending more time in the negotiation
					phase is incredibly important in a more traditional project management approach.<br />As you may
					have
					guessed, procurement can become pretty complex.<br />But there are some official documents that can
					help
					guide you through the procurement process.<br />[MUSIC PLAYING] There are a few important documents
					that
					help a project manager navigate through each phase of procurement.<br />For instance, in the
					initiating
					phase, a project manager will create a nondisclosure agreement, otherwise known as an NDA.<br />In a
					selecting phase, a project manager creates a request for proposal, or an RFP.<br />In the
					contracting
					phase, a statement of work, or an SOW, is created.<br />Now let’s learn more about these acronyms
					and
					documents.<br />The first important document is a non-disclosure agreement, also known as an
					NDA.<br />NDAs are standard within a lot of companies, and it’s best practice to ask external
					contract
					workers to sign an NDA.<br />The purpose of an NDA is to keep confidential information within the
					organization.<br />So, for instance, if a company is using some kind of proprietary technology on a
					project or preparing for a sensitive product launch, they want to ensure that any conversations or
					information surrounding that technology doesn’t leak out to competitors or to the public before the
					company is ready to launch.<br />For example, in Project Plant Pals, vendors might be required to
					sign
					an NDA because the project is new to market and hasn’t been made public yet.<br />Then we have a
					request
					for proposal or an RFP, a document that outlines the details and requirements of an organization’s
					project to be passed on to vendors.<br />RFPs are used to solicit bids from vendors so that you can
					then
					select which vendor might be the best for your project.<br />A RFP is widely used within different
					departments in a company and across various industries.<br />An RFP typically includes an overview
					of
					the project, the desired outcomes and goals, budget, deadlines, milestones, and contact information
					so
					each vendor can get back to you with a detailed proposal of how they plan to tackle the
					job.<br />When
					creating an RFP, make sure to add the following headers to your document.<br />The overview– treat
					this
					section like a general summary.<br />What is the purpose of this project?<br />What problems will it
					solve?<br />What new doors will it open for the company?<br />Your goals– what are some measurable
					results you can aim to achieve throughout the process?<br />Next is the scope of work.<br />What are
					the
					specifics of the project?<br />How are you going to achieve those goals and make sure the project
					launches successfully?<br />Then include milestones.<br />Make sure to highlight the key milestones
					your
					project will include.<br />Lastly, include submission requirements, like “please submit the RFP as a
					presentation and include three prototypes,” as well as the questions you’d like the vendor to answer
					as
					part of the process.<br />This helps you properly assess potential vendors.<br />For instance, you
					might
					want to know what issues a contractor sees upfront or how the costs will break down.<br />After the
					RFP
					is sent out, various vendors will review it, and if they feel they can fulfill your project’s needs,
					they’ll provide a proposal.<br />For example, you may create an RFP for Project Plant Pals to source
					plant providers.<br />In this case, you’ll want to send out RFPs to all possible plant providers to
					ensure that you’re getting the best price, quality, and overall value.<br />You may hear RFP being
					used
					as a verb, as in, has this been RFPed yet?<br />That’s really a way of asking if an RFP has been
					sent
					out to vendors yet.<br />It’s important to note that both the NDA and the RFP are fixed and remain
					the
					same throughout the process.<br />This means that there’s not a lot of room for customization, and
					it
					won’t be changed once it’s submitted.<br />Lastly, there’s a third important document called a
					statement
					of work, or an SOW.<br />An SOW is sent after the vendor is selected and evolves as the project goes
					on.<br />[MUSIC PLAYING] Let’s continue learning about the necessary documents required for a
					successful
					project.<br />After you’ve sent a request for proposal to clients, and you’ve selected the vendor,
					client, or contractor you want to work with, you’ll also send them an SOW, or a statement of
					work.<br />A statement of work is a document that clearly lays out the products and services a
					vendor or
					contractor will provide for the organization.<br />An SOW also provides a description of the
					contractor’s needs and requirements to properly perform the agreed-upon services.<br />Although the
					SOW
					covers the customer’s needs, it’s equally as important to include the organization’s needs and the
					vendor’s needs too.<br />It’s critical that all parties involved understand what is expected from
					each
					of them in order to deliver the best possible products or services.<br />The project manager is
					tasked
					with developing the SOW, but often asks for input from subject matter experts, or SMEs, for
					technical
					expertise that the project manager may not have.<br />Your organization’s legal advisors will review
					this document with you and may even be crafting it alongside you.<br />Let’s discuss how to create
					an
					SOW in the example of Project Plant Pals.<br />You’ll want to start by including page headers with
					your
					company name, project, and creation date on them.<br />At the top of the page, make sure to include
					important stakeholders like yourself as the project manager and the name of the sponsor, which in
					this
					case is the director of product.<br />Next, you’ll construct a table for revisions.<br />The SOW
					will
					likely go through a few rounds of revisions because several stakeholders may review it and suggest
					changes.<br />You’ll detail those changes in this box here.<br />Next, you’ll create a purpose
					section,
					where you’ll go into detail about exactly what the desired outcomes are.<br />Make sure to include a
					section regarding your target audience, and make sure it’s inclusive of everyone.<br />For instance,
					in
					this case, the purpose of the project is to launch a new service that provides desk plants to
					offices
					and commercial businesses.<br />If you have more specific goals, you can list them here
					too.<br />Next
					is the scope section, where you’ll include what the service entails.<br />You may write that the
					service
					includes providing customers with small, low-maintenance plants that they can place on their
					desks.<br />Customers can order plants online or from a print catalog.<br />Office Green will ship
					the
					plants to the customer’s work address.<br />The types of plants in scope include 6-inch leafy ferns,
					small cacti, and 5-inch bonsai trees.<br />Keeping this vendor in mind, some major activities may be
					storing the plants in a warehouse, maintaining the health of the plants by providing them with water
					and
					light, sourcing the vases, and ensuring that the vases are in near-perfect condition upon
					delivery.<br />You’ll also want to mention what’s out of scope, or in other words, what the project
					doesn’t include.<br />This will eliminate any potential room for confusion and help set expectations
					with the vendor.<br />For instance, you may write that the project doesn’t include annual reporting
					or
					custom plant orders that are not mentioned in the scope.<br />This helps draw clear lines and sets
					the
					right expectations with the vendor.<br />For deliverables, you’ll want a concise statement about
					what
					your project will deliver.<br />For example, your Office Green project deliverables could include
					the
					vendor providing maintenance guides on how to take care of the plants or that the vendor will be
					responsible for developing a support page on Office Green’s website to address any questions or
					concerns.<br />Since milestones are such an integral part of tracking progress, budget, and scope,
					they’ll need to be included here too.<br />Examples of milestones in Project Plant Pals could be to
					fulfill the first quarter of plant orders, deliver to all of the top customers, launch customer
					satisfaction surveys, collect and report on any insights from customer feedback.<br />You’ll want to
					make it really clear on how many hours are needed for the completion of this project here.<br />And
					you
					will want to designate a particular date that you need their services performed by here.<br />At the
					bottom, you’ll typically add terms and conditions and any other disclaimers.<br />It’s good to have
					a
					disclaimer stating that revisions may take place as the project goes on.<br />This is important to
					include just in case the scope changes because of unforeseen issues.<br />It’s a good idea to add
					revisions into the disclaimer because, as a project manager, it’s best not to overpromise and
					under-deliver.<br />You always want to be clear that you intend to stick to the schedule unless
					circumstances outside of your control intervene.<br />Another part of your SOW is payment
					terms.<br />This outlines when your suppliers need to be paid.<br />Ensuring that suppliers are paid
					on
					time will promote strong relationships.<br />Generally, good procurement practice would be to pay
					your
					vendors and contractors upon delivery of goods and service, not before, unless a circumstantial
					agreement has been made– for instance, if Office Green’s plant provider requested to be paid when
					each
					milestone was completed instead of after the entire project is finished.<br />Great job.<br />Now
					you
					know more about SOWs.<br />Next up, we’ll discuss the importance of partnering with your legal team
					during the procurement process.<br />See you there.<br />[MUSIC PLAYING] Now that you have a better
					understanding about NDAs, RFPs, and SOWs, let’s discuss how you can get support from other
					departments
					and team members as procurement goes forward.<br />The procurement process doesn’t end after you’ve
					selected vendors and signed contracts.<br />You’ll use performance trackers and meetings, like
					quarterly
					business reviews, to track and evaluate overall performance to ensure that both parties are living
					up to
					their initial agreement.<br />And when there are contracts and paperwork with terminology that you
					may
					not be familiar with, you’ll enlist the help of a legal team.<br />Depending on the company’s size,
					the
					legal situation may vary.<br />Some companies, usually well-established and larger businesses, will
					have
					a legal team.<br />Some businesses may outsource their legal team.<br />Some startups or smaller
					companies may not have a legal team, but they might reach out to legal advisors as
					needed.<br />Again,
					this all depends on the company where you work.<br />Laws surrounding manufacturing products and
					consumerism will vary from country to country, but there will nearly always be laws in place that
					you’ll
					need to follow around topics like fair and ethical trade.<br />Most companies have a mission or
					value
					statement.<br />Sometimes a team of people in the ethics and compliance departments are tasked with
					ensuring that the day-to-day operations are adhering to their value statement and governmental
					policies.<br />These team members will also be tasked with duties like working to prevent
					discrimination
					and making sure that the company is practicing adequate corporate social responsibility.<br />Also,
					as a
					project manager, you’ll need to ensure that the various stakeholders who are representing the
					business
					are adhering to these policies and processes too.<br />You’ll all need to be aware of any pertinent
					meetings regarding legal or compliance issues, and you, as a project manager, will have to remind
					the
					team about when those meetings are being held.<br />Looping in the appropriate stakeholders is
					especially critical if there’s some kind of necessary approval, since it’ll have an impact on the
					project one way or another.<br />Like most projects, for Project Plant Pals, looping in legal and
					compliance for review and approvals is really important.<br />For instance, let’s say some of the
					offices where you’re delivering plants are pet-friendly.<br />In your contract with the supplier,
					you’ve
					specified that you want to offer non-toxic plants only.<br />Unfortunately, the supplier provided a
					plant with leaves that are harmful to animals.<br />Office Green could potentially be liable and in
					legal trouble because this critical detail was missed.<br />Pretty crucial consideration,
					right?<br />So, regardless of your future company’s legal team or advisory, having contracts
					reviewed in
					some capacity make good business sense and should be a priority for you as a project
					manager.<br />Now
					you’re on your way to becoming your own lawyer.<br />Only kidding.<br />But you hopefully have a
					better
					grasp of the importance of your legal team and having them review your contracts.<br />Next up,
					we’ll
					discuss the importance of checking in with your vendors.<br />And we’ll find out what compliance has
					to
					do with the procurement process.<br />I’ll see you soon.<br />[MUSIC PLAYING] We’ve learned a bit
					about
					the ins and outs of contracting with vendors, so let’s learn more about the importance of ethics
					when
					partnering with vendors.<br />Failing to be mindful when choosing vendors can lead to significant
					consequences.<br />If you’ve seen a company in the news that’s been entangled in a scandal, that
					usually
					means that the team probably should have done more research in the procurement process.<br />So what
					does that entail?<br />There’s a lot that can be done to ensure that businesses are operating in an
					ethical way.<br />Project managers have a big job when deciphering whether or not every aspect of
					their
					project is sourced ethically.<br />It helps if the project manager thoroughly oversees the project
					to
					make sure the safety, economic, and environmental ethical risks are mitigated.<br />In other words,
					doing a lot of research monitoring and evaluating throughout the project is a project manager’s
					job.<br />There are a couple of steps to safeguard ethical procurement.<br />The first is knowing
					your
					business’s legal requirements.<br />You’ll want to have a deep understanding of what is required of
					you
					legally as a project manager for your business.<br />You can also seek out the code of ethics for
					your
					profession, which in this case is for project managers.<br />For instance, the Project Management
					Institute, also known as PMI, has a code of ethics that you can access as a member or
					credential-holder.<br />This will help you understand some parameters for how to assess ethical
					versus
					unethical procurement.<br />According to the PMI’s Code of Ethics, honesty, responsibility, respect,
					and
					fairness are the values that drive ethical conduct for the project management profession.<br />So
					when
					you become a project manager, if you aren’t totally sure if something is ethical, first, try to use
					your
					best judgment based on what you believe those words mean and continue to do the required
					research.<br />If you still aren’t sure, don’t hesitate to ask a subject matter expert, such as
					someone
					from the legal team.<br />As a starting point, some unethical issues or risks you may run into may
					include bribery or corruption.<br />Some regulations in other countries may not be the same as
					regulations in your country.<br />So, for example, you’ll want to make sure laborers involved in
					production are treated fairly, working in good conditions, and are compensated adequately for their
					work.<br />It is a good idea to consult your legal team to ensure that you don’t run into these
					situations and to be aware of the regulations surrounding your processes.<br />You will also want to
					be
					aware of possible issues with sole-supplier sourcing.<br />In some scenarios, you may need to
					perform
					noncompetitive procurement, which is when a company restricts the bidding process to one
					supplier.<br />This may be common for companies who are more cautious about exposing trade
					secrets.<br />But, regardless of your reasoning, you’ll need to be able to justify exactly why you
					are
					choosing to restrict bidding to one supplier.<br />There’s also interaction with state-owned
					entities.<br />You’ll want to be vigilant when dealing with government agencies and
					officials.<br />Government agencies may have tighter restrictions and regulations in regard to
					sourcing,
					and you don’t want to do anything unethical without even knowing it.<br />A project manager monitors
					the
					project’s ethics throughout the whole process.<br />In the initiating phase, you will need to decide
					whether the project is ethical in the first place.<br />Does it meet your business’s code of
					ethics?<br />Does the project meet environmental ethics laid out by governmental agencies?<br />Is
					the
					labor going to be ethically sourced?<br />You’ll need to review government regulations and policies,
					assess potential risks, and put together a diverse team that you trust to be ethical.<br />Before
					the
					contracts are signed, you’ll want to figure out whether the suppliers you’re thinking of hiring are
					ethical.<br />You’ll want to make sure that you’re procuring them in an ethical way and are paying
					them
					a fair rate.<br />And you’ll also want to completely understand the supply chain if there is
					one.<br />After the contracts have been signed by your contractors, make sure to carry out your
					assurance duties.<br />This may include things like auditing each task and cost, executing quality
					control, or even approving invoices.<br />During the production of your service or product, focus on
					the
					day-to-day relationships with vendors to make sure they’re aware of and meeting your deliverables
					and
					keeping you informed of any potential roadblocks.<br />After you’ve done all the research that you
					possibly can on whether your project is ethical, remember to trust yourself.<br />If something feels
					wrong, it probably is.<br />As you know, there’s a lot to keep track of as a project manager by
					keeping
					these ethical principles in mind as you begin your project.<br />[MUSIC PLAYING] Wow, we really
					covered
					a lot here.<br />We learned all about managing costs and budget.<br />We learned that a project
					budget
					is the estimated monetary resources needed to achieve outlined goals and objectives.<br />We learned
					that a project budget is much more nuanced than just aiming to save money.<br />It’s a success
					metric
					that’s used to track project performance.<br />And remember, it’s not desirable to be over budget or
					under budget.<br />We also learned that cost control involves several stakeholders, sign-off from
					key
					stakeholders, and actively managing changes.<br />And we definitely went in-depth on procurement and
					vendor management, which involves obtaining the necessary supplies, materials, and external
					resources
					for your project’s success.<br />We learned the important steps initiating, selecting, contract
					writing,
					control, and completing.<br />We now know that procurement will be different depending on which
					methodology you’re using.<br />An agile procurement approach differs from a traditional procurement
					approach.<br />It’s more relationship-based because the negotiation stays open the whole
					time.<br />An
					agile procurement requires more frequent communication with vendors because the contracts may be
					reviewed and adjusted regularly.<br />The traditional approach is typically done during a
					procurement
					stage and ends there.<br />We learned about NDAs, RFPs, and SOWs, and we created an SOW
					together.<br />Finally, you learned a bit about how to think critically when it comes to ethics and
					procurement.<br />You learned how to adhere to a code of ethics, when to use your own judgment, and
					the
					importance of researching the ethics of procurement.<br />Nice job.<br />Next up, you’re going to
					learn
					about different types of risks, how to identify risk, and how to mitigate risk.<br />See you
