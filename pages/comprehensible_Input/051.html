					did you know that in English we use words every day that come from other languages without even
					realizing it today I am going to show you some words in English that come from French Italian German
					and Spanish and even Japanese that native English speakers use all the time let's  go hi guys
					I'm Kyle and on my channel pensando Eng La bringing you guys is real comprehensible English is what
					I do so are you ready to improve your English and learn some words that come from other languages
					that we use all the time in English conversations all right let's start with French here are some
					words that come from French number one deja vu deja vu literally means already seen or in Spanish
					yav Visto and it describes that weird feeling when you experience something and you feel like you've
					already been through it before like you've already lived that moment in time here's an example sense
					of how we might use deja vu in English as I walked into the cafe I had a strange feeling of deja vu
					as if I had been here before even though I know that I haven't number two entrepreneur an
					entrepreneur is somebody who starts and runs their own business and in French it literally means
					somebody who takes on a task here's an example sentence for entrepreneur Elon Musk is a well-known
					entrepreneur who has started many businesses number three fiance fiance means somebody who is
					engaged to be married and it comes from a French word fiance which means to promise example my best
					friend just got engaged she and her fiance are planning their wedding for next year okay guys now
					Spanish words let's see what the Spanish have contributed to the English language first Spanish word
					that you might very well hear in an English conversation Siesta obviously you guys know that a
					siesta is a short nap usually taken in the early afternoon very common in Spain here is a quick
					example of how we might use this in an English conversation after lunch I took a quick Siesta before
					getting back to work second Spanish word that we use in English patio in Spanish patio is used to
					describe a backyard or a Courtyard area in English we use it to describe an outdoor seating area
					often with tables and chairs here's an example of how we might use patio in English let's eat dinner
					outside on the patio since it's so nice out next let's see what words the German language has
					generously donated to English first Kindergarten now I have heard Spanish speakers say Kinder so you
					guys might be familiar with this one kindergarten literally means Children's Garden in German and it
					refers to the first stage of school for children usually before first grade an example my little
					brother is excited to start kindergarten next year and another word that we use in English that
					comes from the German language and this one is an interesting one guys doppelganger to ganger a
					toppo ganger is somebody who looks exactly like another person but it's not related to them in
					German it literally means double Walker here's an example I just saw a guy who looks exactly like
					you your doppelganger is out there somewhere all right guys how about a couple of Italian words that
					we use in the English language first graffiti graffiti comes from an Italian word grafo which means
					us a scratch a scratch in English it refers to street art or writing on walls usually with spray
					paint here's an example of how we use graffiti in English the city is full of colorful graffiti and
					some of it is actually really artistic another word that comes from Italian that we use in English
					Paparazzi and Paparazzi are photographers who follow around celebrities to take pictures of them the
					word comes from the classic Italian film L do Villa where a character named paparazzo was a very
					persistent photographer an example the paparazzi surrounded the actress as she was trying to leave
					the restaurant trying to Snap photos of her okay guys and the last language that we are going to
					examine today Japanese what have the Japanese contributed to my native language of English first
					karaoke karaoke comes from the Japanese word Cara which means empty and OK which means Orchestra so
					karaoke means empty Orchestra and it refers to singing along to instrumental versions of the song
					and karaoke is quite popular here in the United States at bars so most people don't do karaoke in
					their home unless there's a party but usually people go to bars they drink a lot of alcohol and then
					they go and sing karaoke an example we went to a karaoke bar last night and sang our favorite songs
					it was so much fun and the last word that we will examine today that comes from the Japanese
					language Tycoon and the word tycoon in Japanese originally referred to a powerful Shogun or military
					leader in English it means a very wealthy and influential business person for example Bill Gates is
					a tech Tycoon who helped to shape the modern computer industry so my friends as you can see English
					has borrowed a lot of words from a lot of different languages now tell me guys have you ever used
					these words when you were practicing English without even realizing that it was not actually an
					English word tell me in the comments if you have used one of these words before don't forget to like
					And subscribe for more fun and real English all right my friends for
