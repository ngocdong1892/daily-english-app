					Are you ready to learn real life English with comprehensible input? Well, good because today you are
					going to learn what all of this is.<br>
					You are going to learn some very important verbs in the kitchen and you are going to learn how to
					make a delicious traditional dish from a country called Usbekiststan. Let's go.<br>
					Okay guys, it is your English speakaking friend Kyle and today we are going to keep on improving our
					English with comprehensible input. What is comprehensible input? Comprehensible input is when a
					native speaker like me speaks slowly and clearly so that you can understand. And guys, today I'm
					excited. I'm happy because we're going to do something very fun for me and very useful for you guys.
					We're going to cook a dish. Okay, we're going to prepare a very traditional dish, a very special
					dish in this part of the world and it looks absolutely delicious. So, me and my lovely camera wife
					cannot wait to eat it. So guys, I'm going to show you all kinds of things in English in the kitchen,
					all kinds of ingredients, a lot of different verbs that are very important. Guys, this is going to
					be a great video. You're going to learn a ton of vocabulary. You're going to absorb naturally my
					native language of English and you're going to see how to make this delicious dish. So, first of
					all, let me say what the dish is called. The dish is called Plav. The dish is called Plav and it's
					from a country called Usbekistsan.<br>
					This subscriber asked me if I would create Plav. And of course I will. Of course, with pleasure. So
					today we're creating Plav. Maybe we'll learn a little bit about Usbekiststan along the way because
					you guys learn about my life and the life here in the United States by watching these videos. But I
					want to learn about you guys, too. So, shout out to all of the people all around the world watching
					right now. If you would like to see me make a dish from your country, tell me in the comments and I
					might just do it. All right, guys. First thing we're going to do is cut our vegetables. This is an
					onion. This is an onion. I'm going to cut this onion. Oh, one interesting thing I wanted to say that
					I learned about Usbekiststan and this dish today while I was looking on the internet. In
					Usbekistsan, only the men make these big dishes of plav because they know that men are the best
					cooks. Isn't that right, wife?<br>
					Sometimes. She says sometimes. He is the best. He's the chef. Oh, thank you, baby. All right, guys.
					Let's cut this onion.
					All right, guys. That is one cut or sliced onion. To slice just means to cut, guys. Same thing. Got
					our onion ready. Now, guys, these are carrots.<br>
					Okay, these are carrots. And I cannot just cut these. I have to do something else to these carrots
					first. Camera wife, what do I have to do to these carrots? Wash them. No, peel them. Peel them. I
					don't have to wash them because I'm going to peel them. Let me show you guys what peeling is. Okay,
					guys. This is called a peeler. A peeler. And we're going to peel this carrot. To peel means that you
					peel that outer layer off. That is peeling a carrot. Now guys, I never peel carrots when I cook with
					them, but I'm trying my best to be respectful to the Usbekistan tradition. And over there they peel
					them when they make plav. Now I'm going to peel this carrot with my peeler. All right guys, our
					carrots are peeled. Now we're going to slice them thinly. Thinly into thin slices like this. So you
					want them nice and thin.<br>
					Nice and thin. Okay guys, got our vegetables here. Now from what I've seen on my research in my
					research on YouTube inspe [Music] hundreds of people because they do them for things like weddings
					or even funerals. I saw a wedding is when two people get married. A funeral is when somebody dies or
					passes away and you celebrate their life. You remember them.<br>
					So this is a very important dish uh in the Usbekiststan culture and I am honored to know what it is
					now and to make it. But my point is I do not have one of those giant dishes. The best thing I have
					is this. This is called a walk. That's what I'm going to use. So we need to put some oil in the
					walk. And we're going to use a half a cup of oil to cook the meat.<br>
					This is a measuring cup. I know guys that you do not use this in your country. Unless you are in
					Britain, then you might. But chances are you don't use this. You probably measure it out in
					milliliters or use grams. All right, guys. Let's put our walk on the fire so that oil can start to
					heat up. All right, come here, camera wife. Come here. Come here. Come here. Come here, camera wife.
					We've got some water boiling. When the water gets very hot, starts making bubbles, we call that
					boiling. And I am boiling water right now because many people enjoy eating their puff with hard
					boiled eggs. Okay, so to hard boil eggs, you put eggs in boiling water and they get hard. Okay,
					they're no longer liquid. And uh that is something that is traditional to eat with plav. All right,
					guys. Now it is time to cut our meat. But first, I need to sharpen my knife. This is a very good
					verb for the kitchen, guys. Sharp is an adjective that means it can cut.<br>
					Ow. Ow. It can cut you easily. Okay.<br>
					Sharp. Knives are sharp. This peeler is sharp. Okay. And now we're going to use this knife sharpener
					to sharpen to sharpen my knife. I am sharpening my knife. with my knife sharpener. All right, guys.
					Time to cut our meat.<br>
					Camera wife, what kind of animal is this meat from? I forgot lamb. Lamb. This is a lamb, guys. And
					this is lamb meat. Uh lamb meat is the most traditional meat used for plav, but you can also use
					beef. So, we want to cut it into nice big pieces like this. Nice big pieces.<br>
					And this has bone in it. And guys, when you cook with bone, that adds so much extra flavor to your
					dish. So, we're going to cook the bone with a little bit of meat on it, too. I can't wait.
					All right, guys. Let's put some salt on our meat. Just a little bit because a lot more spices and
					seasonings are going to go into the dish. So, when I say spices and seasonings, guys, I'm talking
					about things like these, okay? Turmeric, paprika, black pepper, salt. We call those things
					seasonings or spices.<br>
					Either one of those words means the same thing. It's something that you put on your food to make it
					taste good. All right, let's get our meat into our walk.<br>
					Okay, guys. Now, another important kitchen verb to stir. To stir means you mix something up, you
					move it around with a spoon or with something like this. This is like a spatula. This is what
					spatulas. This is a spatula.<br>
					Spatulas normally look like this, but this one's made out of wood. It's a really nice one that my
					wife got. So, we're using the wooden spatula. We're going to stir up the meat. Oh, yes.
					All right, guys. Let's get our spices ready. So once again, we're using a measurement. Can you show
					me my closer?<br>
					We're using a measurement that you guys will not be using. This is a teaspoon.
					Okay. But this is how we measure things here. Any recipe in the US is going to say teaspoons or
					tablespoons. The big one. So right here we've got cumin.<br>
					Cumin. You guys may know it more like this in its seed form when it's whole, but this is powder. We
					need two teaspoons cumin. This is called turmeric.<br>
					One teaspoon of this smoked paprika, which is a pepper, guys. A pepper that they cooked over fire to
					give it a smoky flavor. I'm going to do 1 and a2 smoked paprika, one tablespoon black pepper, and
					another teaspoon of salt. Those are our spices. Looking colorful and beautiful. All right, guys. Our
					beef is cooking now. It's got some color to it.<br>
					We're going to add our onions now to the walk. And we're going to stir and let that cook until the
					onions get smaller.<br>
					Okay, guys. It smells so good in here. I can't wait to try this. The onions are cooked now. So, it
					was time to add the carrots. And once again, what do we do, wife? What is this? Stir. We are going
					to stir. Now, we stir. Stir and mix all this up. Thank you. Thank you to the subscriber who
					recommended that I make this. I cannot wait. And I would have never known about this dish. I'm super
					excited.<br>
					Okay, guys. We're going to let the carrots cook for a couple minutes, then I'll show you the next
					step. All right, guys. As we've been cooking the carrots for a few minutes, now it's time to add our
					spices. This is going to smell so good and it's going to give it a beautiful color. Now we stir.
					All right, guys. You can see that the spices gave it an incredible color. It smells delicious. Now I
					need to add some water to cover it up. You do it just to the top of the meat like that. This is a
					can of chickpeas. Chickpeas. Some of you may know them as garbanzo beans. That's what they look
					like. And then we're going to put our garbanzo beans in here.<br>
					Once again, little bit of a mix. And then we have garlic. The whole thing, guys, the whole piece of
					garlic we call a bulb a bulb of garlic. And each one we call a clove a clove of garlic. In Spanish
					they call each one teeth.<br>
					But we're going to put this whole piece of garlic right here in the middle. And we're going to put
					these two chili peppers right here and right here. Now, wife, are those chili peppers going to make
					this very spicy? Are those chili peppers going to make that whole dish very spicy? Wife, I don't
					know. What do you guys think? Will that make the whole thing very spicy? No, because it's not cut.
					It's a smart wife. No, because I did not cut it. So, we'll only let out a little bit of heat and a
					whole lot of flavor. Now, if I cut them and open them up so the seeds could get out, that would be
					very spicy. All right, guys.<br>
					Look at this beautiful dish we've got going here.
					We're getting there, guys. We're getting there. I'm going to let this cook for about 20, 30 minutes,
					and I'll show you guys what it looks like then. Okay, guys. You would not believe how it smells in
					here. Baby, please show them what it looks like.<br>
					Incredible. So guys, next step, we take the garlic. The garlic, we take that out for now. We take
					the peppers. Take the peppers out and put those to the side.<br>
					Put them to the side. Now we add an ingredient that for me seemed a little strange, but I think it's
					going to taste good. Raisins. Hold on. Raisins. These are raisins, guys. And a raisin. A raisin is
					just a grape that they put out in the sun until it dries up and looks like that. Have a raisin wife.
					Does it taste good, baby? Okay, I'm going to eat this. You just eat raisins. Now we put our raisins
					in here. And what do we do?<br>
					Stir. We stir.
					Oh yeah, we stir. Wow. I wish you guys could smell this. Okay, now rice. I already washed this rice,
					guys. I washed it. drained it. I washed it. I drained it. So, this is very clean rice. Now, we put
					it over the top. Put it right on top. I want to kind of make it even to cover everything up. Now, my
					wife is happy. Guys, Colombians eat rice with everything. So, now this is a Colombian approved dish.
					Well, it had the beans in it earlier, so she was probably happy about that, too. All right. So guys,
					there's one more ingredient we're going to put in here and it is called saffron.<br>
					Okay, saffron. Guys, this is a very valuable spice and it is actually more expensive than gold by
					weight because it's so light. But this is a very treasured spice all around the world.
					And from what I see, not everybody puts it in plav, but for special occasions like a fancy wedding
					or if you want to impress a guest, you could put some saffron in there and it will give it some good
					color. It will make it smell good and it'll make it taste good. And guys, this is a special
					occasion, okay?<br>
					It's my first time making puav. You only get one first time doing anything. So now we put water in
					again to cover the rice.<br>
					It should look like that. Then we turn up the heat. Turn up the heat. Turn up the fire. And we're
					going to cook this until the rice sucks up all the water and it looks dry. So, I'll see you guys in
					a few. Okay guys, everything's coming together. We're about to do the final steps. I just wanted to
					tell you guys a little bit of Ubekistan history that I read today and found pretty interesting.
					So there have been many different ruling powers in Usbekistsan. For example, in 329 BC, Alexander
					the Great occupied Usbekistsan. Roughly 3 or 400 years later, the Arabs took over and converted the
					country to Islam, which is why most of the population today is Muslim.
					Roughly 600 years after that, Djangghask Khan took over and ruled Usbekistsan, bringing it into the
					Mongolian Empire.<br>
					Later, several hundred years later, Russia took over and ruled Usbekiststan for almost 200 years
					until Usbekiststan finally gained its independence. Why this strikes me as interesting guys, that is
					so many cultures, so many different cultures in one piece of land.<br>
					And that is why we have incredible dishes like this. The mixes of the Asian cultures, it's in
					Central Asia. But Gangaskhan, Alexander the Great brought things from Macedonia, the Russian
					influence, and by the way, Russian is the second most widely spoken language in Usbekistsan. I just
					thought that was pretty interesting. All right, guys.<br>
					Let's get back to the plow. So, as you can see, most of the water has been absorbed into the rice.
					Now, I'm going to mix the rice up a little bit. Oh, that looks so flavorful, guys. Make it into like
					a mountain. The plav mountain.
					We're going to call this mount plav.
					Okay, guys. And then you poke holes in it like this.
					Boom.
					Boom. Boom.
					Boom. That's going to help the steam.<br>
					And then you put a plate over it like that. Now we're going to leave it like that for about 15
					minutes and then my hungry little wife can finally try plav.
					See you guys in a few. All right, guys.
					It's finally done. Going to plate it up in a minute. But first, let me show you one other thing that
					we use the verb to peel for in the kitchen. To peel hard-boiled eggs. So, you crack the shell.
					That's called cracking the shell.<br>
					And then peel the egg. You peel the shell off of the egg. So, we peeled the carrots and now I am
					peeling the eggs.<br>
					It's ready. I'm nervous to try this because I worked really hard on it.
					Can't wait. I'm going to plate it. To plate means you put it on the what, wife? Plate. The plate.
					Guys, for me, when I'm cooking, plating is the most important thing because if it looks delicious,
					it makes it taste better, I think. So, let's plate this. So, let's see if I could make this dish
					look like some art. Got a great color on the rice.<br>
					So, let's get some rice on the plate first. Wow. Some raisins on there. Okay, guys. This, my
					friends, my version of usi plav. Now, I want my wife to do the honors of trying it first. So, camera
					wife, I'm going to be the camera husband now. Okay, baby. Try it. Okay. Can we see? It's not too
					hot. Mhm. Wow. It's like sweet and salty at the same time.<br>
					From 1 to 10. M. It's same for me cuz he's the ch.
					Wow. Even the rice is incredible. And the raisins, guys, they're just right.
					It's not super sweet. It's just a little bit. That is absolutely delicious. Hold on a second. I
					forgot about the peppers.<br>
					Mhm.
					All right, guys. We got to go. We got to eat this. Thank you guys for watching.<br>
					And Ratma, Ratma, I believe, is how you say thank you in Usuzbekistan. So, thank you guys. Those of
					you who are in Usbekistan watching me, those of you who are all around the world, I appreciate every
					single one of you.
