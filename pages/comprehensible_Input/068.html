					reason in our lives or is everything just put across while he died things um um things happen things
					happen for a reason for me it will happen for a reason because I don't know but um things happen for
					a reason okay because you like to be positive you like to look at it like that yes okay me too I

					our lives sometimes you're thinking why did this happen to me but then later it turns out that it
					was a very important lesson that you had to learn um my phone yesterday I broke and I think the all
					things happen very soon because tomorrow maybe I have a new cell phone yeah okay there you go
					positivity positivity so sometimes I ask people are you a positive or A negative person obviously
					you're a positive person do you think that people in general are usually good or bad I think the
					people but in Argentina the people for example complain to complain yeah all the time for all the
					things and never and it's like um so you're a positive person do you think that you are a happy
					person [Music] um I think see I think that being grateful is me happy person okay but you are an
					empath so does that mean that you feel sad sometimes as well yes um yes I'm very sad when the people
					in my around is that um yes all my friends or one situation when my mom is tired I feel tired I
					think okay interesting interesting okay so you being an empath do you think that it is important
					sometimes to cry yes uh I like to crying because it's a feeling in the people according okay do you
					think men Hombres should cry too or men should always be strong no I think all the people um okay we
					all need to cry to feel better yeah I think it's important to laugh a lot too yes um it's important
					to feel I think those were all the questions that I had is there any question that you would like to
					ask me yes where do you live I live in a state called Indiana have you heard of Indiana uh yes for
