					Are you ready to learn some real life English with comprehensible input? Well, good, because today
					we are going to improve our English by cooking a dish and learning some facts from a place that
					really needs our support right now, Palestine. Let's go. Hey guys, it is your English- speakaking
					friend Kyle.<br>
					And today we've got an excellent but also very important video. I'll tell you why it's important
					later. It's going to be excellent because you're going to learn a ton of English vocabulary.
					You're going to see a delicious dish being cooked and later there's going to be some very important
					lessons that I think the whole world needs to see and learn. So, what is comprehensible input?
					Comprehensible input is when a native speaker like me speaks slowly and clearly so that you can
					understand.<br>
					Today guys, we're cooking a delicious dish traditional to Palestine. It's called Makluba. And these
					are all of our ingredients. We've got all of our vegetables. This is called eggplant.
					This is a new one on the channel. This is a new one on the channel.
					Cauliflower. We've got potatoes.<br>
					Tomatoes, which are a what, wife?
					I don't know.
					A fruit or a vegetable?
					A fruit.<br>
					Tomatoes are a fruit. We've got onions, garlic, got some rice over here. This is going to cook with
					our lamb. Our meat is lamb. You could do chicken, but camera wife, and I love lamb, so we're doing
					lamb today. We've got black limes, cardamom pods, cumin seeds, black pepper, cinnamon, salt, bay
					leaves, and over here we've got all the spices you'd find in a Middle Eastern kitchen. So guys,
					we're going to make this delicious meal. I cut everything up because the important part of this
					video is not going to be the cooking. It's going to be about the very important things we talk about
					later. So, let's get the cooking going so we can get to all that important stuff. Before I start
					cooking, I just want to say this video is dedicated to a subscriber named Kum. Kum wrote me an
					email. He told me many important things about Palestine, what's going on in Gaza right now. He was
					even kind enough to send me videos of where he and his family are right now. And they they worked
					hard to get some rice and vegetables, and they were able to make some makluba. He sent me a picture
					of his beautiful little sister smiling and enjoying her dinner. I was so happy to see them have a
					nice meal as a family. So, Kum, thank you, my friend.<br>
					This video is for you and your family.
					Please tell them I said hello. Let's go.
					All right, guys. First thing we need to do is get our meat cooking. So, we're going to put these
					spices in our pot.<br>
					We've got some oil heating up. And the oil cooking these spices is going to make them fragrant.
					Camera wife, what does fragrant mean?<br>
					Uh, like the smell means that you can smell them. They start to smell better and better. There you
					go. So, we will be smelling that in just a minute. We'll throw a little bit of onion in here and a
					little bit of garlic. Already smelling good. Okay, we'll start putting our lamb in. That sound is
					good. That means that your your pan or your pot is hot enough. And it's best if you can use some
					meat with bone.<br>
					That's going to make the best flavor.
					Now, we'll put our salt on top of the lamb. Yum. Okay, guys. While the lamb is cooking, I'm going to
					start cooking the onions down, too, cuz that takes a little while.<br>
					I'm going to be doing a lot of things at the same time today. Okay, you guys are going to see if I'm
					a good chef or not, really. Okay, guys, the lamb is starting to take in the flavors from all those
					spices. We're just going to put some water in here. Just enough to cover all of the lamb. Like that.
					And guys, one thing I want to say, if you have clean water to be able to pour in that pot, be
					grateful, cuz there's a lot of people right now that don't. We'll talk more about that later. All
					right, guys. Our lamb is cooking with the water. Got our onions going here. Now we need to fry our
					vegetables. I've got my cast iron skillet. Ow. Cast iron's very hot. Be careful. My cast iron
					skillet. I'm going to use that to fry first my eggplant because we're going to be using this first.
					Wife, have you eaten eggplant before?<br>
					Yes.
					Do you like it?
					I love it.
					Oh, good. Really, we're just going to fry these for a few minutes until they get soft so we can
					start to layer our pot. Camera wife, in Arabic, what does maluba mean?<br>
					Pot.
					No, it means upside down or to flip.
					Because like the dolma, that's what we're going to do with this dish when it's done. I can't wait.
					See you in a minute. All right, guys. I just want to show you a cooking verb that I haven't shown
					you before, and it's to flip.<br>
					Every chef needs to know how to flip with a pan. To flip. I flipped the onions in the pan. So, our
					eggplants are starting to get done. You just want them to be soft like that. Looking delicious
					already. All right, guys. Getting started on the potatoes. I'm going to let these cook over here.
					Another little flip on the onion. Oh, that's starting to look just how we want it. I might actually
					turn that off right now. And then we've got our eggplant. So, like I said, guys, this is a layered
					dish.<br>
					Layering means that you're stacking things on top of each other in layers.
					So, the first layer is going to be tomato. I'm going to put just a little bit of olive oil in here
					so that it doesn't stick. So, we will layer our tomato on the bottom just to cover the bottom as
					much as we can. That's actually kind of perfect. All right. And then I saw everybody doing this
					online, but I hope I won't mess it up. I'm trying to make Kadum's mom proud of me, guys. So, I can't
					disappoint her.<br>
					She did it like this.
					She didn't do it like this because they didn't have the ingredients, but she made her family a
					delicious meal with what they had. Okay. Oo, it's hot.<br>
					Camera wife is going to love that. All right, guys. This is what the potatoes look like. You're not
					really trying to cook them all the way through. Just fry them up a little bit. I'm going to go ahead
					and put the potatoes in next. Try and make another layer. And I'm just going to try and cover the
					bottom of the pot. as good as I can. Doesn't have to be perfect. Nothing in life is perfect except
					for my wife. She's not perfect either. Oh, baby. I love you. Okay. And next, what's next? Wife.
					Lamb.<br>
					No. Onions. We're going to put the onions in next. Now, guys, this is just like every other dish. I
					know. Your grandma, your mom, your aunt, they do it different. Don't Don't type in those comments
					and tell me no, Kyle. It doesn't go tomato, potato, onion. And it goes onion, potato, tomato. I'm
					watching you guys. I know. I just caught somebody. Somebody was about to start typing that. Not
					today, guys. Not today.<br>
					Okay, guys. That's how we're looking right now.
					And I'm working on frying up the cauliflower a little bit. See you in a minute. Okay, guys. I put a
					little layer of rice in this part just to make it all hold together when we cook. Now, the lamb is
					done. I need to separate the meat from all those spices and the broth because the broth has so much
					flavor and that's what we're going to use to cook this this rice. And the rice is just going to eat
					all that flavor up. I can't wait. So, we've got this. This is called a colander strainer, some
					people might say. And this is how we're going to separate the solid things from the liquid. I hope.
					Okay, guys. Camera wife had a great idea. use this instead of that little tiny strainer. So, treat
					your wives good, gentlemen, because they help you a lot. All right. So, we are going to to pour to
					pour this into here and separate the liquid from the meat and spices. Sometimes cooking can be a
					workout, guys.<br>
					This pot is heavy.
					A camera wife says she's getting a workout holding that camera. Guys, look at that broth. That
					liquid is packed with delicious spices, delicious flavor from this lamb.
					And I can't wait. Okay, now we need to put our meat in. Very hot. We've been wanting to eat lamb
					again since what, what was our last uh pla?<br>
					No, Dolma.
					Dolma.
					Plav was the first one. Don't even.
					So, Plav, guys, is what really introduced us to eating lamb.
					Yeah.<br>
					And we love it. And some garlic. So, the camera wife doesn't keep trying to kiss me. She's always
					trying to kiss me, guys. I'm like, "Hey, I'm trying to work." And we're going to put these little
					pieces of garlic just in here.<br>
					And they're going to cook. Keep giving that meat an incredible flavor. Okay, guys. So, I'm going to
					mix all of our spices up. We've got clove, we've got cumin, we've got turmeric, paprika, cinnamon.
					I'm just going to mix these up because I'm going to use some of it now and some a little bit later.
					I want to put some right on this meat so that the lamb is just packed with flavor.
					Super delicious.<br>
					I really want that meat to be the the star of the show. So, it's like guys, I'm the star of this
					show like the lamb.<br>
					And then camera wife is like the cauliflower or I don't know guys. What do you think? What is who's
					the star? Me or camera wife? Okay guys, now get some cauliflower in there. It's our last layer. I
					always get nervous guys even though it usually comes out good. I'm like, what if this time it's bad?
					But worrying about if my dish is going to look good for my YouTube video is a pretty good problem to
					have. And we'll throw some of these onions in there, too, just because we don't want to waste good
					vegetables. Now, what wife? Now, fill it up with rice.<br>
					How long does it take?
					About 20 minutes. Enough time to make our dessert. So, guys, I didn't tell you yet, but we're also
					going to make a delicious dessert. And guys, I have to really give a special thank you to Kadum. Not
					only did he tell me all these facts about Palestine and Gassa and give me a little view into his his
					life and his family's life, but he gave me a huge list of food to try. And without him, I would have
					never known about this or the dessert. So really, I dedicated this video to him because without him,
					it wouldn't have happened. So, I really appreciate when my viewers reach out to me and we can
					communicate and learn together. It's really special for me.<br>
					Now, we'll put the rest of the spices in and all this is going to get mixed in there once I add the
					broth. Camera wife said, "Wow, I can't wait." Okay, guys.
					Now, we're going to just start adding the broth until it covers up the rice.<br>
					All right, guys. So, we filled up the water until it covered the rice. Now fold these back over to
					fold to fold and then my wife said k bonito which means wow beautiful how pretty how beautiful. Just
					wait until you see this wife. It's going to be very bonito. You know what guys tell me in the
					comments how do you say beautiful in your language? I would love to know so that I could call my
					wife beautiful in all the languages. All right guys, we'll start going on the dessert. We're going
					to let this cook.<br>
					See you in a few. Okay guys, so for our dessert, we're going to make something that I believe is
					pronounced kufa. Kufa.
					Did I do okay guys? I know I probably didn't say it right, but I try my best.
					Anyway, the ingredients. This in English we call fileo dough. You may have seen this in the famous
					Dubai chocolate bars.<br>
					And I had to order this online. So this is a product of Turkey uh the country Turkey. So I think in
					Turkish they call it that whereas in Palestine they might call it katifi or something like that.
					But no matter how it's pronounced we are going to make something very delicious.<br>
					But Kadum told me be careful with this because it's very easy to burn it. So we have one lb of the
					filo dough and it looks big but it's going to get smaller.<br>
					And then we're going to pour melted butter on top of it. So, this is a dish with a lot of calories,
					but it's going to be very rich and very delicious. And then mix it all up. Why am I mixing this with
					my hands, right? Why am I using my hands to mix this? Because they're the best thing you can use to
					mix things.<br>
					And they're right here. You don't have to go look for your hands. I don't have to say, "Hey, camera
					wife, where's my hands at? I need them." Nope. They're right here. The perfect tool. God gave us
					hands, so we use them. All right, guys. So, we've got our pan. Our pan is greased. Greased means
					that you have some sort of oil or fat on there. I used butter. Now, I know everybody's going to say,
					"No, you should use ghee." I don't have ghee. All right. I have butter. So, I used butter. Now,
					we'll put a a layer of the felo dough down. Cover the bottom like that. I'm very excited to try
					this, guys. I think this is going to be a delicious one. Camera wife, have we made a dessert yet? We
					made the Russian apples.<br>
					Yeah. Is that the only one?
					Yes.
					All right. I'm very excited. Okay. Got a layer like that. And now guys, the main ingredient of this,
					aside from the dough, is cheese. So, we need a bunch of cheese. And I'm not sure exactly what kind
					of cheese you guys normally use. I know it's not what we have here, but this is mozzarella cheese.
					And the internet said that this is an okay a pretty good replacement for the original kind of
					cheese, which I obviously don't have here in the grocery store. So, we're going to use mozzarella
					and just be grateful that we have some cheese.<br>
					Okay. Bunch of cheese. Now, another layer of the dough. So, this is going to be a sweet and crunchy
					cheesy delicious dessert. And camera wife, what's my favorite dessert?
					Cheesecake.<br>
					Cheesecake. So, I'm hoping that this will be delicious because there's another dessert with cheese
					that I love.
					So, hopefully this one is as good or better.<br>
					It has something else or just that.
					So, I made a sweet syrup. I made a like a liquid sugar which has just sugar, water, and lemon. And
					after this is done cooking, you pour that on top and that's it. Super simple, super delicious. And
					that is ready for the oven. All right, guys. It is time for the moment of truth. Camera wife, can
					you show what it looks like? This is what the Makluba looks like before the final step. So, camera
					wife, what do we have to do now?<br>
					I need to take a picture of yourself.
					Okay. Take a picture for the Instagram.
					To flip it.
					To flip it. All right. This part can make you nervous.<br>
					nervous.
					Wow.
					Too perfect.
					Oh, wow.
					All right, guys. Well, it's falling apart a bit and the tomatoes kind of burnt to the bottom, but I
					tried my best. That still looks pretty delicious. So, we'll eat it like this. I made my shata hot
					sauce. And I just can't wait to get in that lamb, guys. Now, camera wife should take a picture.
					Okay, guys. Now, camera wife's already been eating all the stuff that's stuck to the bottom. Let's
					try this. I can't wait. I need to get that lamb.<br>
					That is so hot.
					The lamb is just delicious, guys.<br>
					Falling apart. All those spices make it taste so warm and good. The rice delicious. We've got We're
					going to be eating this for 2 or 3 days and I'm very happy about that. All right, guys. Now, Kum
					sent me a lot of videos. I'm going to show you those in just a minute. I just want to say the
					situation over there is very tough and I think everybody should support them in any way they can. He
					showed me that his family is cooking with very little. He told me that one day all he had to eat was
					one piece of bread. Could you imagine that?<br>
					We've got all this. I feel very grateful to have it. And even though sometimes it doesn't feel right
					eating all this, spending all this money when other people don't have it, I promise all of you that
					as the channel grows and grows, I will continue trying my best to do good in the world. And as it
					makes more money, we will try and help causes around the world. That is my promise to you guys, my
					viewers. I will always try to do the right thing on this channel.<br>
					So, as it grows, the good in the world will grow, too. All right, let's try this dessert. All right,
					guys. Our dessert is ready. This is what it looks like. So, I made a syrup, like I said, which was
					water, sugar, and lemon, and poured it all over there. Now, the final touch. Sprinkle a little bit
					of pistachios, a little bit of pistachios on top. A very traditional touch. And then let's cut in
					and see what it looks like. All right, guys. Look at that cheese. Let's see how it tastes. Got my
					buddy Connor here with me. He's going to try it in a second. Piece for the camera wife.
					Oh my goodness. You want another cheese?<br>
					Eat that. Okay, guys. It's very interesting the cheese in a dessert. But that syrup with the sugar
					and the crunchy stuff, it just works. It's one of those things that to us it sounds strange because
					we don't have anything like this, but it just works.<br>
					What do you think, camera wife?
					It is absolutely delicious.
					I probably eat this whole thing.<br>
					All right, guys. The Mac Luba was delicious. Another incredible culinary cultural experience with
					your English speaking friend Kyle. I hope that the water back there isn't too loud, but it looks
					awesome. It looks super cool. I love how this shot looks. So, I'm going to give our facts about
					Palestine right here in this spot. Okay. So, the first thing that we will share about the land of
					Palestine is that it has ancient and sacred roots. It's one of the oldest inhabited regions of the
					world and the Canaanites who lived there over 5,000 years ago are considered to be the ancestors of
					the Palestinian people. And that piece of land is also considered sacred to the three Abrahamic
					religions, Judaism, Islam, and Christianity. Next, let's talk about the struggle that the people on
					this piece of land have faced.<br>
					Palestine has endured a long history of occupation. first by the British after World War I and later
					by Israel since 1948. And to this day, Palestinians face military occupation, violence, home
					demolitions, and loss of their land. The last thing that Kotum wanted me to share was the cultural
					symbols of their identity. For example, the olive tree symbolizes resilience, their traditional
					embroidered dress, and the black and white cafia for resistance. Another fact as we mentioned
					earlier is that this is a sacred land for Jews, Christians and Muslims and why the Christians
					consider this sacred land is because it is widely recognized as the birthplace of Jesus Christ. Okay
					guys, and last I want to say where I stand on this whole thing. I do not hate anybody, but I think
					that we all need to love one another, respect one another, respect each other's rights, and because
					of the injustices that I have seen that these people are dealing with, I've chosen to support them
					in any way I can. So, once again, a shout out to any of my subscribers who are in Gaza facing these
					hard times.<br>
					Stay strong, guys. Hope you enjoyed this video. See you in the next one. And for ingredients we have
					potatoes, eggplant, two baby lemon and pepper for parcel chhatta and very strange thing is fried
					onion kept in oil. And for spices we have lemon, chili, thigh leaves, cardamom, cloves, rice spices
					and cinnamon, turmeric, black pepper, gangar and finally salt.<br>
					According to cooking, unfortunately we don't have gas here in Gaza for many months.
					So for cooking we use wood. So I'm right now sewing the wood.
					And now we are going to fry the potato the the onion. And now the spices. By the way, my mom is
					cooking right now.<br>
					And now add the rice.
					So now we will take the rice because we will put the vegetables, potato and eggplant in the bottom.
					So now we will add the vegetables like layers rice layers then vegetable layers. And now the kids
					are playing al shahid game.<br>
					And in the end of the video, uh, we thank everybody who watched the video.
					Here in Gaza, we suffering a lot of problems like starvation and access for the clean water and uh
					the uh heat of tents. Uh so don't forget us and don't forget to support us. Goodbye.
