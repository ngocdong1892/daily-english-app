					Are you ready to learn some real life English with comprehensible input? Well, good because today we
					are going to learn real English vocabulary, a little bit about Saudi Arabian culture, and we are
					going to make a dish that all of our Saudi friends have been asking me to make. Keva, chicken ksa.
					Let's go.<br>
					Hello, my friends. It is your English- speakaking friend, Kyle. Today we're going to improve our
					English with comprehensible input. What is comprehensible input? Comprehensible input is when a
					native speaker speaks slowly and clearly so that you can understand. Today guys, you can see we're
					in my kitchen again. We've got our ingredients all set up and we're going to make a dish that many
					of you have asked me to make. A Saudi Arabian dish called chicken kea. Guys, I'm excited.
					Whenever you guys tell me that you want to see me make these dishes, when I see one that looks good
					to me, I start watching videos on YouTube, learning the little tricks how to make it good. And I'm
					very excited for this one. It looks so flavorful. Camera wife and I are both very hungry and I can't
					wait. So, we're going to get going here. One thing I want to say first, guys, some of you have
					asked, "Does your wife cook for you?" And a lot of the ladies say, "Oh, you treat your wife so good.
					I love how you talk to her." I treat my wife very good because she treats me incredibly.<br>
					Guys, you only see me on the camera cooking for her, saying nice things. My wife is so good to me.
					She's making cute faces right now, guys. She comes and helps me with these videos. She does so much
					to help this channel and to support her husband. That's why I treat her so good while we're filming.
					But believe me, she takes care of me, too. All right, let's make some keza. First, we've got our
					chef knife and our knife sharpener. I am sharpening my knife.<br>
					Okay, now we've got a sharp knife. It is ow sharp. Sharp means that it can cut things easily. So,
					what we're going to cut first an onion. Ooh. You see how sharp it is? It cut that onion so easily
					because it is what? Camera wife.<br>
					Sharp.
					It is sharp. Okay. Camera wife. What happens sometimes when you cut an onion?
					You can cry.<br>
					You can cry. Now, I've seen that there's a trick to not cry when you cut an onion. I've seen that if
					you chew chewing gum while you cut an onion, you will not cry.<br>
					That's what they say. But I don't have any chewing gum, so I can't try it out.
					Guys, let me show you guys a cool way to cut an onion. You cut like this, not all the way through.
					So guys, this is an easy way to dice an onion. And to dice something means to cut it in very small
					pieces. Can you show the onion very close, baby? So you guys can see how I cut it, but it's still
					together. Now watch. Nice little pieces. This is a little chef trick to easily dice an onion. All
					right, guys. Here you can see we've got our diced onion. Here you can see that your English-speaking
					friend Kyle is crying a little bit, but it's not because camera wife is being mean to me. It's
					because the onion. So, next we need garlic. And camera wife, what is the most important thing to
					know about garlic?<br>
					No kisses.
					Don't eat garlic and then try and kiss somebody. That's important. And so guys, garlic has like a
					little paper on it, a little skin or it's like paper, but this is an easy way to get it rid of it.
					Put your knife on top and smash it. And the little paper skin stuff comes right off.
					So, we're going to use three. What are these called, wife?<br>
					I don't know.
					Cloves of garlic.
					I forgot.
					I know. Because in Spanish, they call them what?
					Teeth. Okay. So, we're going to get all the skin or paper off of these and then cut them very small.
					Just like that.<br>
					Just nice little small pieces. Okay, guys. We've got our garlic. Three cloves of garlic cut up. Now,
					we've got a tomato. I'm going to dice this tomato. I don't know any cool tricks for cutting tomatoes
					nicely.<br>
					What do you mean dice?
					Dice is like this. Dice means to cut in small pieces. So you don't say I'm going to cut this tomato.
					Well, I am cutting this tomato, but there's different ways to cut things.
					Really?<br>
					Yes.
					Wow.
					So dicing is a means that you're cutting it into small pieces like that. This is a diced onion
					because it's small little pieces. But right now, we are dicing a tomato. And now we've got our diced
					onion, diced tomato, and chopped garlic.
					All right, guys. Let me give you a little view of all the spices. This is going to be a delicious,
					flavorful dish.<br>
					We've got a ton of different spices. My wife saw these and she was like, "What is that?" This guys
					is called black limes and they're limes, but they were dried in the sun. So, they are a unique
					ingredient used in this part of the world in the cuisine. I had to order them on Amazon because they
					don't have these on the stores here. So, this is a new ingredient for us. These are a new ingredient
					for us. These are called cardamom pods.<br>
					Wait, baby, I can't see. Okay, these are cardamom pods. This is whole cumin seeds. Kuminos, right?
					Amore.
					Oh, yes.<br>
					Kuminos for for my Spanish speakers.
					This is black pepper. Here we have cinnamon, coriander.
					Wait, what are you doing? so fast I can't see it. Okay.
					Cinnamon. Here we have coriander, smoked paprika, turmeric, and ground clove. And this is what,
					wife?<br>
					Um, basil. No, no, no, no, no. I know. I know. I don't remember.
					That is a bay leaf. And all these are going to go into this same dish to make an incredible,
					delicious, flavorful dinner for camera wife and myself. And my wife saw these and she was excited.
					Raisins, guys. Up until we made the plav dish, we never ate raisins in anything, but it was so
					delicious in the plav. Now we're excited to try it in this. All right, guys. Let's get going on our
					next step.<br>
					Camera wife is smiling at me, guys.
					She's trying to flirt with me. Camera wife, what does flirting mean?
					Co.<br>
					I know in Spanish. When you want to be cute, when you see somebody who you like, you know, you see a
					guy who you think is cute or a woman who you think is attractive, flirting is like, "Hey, I like
					you. You want to come eat some kebabs with me?" Let me tell you people, learn how to cook, people
					are going to start flirting with you, okay? Because everybody wants to eat good food. All right,
					guys. This is a pot. This is called a pot. And we are heating up our pot right now on my stove.
					We've got our chicken here, guys. I bought some awesome chicken from the farm, the local farm that I
					like to support, which is going to be absolutely delicious. This is called a cabinet. And we can
					open cabinets. Going to get some olive oil out. Put the olive oil in the pot. And you need one, two,
					three gugs. Glug gug gug. That many. Okay. And first we're going to start by toasting. Toasting
					means just heating up and releasing the flavor of these the black limes, our cardamom pods. But it
					said to break them up just a little bit, to squeeze them just a little bit to squeeze them a little
					bit so the flavor can start to come out. And then our cumin. And we'll open up our drawer. This is a
					drawer.<br>
					We'll open our drawer and get a wooden spatula. Now guys, we're just going to let this go for just a
					minute until it starts to smell delicious. Starting to smell good. Camera wife, please stop flirting
					with me. I'm trying to cook.<br>
					Guys, she always flirts.
					Guys, I'm just hungry.
					Oh, she's just hungry. That's why she's flirting. Okay, so put our onion in. I'm not going to put
					all the onion, guys. It called for a lot of onion in this.<br>
					Camera wife's stomach doesn't do very good with with onion, so I'm not going to put the whole thing
					in. put our garlic in.
					I want to see you.
					Okay. Camera wife said if it's cooked, it's okay. Now, we're going to stir this up and we're going
					to let our onion and our garlic start to cook down, which means get smaller and start to smell
					delicious.<br>
					She can smell the lime. It's It's really interesting these new flavors. And guys, I'm super excited
					because I'm buying all these new spices and new ingredients that I did not have in my cabinet
					before. So now I'm becoming a more balanced chef. I know all these dishes.<br>
					So if we ever have special guests in our home, I know how to cook awesome things to impress them.
					All right, let's throw our tomato in and I will put my cutting board in the sink so the camera wife
					can wash it later. Right. Camera wife where I clean when he cooks.<br>
					Well, camera wife also work today. So we that's one thing that our relationship I really love about
					our relationship. When I have to go to work, she does most of the things at home to help me. When
					she works and I'm just at home, I try and do a little bit more to help her. And oh, that's another
					thing I wanted to say.<br>
					Men, the best chefs in all the world are men. Don't be scared to cook for your wife. Gentlemen, I
					promise. Cook a dish like this for your wife. She's gonna be flirting with you. She's gonna be
					flirting with you that night. Believe me. All right. Now, we put the rest of our spices in. And this
					is going to start getting colorful and smelling absolutely enco.
					Wow. The cinnamon smells delicious. Tastes interesting.
					like the sour cream and it's kind of sweet.
					We'll go ahead and throw our bay leaf in there. What is this? Camera life.<br>
					Open can opener.
					Can opener. I'm going to open up a uh can of tomato paste. And we're going to put two nice spoons
					tomato paste in here. And we what, wife?
					Stir.
					We stir. But there's another word, mclar.
					Mix.
					To mix. And we mix. Come over here, camera wife. Check this out. So, I just told my lovely camera
					wife, "Check this out." What does that mean, camera wife?<br>
					Come look.
					If you have something cool you want to show your friends, there's something cool over there. You
					say, "Whoa, look over there. Check that out. You got to see this." That's a very native English
					thing to say. I don't know if they would say that in Britain, Scotland, Australia, but I know for
					sure we say that very often here in the US. All right, guys. We're going to let this cook down for a
					couple minutes and then I'll show you the next step. All right, guys. Time to start cooking the
					chicken.<br>
					These are what, wife?
					Clippers.
					They're not clippers. Don't listen to the camera wife, guys. These are called tongs.
					And tongs are a very important tool in the kitchen. So, we put these right in here. Come show camera
					wife. Just like this. And we'll see if we can fit them all, but we might have to do a couple
					different batches. We'll see. And once we're done, I'll show you guys all the different kinds of
					pieces of chicken and what they're called because that's important. Smelling good. All right, guys.
					This is what it's looking like right now. I'm going to let that cook for a little bit. Let all those
					flavors get in the chicken and then we'll show you the next step. See you in a minute.<br>
					All right, guys. It's been cooking for a few minutes. All those flavors are getting into the
					chicken. Looks like this right now. Oh, it looks good.
					Camera wife wants to eat it already. All right, guys. It looks like that right now. The next step,
					put water in there.
					So, we're going to take our glass here, fill it up with water, and put the water in here just until
					it covers everything up. Need a little more. Okay, guys. Now, we're going to put the lid on and let
					that cook for about 20 minutes and then I will show you the next step. Okay guys, now we're going to
					make a Saudi hot sauce. Now, if I had to guess how it's pronounced, I would say shata. I hope that's
					right. Shata. It's a spicy pepper sauce. And that is what we're going to make today. So, we've got
					our ingredients here. Going to use two of these chilies. Two of these chili peppers. And give me a
					second, guys. I'm going to wash them so camera doesn't yell at me. Okay, guys. These are the Serrano
					peppers. And these are for heat to be spicy. This is a red bell pepper.<br>
					It's going to give it a nice color. and make it a little sweeter. So, let's start with our serranos.
					We'll cut the stems off. These, this part is called stems. And then we will just cut these like
					that. And then the red bell pepper.<br>
					So guys, let me tell you something about peppers. These little seeds here. If you're using a spicy
					pepper, a spicy pepper like sranos, jalapenos, Thai chilis, the seeds will make it spicier.
					Okay? So, you're going to want the seeds if you like spicy stuff. These ones that are not spicy, you
					don't want the seeds.<br>
					You just want this part. So, this is a cool way to cut bell peppers. Cut it like that. And you throw
					the seeds away, the whole thing like that. And you're left with just the part that you want.
					So, we will just cut these up a little bit. Doesn't have to be perfect because we're going to blend
					them up anyway. But just to make it a little bit easier to blend, we'll cut them up like that.
					Okay. And then some tomato for a little bit of liquid and a little bit more flavor. Okay. So, we'll
					put all of our ingredients in a bigger bowl here. And then we need some lemon juice as well.
					And I'm just doing this so that the seeds the seeds of the lemon don't fall into our shat if that is
					how it is even said. I hope that's how it's pronounced.<br>
					Tell me guys if I said it okay. Camera wife, are you gonna try the hot sauce?
					Just to try.<br>
					Just a little bit.
					I think it' be so spicy for me.
					All right, guys. So, we've got our peppers, tomato, and the juice from a half a lemon. We're going
					to put a little bit of olive oil in there. And this is my immersion blender, and it blends
					everything up. So, let's see if we can get this blended up.<br>
					All right, guys. Our shata is done and it looks like that. I made a mess everywhere. Making a mess
					is when you make things dirty. You have to clean up a mess. So, let's see if this is good.
					Too spicy. Not spicy enough. Oo, spicy.<br>
					All right. Just need some salt.
					So, what are you supposed to do with that?
					You put this right on top of the keza and eat it. But I think you only need a little bit. We're
					going to put a little bit more lemon in there to try and cut some of that spice down. Now guys, I
					know your mom, your grandma, your aunt, they probably make kept different and they probably make
					this sauce different.<br>
					This is Kyle's version, okay? So don't tell me. Don't tell me, "No, you don't use lemon. You use
					vinegar." Well, I use lemon. I'm watching you Saudis. Okay? I know you Saudis were getting ready to
					type in the comments, "No, not lemon.
					Vinegar." Kyle uses lemon. Okay? All right, my Saudi Arabian friends. Don't try that with me. All
					right. Put some more lemon in there. See how it tastes.
					Much better. All right, guys. We're going to put our hot sauce in the refrigerator and I'll see you
					in a few minutes. Okay, guys. Let's learn some interesting facts about the country of Saudi Arabia.
					This first fact is interesting. There's a part of it that is not very nice, but the other part is
					nice. So until 2018, Saudi Arabia was the world's only country where it was illegal for women to do
					what? Wife?<br>
					Vote?
					Drive.
					But in 2018, the good news is they passed a law allowing women to drive. So now our Saudi Arabian
					lady friends can drive. Speaking of driving in Saudi Arabia, Saudi drivers have developed an
					interesting sport known as sidewalk skiing. This is sidewalk skiing. And somehow they balance their
					car to drive on two wheels almost sideways. There must be some pretty good uh drivers in Saudi
					Arabia. Oh, I know what it is.<br>
					They let the women start driving and then they started doing that. That's why they didn't want the
					ladies driving because that's how they drive, right, wife?<br>
					That's crazy.
					Just kidding, guys. My wife's actually a pretty good driver. Next interesting fact about Saudi
					Arabia. Saudi Arabia is the birthplace of the world's second oldest religion. Do you know what that
					is, wife? Islam. And in fact, Saudi Arabia is home to the two most important Islamic shrines in the
					whole world. the two most important places in the whole Muslim culture. And those two places are
					Mecca and Medina. And Mecca is the holy city, what they call it, the holy city where the prophet
					Muhammad was born in around the year 570 AD. And Medina is the second holiest place in all of Islam.
					And it is the second holiest place because that is where the body of the prophet Muhammad was
					intombed or buried. And Mecca is home to one of the world's the whole world the world's largest
					annual gatherings. Every year over 2 million Muslims make a pilgrimage. Making a pilgrimage means
					that they go, it doesn't matter where they're at in the world, they go to this spot. And every
					capable adult Muslim is expected to make this pilgrimage at least one time in their lives. The last
					interesting fact about Saudi Arabia for today is that the entire country of Saudi Arabia does not
					have something in it. What is it, wife? She has no idea, guys. That's not a fair question. It does
					not have any rivers, making it the largest country in the whole world that does not have rivers. All
					right, guys.<br>
					Let's get back to finishing up this delicious chicken ka. Okay, guys. Time for the next step. Camera
					wife, show how this is looking right now. This could be a delicious stew. It's almost like a Saudi
					Arabian son co. So guys, this dish is not a stew. It's not a soup. So what we're going to do is take
					the chicken out, each piece. And you know what? Let me tell you guys about the pieces while we're at
					it.<br>
					Oh, that's a great idea.
					This is a chicken wing. That's the chicken wing. And that's actually a very popular piece of the
					chicken here.<br>
					People love to fry those up, put different sauces on them, eat them with French fries. I like to dip
					them in ranch dressing. This is the bodybuilder's best friend. This is the chicken breast. Okay, the
					chicken breast.
					Chicken breast. Okay, and I said bodybuilder's best friend. A bodybuilder is a guy like this lifts a
					bunch of weights. I said it's the bodybuilder's best friend because that is the piece with the most
					protein, has the least amount of fat and the most amount of protein. So, professional bodybuilders
					eat chicken and rice all day long. Next, we've got this here, which we call the drumstick. We call
					that the drumstick, but really it's the leg, guys. That's the leg of the chicken. And camera wife's
					favorite piece. She calls these muslos, but we call that chicken thigh.<br>
					That's a chicken thigh. This part right here. And that's probably my favorite piece, too. So, camera
					wife has good taste. So, we're going to take all the pieces out. Okay, guys. This is just plain
					white rice that I rinsed off underwater, and that's going in. And Kevsa is a rice dish, so this is
					probably the most important part. And guys, you know what? I saw a lot of videos that you can make
					keva with chicken or with lamb, and I kind of wanted to make the lamb because camera wife and I have
					been obsessed with lamb lately. So tell me guys in the comments which one's better. Is lamb ketoso
					better or is the chicken better? Because the lamb looked incredible. But from what I saw, people
					usually use the lamb for special occasions such as weddings because it's more expensive. So this
					from what I read anyway is what you'll find more likely on a normal day in a normal Saudi home with
					a family. not rich people, just normal people like us trying to live their life and feed their kids.
					So, that's what we wanted to make today. Now that we've added the rice, we got to put our raisins
					in. Put our raisins. And that's going to be a delicious little sweet touch. And then one raisin for
					the camera wife. And then we've got some carrots here, guys. I bought these because they were on
					sale.<br>
					On sale means that they're cheaper than normal. You pay less money because in a couple of days
					they're not going to be good anymore. So I bought them to save a little bit of money. I saved 30
					cents.<br>
					Yeah, I'm making this face because I need camera wife to record and she's over there playing games.
					Okay, guys. When I say she's playing games, that doesn't mean she's literally playing games like
					chess or checkers. It means she's not doing what she's supposed to be doing.
					Quit playing games, camera life. All right, guys. We have carrots. And we're going to put some
					carrots in here. Let's say that much.<br>
					Yummy.
					And then we stir. I'm going to put the lid back on the pot. Turn the fire down to low. And then
					we're going to broil this chicken. So guys, on the bottom down here, this part is called the
					broiler. Let me see the camera. And inside the broiler is fire. So, what the broiler does is it's
					very hot and it's going to make the skin crispy. It's going to give it some color and make it look
					delicious. It's just going to make this chicken look way better. So, this is what the chicken looks
					like before broiling. I'm going to broil it and I'll show you guys what it looks like in a minute.
					All right, guys. This is what it looks like after it's been broiled. You can see the skin got
					crispy. The color just looks so much better. Broiled or grilled chicken looks a lot better than when
					you boil it. So, we're letting the rice finish cooking. I'm just going to put it in the oven so
					it'll stay warm. Soon as the rice is done, I'll show you guys the next step. We are almost there,
					guys.<br>
					And I can't wait. Camera wife is very hungry, too. We're excited. Okay, guys.
					Time to make a traditional drink that might be served in a Saudi household with this dish. Once
					again, guys, I don't know if I'm saying it right. I don't speak Arabic. Laban. Laban. It's a yogurt
					drink and I'm excited to try it.<br>
					I think it's going to go so good with all those spices and especially with that hot sauce. So, what
					we need a half a cup of plain yogurt and then one4 cup water. Maybe a little I'll make my own
					recipe, guys. Okay. And this is completely optional, but I'm going to put a little bit of mint in
					there just to make it a little fresher. Just a little bit of mint. And then traditionally, you put
					salt. So, we are going to put some of my good s French sea salt. About that much. I hope it's not
					too salty. Maybe that might be too salty.<br>
					Yeah.
					One thing to remember about cooking, guys, you can always add more, but you can never take it back
					out. So, start with a little bit of salt and add more if you need to. But if you put way too much
					salt, can't do anything about it.<br>
					And then we'll stir this up. I've seen a lot of people use blenders, so I hope this will mix good
					with just a spoon.
					Looks like it's blending good. First time trying laban.
					The simple, just easy.<br>
					Very easy.
					I think it's good.
					Tastes like kafir. Tastes just like kafir. And I love kafir.
					Yeah, it's good.
					So, I'm going to put this in the refrigerator. Keep it cold until our dish is done. Almost there,
					guys. Just wait. All right, guys. Our rice is done.<br>
					Our chicken is done. Now, we have to plate the dish. Okay guys, my camera died. I was trying to say
					it's important for me to plate the dish, make it look nice. That is our Saudi Cupsa. Camera wife
					cannot wait. I cannot wait. Okay, guys. Got my yogurt drink, Laban, I think it's pronounced. We've
					got our hot sauce. We've got our kabsa. I just washed my hands really good. Why wife?
					Why did I just wash my hands very good?<br>
					Because you're going to eat with your hands. I'm going to eat this the traditional way. See if it
					tastes better that way. Traditionally, they might even be sitting on the floor, a whole group, a
					whole family, surrounding a big dish of this and eating with just their right hand. So, that's what
					we're going to try today. Oh, get a little bit of the rice.<br>
					Look at that, guys. those flavors, that spice. It's warm and delicious.
					I'm going to try another piece. Yeah.
					Can't use the left hand, but I'm going to try it with a little bit of the sauce.
					Appreciate every single one of you for spending your time with me, for sharing your culture with me
					by recommending these dishes. I hope that I did it justice. Doing something justice means you did a
					good job and you didn't disappoint the people watching. So guys, I hope I did this delicious dish
					justice.<br>
					Camera wife is waiting. She can't wait to try hers. I will see you in the next
					<br />
