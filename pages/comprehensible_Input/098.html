					hello my friends hello again today I bring you guys another intermediate video this is Ingrid she's
					going to talk to us in English some of you guys already know who she is and if you want to know how
					she found her way back into my life we made a video on patreon talking about what happened in our
					relationship so if you guys want to know go subscribe to patreon right now there's an option on
					patreon to do a seven day free trial okay so you could get a whole lot of content I'll put a link
					down below okay English what are we going to talk about today so I was on our prayer for two years
					and for a long long time I want to talk about this because I feel like so many people they they
					don't know what is the real life like as an offer so I would like used to share a little bit about
					my experience it's a very unique experience I think yeah so and maybe somebody will see this who was
					thinking about doing this program and yes they'll learn the truth about it what it's really like
					yeah right and for everybody else it's just some good English good English practice you could watch
					somebody who learned English here and get some inspiration it's not perfect so wow nothing's perfect
					but she has improved so much in these last two years so we've got some questions that I'm going to
					ask her and she's going to tell us so we could learn some more about what it was like to be an au
					pair here and if you guys don't use the word au pair in your country it's a French word but um it
					means somebody who lives with a family and takes care of their children okay so how much did it cost
					you how much money did you spend in Colombian pesos in the process of coming to the USA for this
					program how much did it cost depend me Jonas Jonas for being more like oh yeah clear 10 million
					pesos Colombian pesos is that a lot wow yes okay it is no I mean for me it was a lot all right yeah
					how did you earn that money I know I don't I hear so I went to the bank and they um how would you
					say that give you a loan yeah give me alarm and then I pay when I was working here so every mom or
					every three months I pay some and you paid that to the agency the au pair agency right yeah okay and
					then they set up everything with your work visa and all that okay so how was the process at the
					agency really long take me two years to to come here from when I start it was two years after I come
					but just depends of everyone because I was starting photography so I couldn't come before or I mean
					I don't I didn't want to so yeah take me two years but so they do like interviews um and I couldn't
					pass the interviews so because my English wasn't good you had to speak in English there oh sorry
					yeah seriously where you want to be open what you want to do there where you want to go or you know
					these kind of questions like really easy questions but at that time I couldn't speak anything so I
					tried but it was like really confused like I couldn't understand but it wasn't they was asking me um
					yeah like that kind they ask you they have do you have interviews and then it's like a process with
					papers and you know okay that kind of yeah so who is in charge of protecting you uh when you get
					here setting you up with the families and making sure that you're all safe here I like almost
					everyone is women no man um so they when you come with the family they have to be like around and
					saying like hey guys is everything okay with the family but also with the helpers but for be honest
					they are no good I don't think they do um a good job sometimes because I was lucky to have a good
					one she really worried about me to really worry about the family and I think that's fair because she
					can't be just in one side you know but what happened with another ones with my friends uh it was for
					example like hey I don't feel comfortable here they they don't want to buy the food that I like just
					saying they are vegan and I want to eat meat you know and that's really normal I don't think that's
					weird and they should buy it for them uh but they don't want to and so many times these people estas
					mujeres should be like oh I want to go and talk to you and the family you know we can fix it but
					sometimes they they don't do it uh and this is just a simple example but sometimes have like so many
					crazy things happen and they don't do anything about it that can be dangerous yeah definitely they
					bite and like crazy okay what was the hardest most difficult part of being an au pair um yeah I
					think living living with a family because you have to you have to explain everything and I'm not
					saying that's a bad thing is just sometimes the family respect you like a grown-up but sometimes not
					I can't say that that happened to Me Maybe with the first host family that was crazy um I have to
					say everything who with like everything so you're gonna go who are you going with and I understand
					that's okay because we are here alone and if something happened to us they need to know where you
					are where you were you know but I'm talking about like more different situations that's like privacy
					you know um or they don't just communicate that they don't treat you treat you like a grown-up and
					that's so bad you like their property their slave yeah it's that first one yeah so right and your
					experience as an odd pair what was the thing that you enjoyed the most oh wow traveling traveling
					within sometimes was crazy but at the end of that program I'm so red for because I I went to so many
					places I see so many places beautiful places um we traveled all over the place with that family yeah
					that was a really good experience and also um to learn English because I was living with them so
					they was really patient with me they were really patient with me thank you um I'm trying to improve
					these little things are still saying like around um so I'm so grateful for that that was amazing
					experience you know they were super they were so patient [Music] um so yeah they just plan me oh no
					you don't say that you say this that was awesome yeah helped you a lot what do you think that the
					the agencies should change for the all pair program how could they make it better what could they
					add um I think they should we should have a commonalities and like a support system support system
					yeah even when we get sick so I I don't have to say that it was bad to me but so many outputs they
					don't have that support we have insurance but sometimes sometimes not they tell us you can go to the
					Doctor Joseph you are like bleeding if you broke your arm use that you can't go if you have your
					tonsils like or you have I don't know like simple things but you need to go to the doctor to check
					if it's everything okay but we couldn't and then I really get sick one day and I was like I don't
					care and I started calling my insurance and they say yes you can come and I was like why no so so
					that was like I don't know um by the psychologists I think because so many of us we have like um
					difficult time you're away from your family yeah sadly people you can't express a lot of you know
					the girls are they're learning English and some of them speak really well but they can't they don't
					have somebody who can they they can speak to in Spanish or whatever their language is so right it's
					hard being around a bunch of people that don't speak your language you can't tell them exactly
					what's wrong and when we have problems with a family or issues or how we want to call it that but
					when we have something going with the family and everything is going no good we really feel like
					stuck you know because we live with them if you talk to them you feel like they can get mad to you
					and you are not feeling comfortable going to eat like it's so difficult and yeah imagine guys
					wherever you work you live there okay you live with your boss you live with at your job yeah that's
					really uh what is something good that you learned what did this experience teach you um I think to
					communicate when you don't like something you don't have to hold it and this is no with them but I I
					learned with them a lot do you see because we have a lot of things you know understanding
					misunderstanding assuming assuming that they know they are thinking something that and they wasn't
					you know they weren't they weren't they weren't they weren't they were not they weren't um so yeah
					things like that I learned with them so we we have to sit down and talk like like adults and say
					okay I don't feel comfortable with these and and that's really uncomfortable I remember being there
					and they were like they were uncomfortable and I was but at the end everyone was happy you know we
					fits it right yeah yeah when you when you have a problem and you're upset about something it's
					important to get it out and make sure people know about it because like you said you're thinking
					that they should know but they're thinking something completely different yes what is it like to
					live with an American family um yeah okay is is kind of fun and weird so you know good and and funny
					things or weird for us like they have different um Customs Customs so they have a different Customs
					Customs Customs so when I come all Customs no no I don't know and um like eat of the time where they
					ate uh you don't have to but I want to be part of the family you mean I mean like share with them
					and I really like it um I ate every night with them when I was living within and that was like the
					time when we talked about something different and then work you know like how was your I don't know
					your day with your friends or something um and that's how for me is that's how you build your
					relationship with the host families but sometimes doesn't it's not like that for every host family
					and every outfit sometimes their families they don't like to eat with the outputs and the outputs
					they don't want to spend time with them so ah it's very difficult some people don't want to be
					around them when they're not working they won't have their alone time which I I can understand me
					too yeah how is your relationship with the children that you took care of so I was the first sign I
					was with a family from India um and then I switched two months later for American family so the
					first um it was just a girl and she she was good she was cute but she have like a big like a temper
					temper temper temper she got angry yeah and it was I don't know it was not I was not close with her
					it was short time but doesn't that smart if it was sure or a long time it was I don't know connected
					with it I don't feel comfortable with that family and neither with the kid yeah and then with the
					family after they have three kids I mean four but three kids that I have to take her take her off
					and that was amazing I mean it was it was great the the Leo boy he's three years old now but when I
					come to the family he was 18 months I think or 16 months so he was my baby and he's still being my
					baby but he's big now um I just love him so much like so much and he loved me that's great so even
					after you're done working with that family you still have a relationship with them yeah I still like
					busy busy visit them um going to their house and stay over the night and you know sometimes they're
					good people I like them too I met their family too and they're very very nice people they were super
					nice to her they treated her like family and they were even really nice to me so it's a good family
					um okay so for the last question when you were here doing all this what was the thing that you
					missed most about Colombia um wow um it was no like country like oh I want to be in my country it
					was maybe the food and being so frustrated about the language so I think food it was a big deal and
					I think I said I I said I said this in an other video because I love to eat we're gonna go eat and
					after this video and uh yeah but now I'm like okay you know because now I can make my own food and
					it's okay it's still being weird sometimes like while you're eating sandwich or lunch or but I do
					too so because it's easy or quick okay yeah yeah interesting I want to say something um so I really
					think in my opinion that the agencies should say should be more truly you say true honest honest
					honest about the program um because there is so many things that they don't they didn't they don't
					say I mean I mean to make her like oh this is amazing this is the best thing that you can do with
					your life right now and can be but can be not so just one one more last thing if there's somebody
					watching this who is thinking about doing this program do you recommend that they do it or do you
					think there are better ways that you could learn English come here travel um I don't regret no you
					don't regret I don't regret I don't regret about being out for two years like these two years um but
					I can't say like it's 50 and 50 of me want to say no and yes it's how I say there is a lot of good
					things that you can see that you can learn that you can enjoy you know for your life uh but also
					there's like 50 percent that can be bad and you have to just know but yeah I think I recommend it
					you have just to be like no that can happen you have to be aware that these things can happen where
					is that where aware is to know okay you're aware of a possibility yeah okay so yeah can be possible
					to live to have a bad experience um but that's why I say we need um Community Support or oh my God
					yes uh support system support system because if that happened you have someone to who can help you
					and you switch family and that's okay you know it's not easy mentally is like really hard you can
					have a difficult times um so many of us we have um come up so be depressed be depressed anxiety we
					have anxiety and nobody knows even the family you don't want to go and say the family where you are
					working if you are so depressed because you guys are being I don't know weird or is so difficult
					[Music] but but yeah I would say are you happier now after this is all done than you were back in
					Colombia before you started all this yes yeah of course so you feel like you're in a better place in
					your life now yes absolutely so there were hard times but those Hard Times taught you so much right
					yes guys it's totally true okay I know the same person that I learned a lot I feel like I grew up
					like like a person you know turn into an adult yeah yeah all right guys hope you guys got some good
					English out of this and if any of you are interested in being an au pair maybe you learned something
					about the process that you didn't know to help you make that choice
