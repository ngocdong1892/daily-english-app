					guys already know you know that here in my channel pensando English my mission is to bring you guys
					real English real English that you can understand okay to help you with your English and in my
					channel I share my stories with you share my experiences share my thoughts share my feelings okay I
					share everything here with you guys so today I am going to share the good things and the bad that
					have happened in my life in 2022 okay and I want to talk about something that is a little bit deep
					okay profundo something that's a little bit deep that I've been thinking a lot about lately so when
					people say oh those things go hand in hand it means that these two things always go together okay
					things go hand in hand when they go together okay so I've been thinking a lot lately about how the
					good things in life and the bad things in life they go hand in hand okay and every good thing
					there's a little bit of bad and in every bad thing there's something good okay most important thing
					is that we are learning from all of our experiences okay the good ones and the bad ones so today I'm
					going to share the three biggest things the three biggest things that have changed in my life in
					2022 this year okay first I want to remind you guys that if you want to be part of the channel you
					can send me your videos here send me a short video of you speaking in English Okay I love it when
					you guys send me those videos and I'll put them in a video in the future so you can show show your
					English to everybody else okay so send me your videos here okay the second reminder is that I just
					started a patreon page okay and on my patreon page for four dollars a month you'll get four new
					videos one video every week but these are not videos like this in these videos I talk about things
					that are that I would not talk about on YouTube okay so the video the one video that's on there now
					is Miss experiences and I talk I talk about some deep things okay and that's what I'm going to do
					each week I'm going to talk about my Emma's Deli Callas okay yeah I'm going to talk going to talk
					about the things that have changed in my life in this year okay the first thing that has changed in
					my life big time this YouTube channel okay this YouTube channel has grown grown grown grown and
					we're still growing okay right now we have 1 200 something subscribers but every day it's growing a
					little bit okay and I know that next year next year we're gonna blow up okay and in a few days I'm
					going to make another video about my goals for the channel in 2023 so I'll talk about my plans for
					the future of the channel in that video but some really cool things some really cool things have
					happened with the YouTube channel this year okay so I have been working working working okay I've
					been making so much content every week I've been doing three videos and something really cool
					happened when I started to make those three videos and it shows me okay it shows me that when you
					work hard you get the benefits okay that's how the universe works you put in the work you get the
					rewards Okay so two days after I started making three videos each week Mr Salas he made a video
					about YouTubers who deserve more subscribers okay I know that a lot of you guys came here from
					seeing that video so that was really cool that was really cool and wow there there's so many people
					that make YouTube channels about languages but it was so cool when that happened and the channel has
					been growing growing growing ever since so we're gonna keep on going keep on growing I'm gonna keep
					on bringing you guys quality English content you guys keep on watching stick with me stick with your
					English okay keep on going my friends because here we do not quit Okay we don't quit the second
					thing that I want to talk about this year that makes me think makes me think deeply Pro fundamente
					it makes me think deeply uh my father he died this year okay now that makes me think a lot makes me
					think because yeah that's bad it's bad but something good also came from it okay and it's weird it's
					strange it's throttle to think that something good can come from a death but for many years many
					years me and my father we were not close Okay we did not speak for a lot of time we we had a lot of
					problems in our relationship okay I had a lot of anger okay anger ravia towards my dad and when he
					got sick and he was in the hospital and the doctor said that he was going to die it's like all of
					that anger went away okay it went away and I did something that I have not been able to do in the
					way podido been able to do in 15 years okay I forgave my father and that is something very good I
					don't have that anger in my heart anymore and when my dad was about to pass away he put his hand out
					and held my hand and I knew he could not talk he could not talk but he looked at me and he held my
					hand like that and I knew he was telling me that he's sorry that he loves me that he's proud of me
					so my father passed away this year that's a big change but something good came from it I released a
					lot of anger that was in my heart okay and I forgave my father and in the patreon episode I talk a
					lot about why me and my father had a lot of problems Okay the third thing that has changed very much
					in my life this year and that has made me think once again that the good and the bad they go hand in
					hand so the good is that this year I got to spend a lot of quality time happy time special moments
					with somebody who I loved who I loved with all my heart okay um a lot of you guys have seen the
					videos with myself in Ingrid okay uh you might have seen where I proposed will you marry me to her
					okay I made a video about that and these were some very special times in my life very happy times we
					went to Puerto Rico together that was awesome that was one of the best things I've ever done in my
					life I have never never even thought about asking another woman I never never wanted to have ask a
					woman to marry me what this year I asked Ingrid to marry me and when she said yes it was a very
					happy time very happy time um and we had a wonderful relationship and we had some wonderful times
					together this year now this also makes me think good and bad go hand in hand but there are lessons
					to be learned okay I alexiones and todos so the bad and listen listen excution okay I am not going
					to talk bad about her okay I loved her and there's still a lot of love in my heart for her but sadly
					we broke up and um it was a it was a really hard experience for me because I thought I thought we
					were going to get married I thought we were going to be together forever and build a life Santi so
					um it was difficult for me because yeah there were times where it was hard sometimes we could not
					see each other very often but I loved her very much and when I was with her we were so close there
					was so much love okay and it was amazing but things change I guess okay and the hardest part for me
					is she she told me that she is not ready to be a mother to my son um and I can understand that
					because she is younger than me I am 32 she is 26. so I have lived more and maybe she is not ready
					for something that serious but I thought she said yes to marry me so it was a surprise when she said
					she did not think that we could be together um and maybe I'll never know why maybe I will never know
					the real reason I don't know maybe she's having hard times in her life okay maybe she's having
					problems that she did not want to talk about so it was difficult for me but it was also Lessons
					Learned and I'm going to tell you guys I'm going to tell you guys something that I am not proud of
					okay ah the day that it happened the day that it happened and we split I drove home uh and I said I
					texted I sent a message and I said some mean things I said some horrible things to her okay and I'm
					not proud of that because that is not me I am somebody who is positive but I'm also a human and I
					was feeling a lot of pain in my heart a lot of pain a lot of tristessa sadness okay so sometimes
					when humans are hurt when we are hurt sometimes we hurt other people so that they feel the way that
					we feel inside and it is not right it's bad so um I said some very mean things to her I hope I hope
					that she knows that I did not mean it okay I was just hurt I was hurt um and if she sees this
					increbles so my friends the Deep part profunda is that good and bad go together when the good
					experiences happen sometimes there's something bad that goes with them when things bad things are
					happening Something Good Can Happen you could be learning from it okay and I have grown and learned
					so much this year okay today I am not I am not the same person that I was in January of this year
					not even close when I look in the mirror I don't even recognize myself okay my mindset is so
					different and I am so ready for the future so my friends today's assignment I want you guys to tell
					me in English tell me down below in the comments in English tell me how your life how your life has
					changed okay my friends I hope that this video was useful for you guys I hope that you guys are
					having a wonderful wonderful day keep on going with your English I'll keep on going with the
					contentremos pronto
