					meet you too Kyle what do you like to do for fun in Indiana well I make YouTube videos where I teach
					Spanish speakers how to improve their English that's awesome Kyle how long have you been making
					YouTube videos oh about 3 years now I really enjoy doing it and it feels good to help people that's
					great to hear do you have a favorite topic or type of video that you enjoy making the most yes I
					really like to make videos with valuable life lessons because I think if we can make videos that can
					help people to improve their English and learn important things that can help improve their life at
					the same time that's some very valuable content that sounds fantastic Kyle combining language
					learning with life lessons is such a meaningful approach it sounds like you have a lot of passion
					for what you do what's the most rewarding part of making these videos for you well I really enjoy
					knowing that the time that I spend to make these videos is helping people to improve something that
					is very important in their lives such as a new language that's really inspiring Kyle helping people
					achieve their goals is such a fulfilling experience have you received any memorable feedback from
					your viewers yes I have and I have even made some videos where I have spoken with some of my viewers
					and it was incredible to see them face to face and have a real life conversation with them in
					English that must have been an amazing experience to connect with your viewers directly like that
					how did those conversations go they went very well and the thing that I found most incredible was
					how cool each of them has been each one of them had something special to offer to add to the
					conversation they have incredible Hobbies they have incredible points of views they were some of the
					best conversations I've ever had it sounds like those conversations were really enriching and
					rewarding for you it must be wonderful to see the impact your videos have on people's lives
					firsthand yes it is so tell me what do you like to do for fun I enjoy learning about new topics

					what languages are you currently learning besides English well I'm fluent in Spanish although I try
					and improve every day and I also speak a bit of French and I have studied some Portuguese that's
					impressive being fluent in Spanish and learning French and Portuguese shows a strong dedication to
					languages do you have a favorite language learning method or resource I think that a method known as
					comprehensible input is an incredible way to learn a language have you heard of comprehensible input
					yes comprehensible input is a method where Learners are exposed to language that is understandable
					and just slightly above their current level helping them to acquire language naturally it's a
					popular approach in language teaching what do you find most effective about using comprehensible
					input in your learning and teaching well the most important thing is that it is fun it can be made
					fun when people create content such as the videos that I make that are entertaining funny and it is
					so much more enjoyable than studying a book about grammar absolutely making learning enjoyable and
					engaging can make a big difference in how effectively you learn a language it sounds like your
					videos combine entertainment with learning which is a great way to keep viewers motivated and
					interested okay so tell me me do you like to read yes I enjoy reading what kind of books do you like
					to read Kyle I like to read books that can improve my life that can teach me about history finances
					better relationships or improving my health can you recommend me any books about those topics sure
					for improving relationships the five love languages by Gary Chapman is highly recommended for
					personal finance Rich Dad Poor Dad by Robert k is popular and for health the blue zones by Dan
					Whitner explores lifestyle factors contributing to longevity these books cover a range of topics
					that might interest you very good I've read two of those books that's great have you found them
					helpful in your journey of personal growth and learning yes I have I think that reading books is an
					incredible way to learn from both the mistakes that other people have made and also the things that
					they have done that have been successful absolutely books provide valuable insights and wisdom from
					others experiences it's like having access to a wealth of knowledge and learning directly from
					experts and their stories exactly do you have a favorite book I don't have personal preferences but
					many people enjoy Classics like to Kill a Mocking Bird or Pride and Prejudice what's your favorite
					book H I think that my favorite book that I have read before is Think and Grow Rich do you know it

					success principles and mindset what did you find most impactful or insightful about it well it
