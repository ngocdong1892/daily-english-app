					Did you know that depending on where you are in the United States the accent can be so different
					that it almost feels like you're in a different country today we are going to explore some of these
					very different accents that you can find all around my country the United States let's start with
					Boston and who better to show us the Boston accent than an American hero and one of the most popular
					presidents that we have ever had here in the United States John Fitzgerald Kennedy better known as
					JFK I appreciate your president having made me an honorary visiting professor and I will assure you
					that my first lecture will be very brief I am delighted to be here so my friends as you can see in
					Boston they don't say they ours okay that sounded way more Australian than Boston I'm sorry about
					that guys really I'm sorry so the Boston accent comes from a Colonial Roots heavily influenced by
					early British settlers and it retains some old English pronunciation such as dropping the RS at the
					end of the words and adding RS in places that they don't necessarily belong such as in the word idea
					a person with a heavy Boston accent might say idear idear that's the right idea guys my Boston
					accent is terrible we'll see if I could do some of these other accents better sorry in advance next
					the New York City accent the New York City accent has a mix of Dutch German Italian and Irish
					influences due to the many waves of immigration in the 19th and 20th centuries it's known for its
					unique nasal sound and fast-paced speech here's an example ain't no reason to test it but I'll let
					yall enjoy it for a second coffee cost the quarter on the corner I'm a New Yorker and I drink coffee
					guys that was awful that was awful next the southern draw Southern draw this accent is associated
					with the Deep South and you can find it in states such as Georgia Alabama and Mississippi and these
					deep Southern Accents stem from British Scottish Irish and even African linguistic influences and
					the draw refers to the long stretched out vow sounds anyway here's an example I was riding along
					this morning minding my own business in my little truck when my windows rolled down and I stopped at
					a red light and a big truck pulled up behind me an 18wheeler with two men inside and as soon as the
					light turned green they went to blowing their horn at me about three times next we have an accent
					that I am actually quite familiar with the Appalachian accent this accent you will find in West
					Virginia Kentucky and Tennessee this accent is deeply rooted in Scottish Irish and English dialects
					from the 1700s now these people were very isolated in the Appalachian Mountains and for that reason
					the Appalachian English kept older English speech patterns and even some of the vocabulary for
					example using the word reckon instead of think I reckon it's going to be a nice day today I reckon I
					reckon that means I think so guys I have a lot of family from the south that live in Tennessee so I
					grew up hearing this accent and it's pretty normal to me but anyway here's an example y'all with a
					Southern accent from the Appalachian Mountains down Y in Tennessee did you get that did you get it
					hello friend hope yall doing well I just thought I'd do a little video here today it's been about 3
					months now since the end of the year hope yall doing will you next we've got the Louisiana Cajun or
					Creole accent Cajun or Creole English is influenced by the French settlers who arrived in Louisiana
					in the 18th century the accent features French based intonation and sentence structure Creole
					English mixes French English Spanish African and Native American influences it's a very distinct
					accent guys and this example that I'm going to show you might be a very strong example but I have
					seen several people speaking like this on YouTube when I went to New Orleans I did not see anybody
					speaking like this or speaking French so I imagine you have to go to the small little little towns
					way outside of the big city yes sir you wrestle them alligators I I I don't wrestle but I catch him
					you do I catch him Bo look I got a good tape in that Gator Boys for Florida matter of fact F the
					Everglades in Florida G Wars there two Wars that they the Russ alligator they rle them they go up
					under e War to catch you what do you do I shoot them next we've got the upper Northwest accent
					you'll find this in States like Minnesota and Wisconsin and the way that these people speak comes
					from the influences of the Scandinavian and German populations who settled there the influence of
					the Swedish and Norwegian created long vowel sounds making words like boat sound like boot Boot and
					phrases that are stereotypically from the region such as don't you know don't you know come from
					direct translations of Scandinavian Expressions so here's an example of the Wisconsin Minnesotan
					accent go up north in my hatchback or catch some bass and C ion that was like my goto and last guys
					we have the most most annoying the most annoying accent in all of the United States the California
					Valley Girl accent the valley girl accent developed in the 1980s it was influenced by Hollywood and
					pop culture and the rise of teenage slang or Hera in Southern California it's characterized by
					something known as upt talk which means that statements end up sounding like questions so guys I'm
					going to show you different accents from around the United States please forgive me guys please
					forgive me and something known as vocal fry where they use a low and creaky voice so I'm like from
					California and this is a fcal fry anyway supposedly it reflects the laidback Surfer lifestyle in
					California dude here's an example okay well this person can't think critically so no you can't
					really think properly then no go no go no go no go all right guys and that is just the small paste
					of all the different accents that we have around my country tell me in the comments guys which one
					is your favorite and which one do you think just sounds awes awful okay my friends
