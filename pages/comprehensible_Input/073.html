					hello my friends hello again today we are going to do part three of learning interesting facts about
					each of the United States okay this is part three there's only going to be one more part after this
					so it's going to be a four-part little series okay if you don't already know who I am my name is
					Kyle and here on my channel pensan Eng I bring you real English that you can understand and use as
					comprehensible input or input comprehens to improve your English this is an intermediate level
					English video which means that I will speak slowly and clearly so that those of you who have an
					intermediate level of English will be able to understand what I am saying all right let's get going
					the first the first state that I am going to tell you guys an interest in fact about today is New
					Hampshire okay and an interesting fact about New Hampshire is that it is the only state the only
					state in all of the United States where when you are driving you do not do not have to use a seat
					belt the seat belt okay the seat belt is the belt that you put on and click to keep you safe if you
					ah crash your car okay now in every other state you have to use your seat belt or a police officer
					can write you and give you a ticket okay and then you will have to pay money but in New Hampshire it
					is legal to drive without without using your seat belt H now a lot of people probably really like
					that but me I think you should just use your seat Bel cuz you're only going to hurt yourself so H
					some people don't like them I always just put it on all right next the next state that I'm going to
					tell you an interesting fact about New Jersey okay New Jersey and an interesting fact about New
					Jersey is that Cheerleading started in New Jersey do you know what cheerleading is okay so for an
					example at a football game the cheerleaders are the girls who who wear little clothes and they say
					you're going to win yay they cheer when the the team does good they cheer w i n Win okay they cheer
					they jump around and they be pretty all right that's a cheerleaders job to be pretty and to support
					the team all right now Cheerleading started at a very famous college or university Princeton and
					that is in New Jersey they're for or Cheerleading started in the state of New Jersey and the next
					the next state that I will tell you about today is New Mexico okay New Mexico and an interesting
					fact about New Mexico is that the first atomic bomb ever made was detonated or exploded in New
					Mexico okay and an atomic or nuclear bomb is the most powerful bomb or explosive device that mankind
					has and the one that was tested and exploded in New Mexico was the same style that the United States
					used in World War II to drop and kill thousands and thousands of people in Japan okay those same
					ones that we used in World War II against Japan they tested in New Mexico so nuclear bombs have been
					detonated on us soil but never as an attack from another country so next state that I'm going to
					tell you about is New York the state of New York now I'm sure a lot of you have seen New York City
					and TV shows or movies okay so you may already know some things about New York one thing that you
					may know is that New York is a very very very diverse place okay there are a lot of people from
					different countries from all around the world and New York is so diverse in fact that over 800
					different languages are spoken in New York and that makes New York one of the most linguistically
					meaning having to do with languages diverse places in all of the world and the first most commonly
					spoken language there is English can you guys guess can you guys guess what the second most popular
					language in New York is all of you guys know how to speak it I'll give you a hint Spanish okay first
					we have English then Spanish and then you have all the other world languages the Indian languages
					Asian languages middle eastern African all of these are spoken in New York mainly New York City okay
					the next the next state that I am going to tell you guys a very interesting fact about is North
					Carolina okay and a fact about North Carolina is that it is the state that produces the most of two
					important products and those products are sweet potatoes and I like those and tobacco I do not like
					tobacco okay but these are products that sell a lot all around the world and um North Carolina is
					the state that produces the most of it one other interesting fact is that something was invented
					there that I'm sure a lot of you especially my Mexican friends know all about and that is vix
					VapoRub okay so that Vapor Rub that your mom puts on your chest when you're sick or she makes you
					smell okay when you're sick that was made in North Carolina all right my friends next state the next
					state that I'm going to talk about North Dakota and an interesting fact about North Dakota and this
					is a fact that I am grateful for because I am using one right now is that in the year 1887 the very
					first camera was invented the first camera was invented in North Dakota and guess what the brand was
					okay I'm using a Sony it was not a Sony guess what the first brand or Marka of cameras was Kodak it
					was a Kodak okay the first camera ever invented in North Dakota was a Kodak so I'm grateful for that
					one because I use my camera almost every day next the state of Ohio okay and the state of Ohio is at
					the side at L the Indiana of my state Okay so very close I've only been there a couple times maybe
					there's some other cool things that I should explore there I don't know so something interesting
					about Ohio is that a lot of famous and important people come from Ohio okay some examples are that
					there have been seven United States presidents who were born in Ohio that's a lot okay there's only
					been 46 presidents or 46 terms of presidents okay cuz sometimes president go two terms uh there have
					been seven US presidents from Ohio and two other very famous people are from Ohio first Thomas
					Edison who is a very important inventor okay people uh say that he invented the light bulb but a lot
					of other people conspiracy theorists like myself say that he stole the idea from Nicola Tesla okay
					and another American hero Neil Armstrong who was the first man to walk on the moon however a lot of
					other people conspiracy theorists say that nobody ever went to the moon and that was a lie I don't
					know do you guys think that somebody went to the moon did astronauts go to the moon or was it fake
					tell me in a comment down below all right guys Oklahoma is the next state that I will tell you an
					interesting fact about and a fact about Oklahoma that is quite scary is that Oklahoma has the
					highest concentration which means it has the most amount of tornadoes has the highest concentration
					of tornadoes per mile anywhere in the world okay do you know what a tornado is tornado is when air
					hydrate spins like that okay a tornado can be devastating okay it could destroy houses destroy
					buildings pick up cows and cars and throw them around okay so tornadoes are scary and they're
					dangerous and in Oklahoma Oklahoma has more tornadoes per mile than any other place on planet Earth
					so think about that my friends before the next time you decide to go to Oklahoma okay think about it
					please all right guys next state Oregon the state of Oregon okay and when I first read this fact I
					was like oh no how horrible but then it gets a little better I still don't know how I feel about
					this I need to think about it a little more so in Oregon there's a law that allows people to legally
					commit suicide or decide to end their own lives okay and you go to the doctor and the doctor will
					help you he will give you a shot of a medicine that will kill you okay now when I first read this I
					was like oh no oh no because we have so many mental health problems here that a lot of people get
					depressed they're just going to go to the doctor and the doctor's going to kill them but it turns
					out that this law is only for people who have a terminal illness okay and a terminal illness means
					that you have a disease something like cancer that is going to kill you anyway okay okay so I guess
					in Oregon they think that if you're going to die and have to suffer a lot maybe some people would
					rather just end it right away and not have to suffer so I guess if you're in that position where
					you're going to suffer for a year or for eight months some people are not Fighters okay some people
					don't want to fight some people just want to end it and I can understand that okay I would rather
					fight but I can understand why someone might not want to okay so that's a wild crazy law in Oregon
					okay there are cases of legal suicide next state is Pennsylvania okay the state of Pennsylvania and
					an interesting fact about Pennsylvania is that the first Zoo a zoo is where you go to look at all
					the different kinds of animals okay it's a place where you go you pay a little bit of money and you
					could check out Bears t tigers lions Penguins all kinds of stuff okay the first zoo in the United
					States was in Pennsylvania okay and perhaps a more interesting fact is the man who made it there
					okay one of the most famous and important Americans to ever live in all of history that is Benjamin
					Franklin okay the man on the $100 bill and something interesting is that Benjamin Franklin is the
					only person to be on one of our dollar bills but never to have been a president okay he was not a
					president he was just a very important political figure one day I'll have to do a video on Benjamin
					Franklin because he is quite interesting and he did a lot of awesome things for example the zoo uh
					supposedly he brought the idea of the library to the US and he's the reason every city has a library
					things like that Benjamin Franklin has done a lot of cool stuff and the last the last one in this
					part three video the last state that I'm going to talk about is Road Island okay I'm going to tell
					you guys two little things about Rhode Island the first is that Rhode Island is the smallest state
					most chyo okay the smallest state out of all 50 states Rhode Island is the smallest one and the
					second fact is that it was home to the first circus okay the first circus in the United States took
					place in Rhode Island do you know what a circus is a circus is a place where you go and you pay a
					little money and you get to see clowns people are doing tricks with elephants and other animals and
					things like that okay they're juggling clowns are doing crazy stuff so it's like entertainment okay
					and really these days o Andia I think most people probably think that circuses are boring because
					now we have Netflix and we have YouTube okay so there's probably a lot more fun and crazy things
					that you can see then go to see some clowns but back in the day before you had any other
					entertainment the circus was probably mindblowing super cool okay all right guys that'll do it for
					today so that is the end of the video are you going to stick around are you still here okay guys
					today I'm going to do a little bonus section okay I'm going to talk a little bit more and if you
					stuck around and noticed that there's a bonus section tell me down below okay all right so what I
					want to tell you guys about is something cool that I just did today with my wife so we went and
					bought my wife a car it is her first car that she has ever had in her her whole life okay she's 28
					and she just got her first car super happy about that awesome okay my baby got her first car now I'm
					very happy for her because we've been saving money for a long time we've both been working hard
					towards this schal and it's a big uh accomplishment for her but what was cool about it today for me
					was that the guy who we bought it from only spoke Spanish okay and I talked to him I negotiated the
					prices I got us a better deal all in Spanish so I felt really really proud of myself for that okay
					I'm happy we saved a little bit of money and I'm happy that I was able to do such an important
					interaction all in my second language that makes me really proud so that got me thinking maybe soon
					I'll make a video about basic car things okay things you need to know before you drive a car here in
					the US uh how to buy a car car things like that okay basic things you need to know if you're going
					to ever have a car in an English-speaking place so I was thinking about doing that all right guys I
					hope that some of you stuck around to see this I'll be really excited if somebody noticed so please
					tell me tell me in a comment hey I saw the bonus section all right I'll be super happy but for those
					of you who stuck around I know that that means that you are one of my loyal subscribers okay who
					watches the video till the end who leaves me comments who gives me a like I appreciate you so much
