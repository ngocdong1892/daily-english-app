				<p id="1cf468a0-53d4-8123-8a89-eae5525c2921" class="">SPEAKER: Let’s say your project is to develop a
					software product.<br />During the retrospective for the last sprint, a team member says, I need to
					implement a certain feature, but I don’t have much experience building that particular
					feature.<br />Someone else on the team is an expert on that feature, so you decide to pair them up
					so
					they can work on building the feature together during the next sprint.<br />You’ve just blended XP
					and
					Scrum.<br />XP provides the basis for working in pairs from pair programming, and retrospectives are
					a
					key component of Scrum.<br />Here’s another incredibly common example.<br />Most Scrum teams I know
					use
					a Kanban board to track their progress through their sprint.<br />One word of warning,
					though.<br />Watch out for too much change in how you do things.<br />Teams work best when they can
					build up some consistency.<br />Let’s come back to Office Green.<br />As project manager of Virtual
					Verde, what types of methods might you want to use to get the project started?<br />Where would you
					blend some traditional methods and Agile methods?<br />Here are some factors to consider.<br />The
					existing plant suppliers are used to dealing with the original Plant Pell’s office delivery
					team.<br />Some of them might be interested in experimenting with an Agile approach, but not
					all.<br />In this case, you’ll want to include those vendors in discussions early on to gain buy-in
					and
					address any concerns.<br />Office Green also needs to really watch their costs.<br />So you’ll want
					to
					use traditional budget management controls to make sure they don’t go over budget on their
					program.<br />Well, that brings us to the end of this video.<br />Let’s review the key points I want
					you
					to take with you.<br />First, Agile is a mindset, a way of thinking about the project delivery
					process
					through the values and principles outlined in the Agile manifesto.<br />Second, Agile values and
					principles can be achieved through certain frameworks and delivery methods, like Scrum, Kanban, XP,
					and
					Lean.<br />And finally, Agile and Waterfall are both effective ways of approaching project
					management
					that adds specific value.<br />There are times when blending these styles will add even more value
					than
					sticking with just one, so don’t be afraid to mix things up.<br />As long as different parts of the
					project can benefit from certain processes without negatively impacting the project as a whole, go
					for
					it.<br /></p>
