					project
					closing.<br />We’ll answer the questions, what does a project closing mean, why is it important, and
					when does it occur?<br />Project closing consists of the process performed to formally complete the
					project, the current phase, and contractual obligations.<br />The first thing you should know is
					that
					completing a project is not the same thing as closing a project.<br />Just because a project is done
					doesn’t mean it’s closed.<br />In a restaurant, just because you’ve ordered your meal and finished,
					it
					doesn’t mean your dining experience is over.<br />You have to pay the bill before you
					leave.<br />It’s
					the same idea with projects.<br />So what does it actually take for a project to be
					closed?<br />There
					are three criteria that make up a project closing.<br />You’ll want to ensure all work is done,
					ensure
					that the agreed upon project management processes are executed, and get formal recognition from
					stakeholders that the project is done.<br />First, you must assure all work is done.<br />There’s a
					chance one of your tasks may have been overlooked.<br />Let’s say there was a change made that
					called
					for reprioritizing work during the project.<br />For instance, when your team completed user
					acceptance
					testing for Project Plant Pals, everything was finished and wrapped up.<br />But months later, a
					customer searches for allergy information about the plants on Office Green’s site.<br />But that
					information is nowhere to be found.<br />If you did a review before wrapping the project, you might
					have
					found that this task, creating allergy documentation, was overlooked and therefore not
					completed.<br />In doing a review of the project, you double and triple check that all work is done
					to
					avoid having to revisit the project later on.<br />Next, you must ensure that all agreed upon
					project
					management processes are executed.<br />Sometimes managerial tasks get overlooked.<br />If the task
					itself is finished, the procedural or administrative work that needs to take place afterwards might
					slip
					your mind.<br />An example might be getting contracts signed and processed.<br />It might have been
					months since the project was completed.<br />But when you revisit the contract with your plant
					provider,
					you realize that neither of you ended up actually signing it.<br />This is a crucial misstep that
					leaves
					both parties vulnerable.<br />And it’s now taking place way after the new service’s official
					launch.<br />Finally, you’ll need formal recognition and agreement that the project is complete by
					key
					stakeholders.<br />If you don’t have formal approval from all stakeholders that a project is over,
					certain stakeholders may still request adjustments to the project because they’ll think it’s still
					active.<br />This may affect various members of your team.<br />For instance, if Office Green’s
					contracted web developers believe that the project is still active, they may still be dedicating
					time
					and even billing hours of work on this project, which means wasted money for Office Green.<br />In
					the
					same way that all of the previous phases of the process, like initiation, planning, executing,
					monitoring and controlling, serve a purpose, closing serves its own equally important
					purpose.<br />Closing a project is important because it ensures that nothing has fallen through the
					cracks.<br />If a project isn’t closed, your team’s efforts, time, and credibility may be negatively
					impacted.<br />To avoid negative impacts to your team, there are a couple of different types of
					projects
					that you’ll want to know about and avoid.<br />These are the never-ending project and the abandoned
					project.<br />The never-ending project exists when, for whatever reason, the project deliverables
					and
					tasks cannot be completed.<br />This may occur when tasks are delegated to team members who don’t
					have
					the skills necessary to complete the tasks or when deadlines aren’t properly communicated– maybe
					when
					user acceptance testing yields too many non-launch blocking bugs or when your client is unsatisfied
					despite meeting their requirements.<br />Pay special attention to protecting the scope of your
					project,
					and you’re much more likely to close a project successfully.<br />If it feels like the customer
					wants
					much more from you than this project is slated to deliver, maybe the best option is to commit to a
					follow-up project and close the current one.<br />The abandoned project exists when inadequate
					hand-off
					of the project deliverables occurs.<br />Basically, the final deliverable never makes it to your
					customer.<br />It wouldn’t make sense to build a product and then not be able to market it or sell
					it.<br />Making plans to ensure an adequate handoff or transition deliverables is crucial to ensure
					customers are happy and projects are properly closed.<br />In summary, you’ll want to do everything
					you
					can to properly close a project because it may leave you on the hook for incomplete contracts,
					incomplete scope, or non-compliant practices.<br />[MUSIC PLAYING] A formal closing process is
					important
					not only because improper closing may leave you on the hook for incomplete contracts or incomplete
					scope
					but also because you want stakeholders to feel like their needs were met.<br />As we mentioned
					earlier,
					a project team’s relationship with customers, users, vendors, and so on can be impacted by loose
					ends.<br />If relationships are impacted negatively, your team’s credibility may be
					impacted.<br />Typically, stakeholders set the goals and scope of the project alongside the project
					manager.<br />So a good project manager will always want to make sure those stakeholders are
					satisfied
					with the quality of deliverables and the end product too.<br />So how can you make sure that clients
					and
					key stakeholders are happy with the project closing?<br />First, you’ll want to decide if your
					project
					warrants a small closing process at the end of each milestone or a formal and more comprehensive
					closing
					phase near the very end.<br />You may even decide to do both a small closing process at the end of
					each
					milestone and a more formal closing phase at the very end.<br />You’ll determine this by asking
					yourself
					if a particular milestone is final, meaning the milestone will not need to be readdressed at a later
					time in the project.<br />If so, having a short formal closeout will ensure that everyone is clear
					on
					the outcomes of that particular milestone.<br />For example, let’s put this in the context of the
					Project Plant Pals’ website launch.<br />Launching the website is an official milestone.<br />So
					having
					a formal closeout to the website launch might make sense.<br />Yes, there will still be ongoing
					updates
					and maintenance to the site.<br />But it won’t be launched again.<br />So the launch is a one-time
					event.<br />So you need to make sure you’re handing over deliverables, putting together the proper
					documentation, and alerting all stakeholders that you’ve reached that milestone and that that
					portion of
					the project is now closed.<br />If you decide to conduct closing processes after each phase or
					milestone, here’s what that will look like for your team.<br />First, you’ll ensure that the project
					has
					satisfied the strategic goals that it was intended to meet.<br />To begin, you’ll want to refer to
					prior
					documentation such as your statement of work, request for proposal, risk register, and RACI
					chart.<br />You’ll recall that these documents were discussed in previous sections.<br />So feel
					free to
					revisit those as a refresher.<br />While doing so, ask yourself, was all of the required work in the
					elapsed phase done?<br />Were all identified issues addressed?<br />Did every team member complete
					their
					assigned tasks?<br />Then you’ll put together closing documentation, such as creating closeout
					reports,
					which we’ll cover in depth later.<br />You’ll build and review that documentation with team members
					to
					make sure that every aspect of the project has been discussed.<br />You’ll also review notes from
					any
					retrospectives you and your team participated in.<br />This way your team members will get a chance
					to
					speak about the aspects they liked or didn’t like, and they’ll leave with a sense of
					closure.<br />Next,
					you’ll conduct administrative closure of the procurement process, close any contracts necessary,
					deliver
					the payments to vendors, and retrieve all final deliverables from contracted workers.<br />This is
					really important so that external stakeholders and contracted workers can understand that the phase
					or
					the project is officially over.<br />Then you’ll want to formally recognize the completion of the
					phase,
					if necessary.<br />Make sure all stakeholders are aware that a phase or project is ending.<br />This
					may
					be as simple as sending out an email notifying them that you’ve achieved this milestone, or it may
					warrant a larger meeting.<br />Finally, you’ll complete any necessary follow-up work.<br />This
					includes
					things like gathering final feedback and conducting closing surveys.<br />This way, you’ll
					proactively
					help stakeholders with future issues by following up and offering support.<br />If instead of
					closing
					after certain phases or milestones you’ve decided to close at the very end of your project, your
					process
					may be a little bit different.<br />Here’s what that might look like.<br />First, provide the
					necessary
					training, tools, documentation, and capabilities to use your product.<br />This includes things like
					manuals and how-to guides, which give your customers a users and understanding of how to use your
					product or service after the project is closed.<br />Next, ensure that the project has satisfied its
					goals and desired outcomes.<br />Review the project to make sure that all tasks and deliverables
					were
					completed and nothing is missing.<br />Did you accomplish what you set out to do?<br />Is the full
					scope
					of work completed?<br />You’ll also want to document acceptance from all stakeholders, like clients
					and
					sponsors.<br />Ensuring that you have written proof that stakeholders are happy with the
					deliverables
					and outcomes is very important.<br />This could be in retrospectives, a project completion document,
					or
					any other formal sign-off.<br />Then review all contracts and documentation with your project
					team.<br />This includes things like your SOW, RFP, RACI chart, risk register, and the procurement
					documents that we discussed earlier.<br />Including your whole team in this review process will help
					you
					make sure that nothing is missed.<br />Always document your lessons learned by conducting a formal
					retrospective.<br />Include your team, any other teams involved, your stakeholders, and outside
					vendors
					in this meeting.<br />We’ll go over this in more detail in the next video.<br />Finally, you can
					disband
					and thank the project team.<br />The next important step in closing a project for the stakeholders
					is
					impact reporting.<br />Impact reporting is a presentation that’s given at the end of a project for
					key
					stakeholders, which typically includes the stakeholders you had in the initial kickoff
					meeting.<br />The
					purpose of impact reporting is to demonstrate how the project went and discuss the impact of your
					product or service.<br />It’s important for the project manager because you’ll be able to
					demonstrate
					the success of your project on your terms and present the work you did to add value to the
					business.<br />In this presentation, you’ll cover how the project landed in terms of time, scope,
					and
					budget.<br />You’ll state when the new service or product launch and discuss any available feedback
					from
					users.<br />And you’ll explain how the desired outcomes were achieved.<br />Now you know more about
					how
					stakeholders and customers can get a clear understanding that your project is closed.<br />We’ve
					discussed why that’s necessary, and how your reputation and credibility can be affected if you don’t
					do
					extensive work to close the project completely.<br />[MUSIC PLAYING] I’ve talked to you about
					retrospectives quite a bit throughout this program.<br />And that’s because there really is no
					better
					tool for reflection and improvement.<br />Retrospectives are such an important aspect of the
					project,
					and it’s important to really emphasize that to you.<br />Throughout the course, I’m referring to the
					formal practice.<br />But a lot of us conduct informal retrospectives daily without even knowing
					it.<br />Whether we’re talking about our day with our friends or family, or thinking about how we
					can
					improve past interactions, we are constantly reflecting and working toward progress.<br />So let’s
					revisit formal retrospectives for a moment to explore how they tie into the formal project closing
					process.<br />You might remember that a retrospective is a meeting aimed to discuss successes,
					failures,
					and possible improvements on the project.<br />They can occur after a major milestone completion and
					at
					the end of a project.<br />In order to understand the importance of closing a project, let’s discuss
					the
					three main retrospective benefits for your team.<br />Retrospectives encourage team building because
					they allow team members to understand differing perspectives.<br />Retrospectives facilitate
					improved
					collaboration on future projects.<br />And they promote positive changes in future procedures and
					processes.<br />So it’s no surprise that a retrospective is a critical part of closing a
					project.<br />Whether your team has chosen to close the project after each phase or comprehensively
					at
					the end, you’ll conduct retrospectives as a part of that process.<br />There may be temptation
					within
					your project team to resist reflecting before forging ahead into the next phase.<br />But you can’t
					grow
					and improve if you don’t spend time reflecting.<br />Reflecting is a great way to learn which
					practices
					you should keep doing and which ones you can improve upon.<br />As a project manager, you want to
					build
					a culture within your team and company to aim for constant improvements.<br />This means that you’ll
					need to solicit feedback that will help you to do better in your next project.<br />This feedback
					might
					touch on any aspect of the project, from planning, scheduling, execution, communication, or team
					dynamics.<br />You might receive feedback about processes you led.<br />And that’s OK.<br />Working
					through feedback is crucial to your growth as a project manager.<br />It’s important to create a
					safe
					space for that feedback so that folks can really share what they’re thinking and the team can grow
					together.<br />This is a key piece to help improve collaborations on future projects.<br />Part of
					encouraging continuous growth is to recognize and celebrate a job well done.<br />The way you
					celebrate
					will change depending on where you’re at in the project and what feels most appropriate to your
					team.<br />Taking a moment to reward yourselves with a token of appreciation turns the celebration
					into
					a team-building exercise.<br />Being appreciative ensures that the work you’re doing feels uplifting
					and
					rewarding, rather than monotonous and tiring.<br />It also fuels positive change.<br />So when
					closing a
					project, don’t forget the fun elements.<br />Make sure to play a game, eat some cake, and celebrate
					some
					quality time together because you’ve earned it.<br />Let’s review.<br />Retrospectives encourage
					team
					building because they allow team members to understand differing perspectives.<br />They facilitate
					improved collaboration on future projects, and they promote positive changes in future procedures
					and
					processes.<br />[MUSIC PLAYING] Let’s discuss what the project closure process means for you, the
					project manager.<br />For a project manager, it’s important to close a project properly for a number
					of
					reasons.<br />Closing provides an opportunity to reflect on how you and your team performed, ensure
					every task is completed, and prevent confusion around the project in the future.<br />I’ll detail
					the
					importance of these closing practices as well as the necessary documentation to successfully close a
					project.<br />One of the most important aspects of thoroughly closing a project is the project
					closeout
					report.<br />A project closeout report is a document created by project managers for project
					managers.<br />A project closeout report serves three major purposes.<br />First, it’s a blueprint
					to
					document what the team did, how they did it, and what they delivered.<br />Second, it provides an
					evaluation of the quality of work.<br />And third, it evaluates the project’s performance with
					respect
					to budget and schedule.<br />Similar to the retrospective, the project closeout report can be used
					to
					determine best practices when it comes to future projects.<br />Think of it as a transfer of
					knowledge
					from you to future project managers.<br />For instance, once a project closes, there’s a chance a
					similar project or a continuation of that project will come up within the organization.<br />And
					maybe a
					different project manager is assigned to this new project while you go onto other things.<br />If
					you
					create an in-depth closeout report, it will help the newly assigned project manager immensely to
					know
					what happened previously on a similar project.<br />Your closeout report could include things that
					worked out well and things that didn’t work out so well.<br />Creating a closeout report will also
					reduce the time you spend answering questions as the new project manager gets up to speed.<br />It’s
					safe to assume that the people reading your report in the future will be unfamiliar with the
					project.<br />So be as detailed as possible.<br />That way, the new project team will be able to
					form an
					understanding of the purpose, execution, and outcome of the project based on your report
					alone.<br />In
					your project closeout report, you’ll want to include the following things.<br />An executive
					summary–
					this means a description of the process and what the purpose of the project was.<br />This should be
					short and concise, a few sentences to a paragraph maximum.<br />If an executive didn’t have time to
					read
					the entire document and only had time to read this executive summary, would they be able to
					understand
					the project highlights?<br />A list of key accomplishments– think of this as a way to highlight the
					team’s accomplishments as well as the overall impact of the project.<br />Include any lessons
					learned,
					like what went well and why, what went wrong and why.<br />What were the major effects of key
					problem
					areas, such as scope creep and schedule slip?<br />Any open items– this could be things you didn’t
					quite
					get to or ideas for changes you’d make if you had had the time.<br />Your next step– things like are
					there expected followup projects and is there any ongoing maintenance required?<br />You also want
					to
					include important information about the schedule and important deadlines, like what were your
					milestones
					and how did you choose them, how long did the project take, did the project stay on track, and any
					information about major setbacks.<br />Be sure to list resources and team members.<br />Explain who
					was
					involved and what their roles were.<br />This is also a key way to acknowledge people who
					contributed to
					the project’s completion.<br />And finally, include a resources and project archive
					section.<br />This
					will include links to things like your original project plan; any documented stakeholder
					communication
					and feedback, like meeting notes; any documentation used to track, monitor, and report; and any
					technical information related to the project deliverables, like user guides and
					manuals.<br />Hopefully
					by now you understand how project closeout reports are beneficial to not only the organization but
					the
					project manager as well.<br />Project closeout reports promote visibility among team members and
					create
					more efficient future projects.<br />ROWENA: Congratulations on finishing this video in a Google
