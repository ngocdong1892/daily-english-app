					Are you ready to learn some real life English with comprehensible input? Well, good, because today
					I've got a fun video full of useful vocabulary and I'm going to share a very native expression with
					you today while I tell you guys about my bucket list. Let's go. Hey guys, it is your English
					speakaking friend Kyle and today we are going to improve our English with comprehensible input. What
					is comprehensible input? Comprehensible input is when a native speaker like me speaks slowly and
					clearly so that you can understand. And today guys, we've got a fun video. We're going to think and
					imagine and learn. So guys, today I'm going to tell you about my bucket list. Camera wife, what's a
					bucket list?<br>
					Things that you want to do before you die. A bucket list is things that you want to do, experiences
					that you want to have before you die. Camera wife, why is it called a bucket list?
					Because it's in a bucket.<br>
					She says because it's a list that's in a bucket. No, I'm joking.
					Well, why then? Maybe.
					Um, I don't know.<br>
					Because, guys, there's a phrase to kick to kick the bucket. And to kick the bucket means to die. So,
					your bucket list is a list of experiences that you want to have before you do what, wife?
					Die.<br>
					Kick the bucket. Before you kick the bucket.
					Yeah.
					So, guys, today I'm going to share with you five things that are on my bucket list. Five awesome
					experiences that I want to have before I kick the bucket.<br>
					First thing on my bucket list, the first experience that I want to have before I die is to live in
					another country. I've traveled to other countries. I'm sure I will travel to many more other
					countries, but I have only lived in the United States. And I really want to live in another country
					before I kick the bucket. I think that living in a place you get a whole different experience than
					just visiting. My camera wife is shaking her head because she's had that experience and I want that
					experience.<br>
					So, where would I want to live? Take a guess. Camera wife.
					Colia.
					Colia. I would love to live in Colombia.
					We love Colombians here on the channel.<br>
					We love Colombia. There's another place that I think would be interesting.
					Montreal. When we visited Montreal, I absolutely love that city. Friendly people, they speak French,
					good food, clean. I would really love to have a place in Montreal. So, the first thing on my bucket
					list is to live for at least some amount of time in another country. The second item on my bucket
					list, guys, when I was younger, there was a movie called Indiana Jones. And Indiana Jones is a man
					in the movie who explores. He goes on adventures. Indiana Jones. Indiana Jones was awesome. He was
					my hero. I wanted an awesome Indiana Jones hat. And the second item on my bucket list is to have an
					Indiana Jones type adventure. What does that mean?<br>
					Indiana Jones would do things like explore tombs and pyramids in Egypt or he would be in the
					jungles. That's the kind of thing I want to do. One thing I always wanted to do is go to the Amazon
					rainforest. That sounds like such a cool adventure for me. There's so many scary animals out there
					and rivers and so many awesome things that can hurt you, but also beautiful, incredible things to
					see and experiences to have. So, the second item on my list is to one day have an Indiana Jones
					adventure in the Amazon rainforest. Number three, the third item on my bucket list. The third thing
					I want to do before I do what, wife?<br>
					Kick the bucket. kick the bucket. I want to have conversations. I want to speak with my language
					learning heroes. There are two there are two that I really want to speak with. And now that the
					channel's growing, hey, it's a possibility. My language learning heroes that I want to speak with
					are Pablo Roman from Dreaming Spanish, who helped me so much learning my Spanish and really inspired
					this channel in a huge way. Because of Pablo's work on dreaming Spanish, I was so inspired. I found
					out that comprehensible input is a beautiful uh useful, fun, and effective way to learn languages.
					For that reason, I would love to speak with Pablo one day and tell him how much I appreciate his
					work and I would like to have that conversation in Spanish. Second language learning hero, wife, you
					know who it is?<br>
					No.
					Steve Kaufman.
					Steve Kaufman. This guy, this guy is awesome. He speaks like 20 languages and he created the
					language learning application Link, which is one of my favorite apps. So, Steve, if you need
					somebody to help you promote Link, I'm the guy. Steve is a very cool guy. I've watched so many of
					his videos. His app has helped me a lot with my Spanish and my French. And just watching his content
					has kept me motivated and I really find him inspiring because he's like 75 or something. He's he's
					an older man and he still is learning every day. So when I get to that age, I want to be like Steve
					and I would love to tell him that.<br>
					Number four, the fourth thing that I want to do before I kick the bucket.
					Before I kick the bucket. All right, guys. I have a son. Love my son. He's incredible. Wonderful
					boy. An experience that I want to have before I kick the bucket. I want to have a daughter. I want
					to have the experience of being a father to a little girl because I've already had the experience of
					being a father to a boy. So now I want to have a daughter and I want to have a child with my
					beautiful camera wife, somebody who I love so much. So guys, that's one thing I want to do. That's
					one thing I'm sure will happen, but it's just something that is very special to me and something
					that I hope happens sometime soon. All right, guys. Number five, the last thing on my bucket list,
					last thing I want to do before I kick the bucket. I want to go to a lot of different countries and
					try the food that they are known for.<br>
					Okay, an example, I want to go to Italy and have a wonderful plate of pasta. I want to go to Spain
					and eat paella. I want to go to Argentina and eat a sushi in Japan. And I would absolutely love to
					go eat some authentic plav in Usbekiststan. All right, guys. Those were the items on my bucket list,
					the things that I want to do before I kick the bucket. Guys, I'd really like to do a video soon, and
					I need your help with it. Okay? I want to do a questions and answers video with questions from my
					subscribers. So guys, please, if you have any questions that you would like to hear me answer in a
					video, tell me down in the comments, okay? I want to make a video where I respond to all of your
					guys's questions. You could get to know me better. I could get to know you better. Also, you know
					what, guys? Tell me something from your bucket list, an experience that you want to have before you
					kick the bucket.<br>
					Before you kick the bucket. All right, guys. This was just a short video. I had to work today. So,
					I'm a little bit tired, but I wanted to bring you guys some more content so we can keep on going
					with the English learning. Thank you all for spending your time with me.
					Thank you, camera wife, for recording me. I'll see you guys in the next video.
