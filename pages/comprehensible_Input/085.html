					want to do this I want to learn this I want to go there now here we do it we do it okay we're doers
					we're not talkers so I was reading I was reading an article okay on articulo I was reading an
					article and the article said that only three percent three percent of people have goals okay they
					have goals that they're thinking about and trying to achieve okay and only one percent one percent
					of people have their goals written down okay so today today what we are going to do is become part
					of the one percent so first I want to talk about why a lot of people do not achieve their goals
					porque the first reason they don't have goals they don't have goals okay they don't sit down and
					think oh I I want to do this I want to achieve this I want to learn this okay how are you ever going
					to achieve anything that's why so many people they don't change they do the same thing every day
					they never learn anything new they never experience anything new they never achieve goals and I do
					not know about you but for me that's not a life that I want to live the second reason that most
					people do not achieve their goals is because they do not they do not have it written down when you
					write down your goals and you look at them and you focus on them and you start to plan and you start
					to plan and think how can I achieve this what is my next step I mean proximo Paso okay what can I do
					next that is when you start to achieve goals okay now this is something that I've been doing for a
					long time I've been writing my goals down for a long time because I'm a dreamer okay I'm a dreamer I
					dream Sonia door okay I I always dream about better things so I write down my goals and I visualize
					them okay visualize so if you are somebody who has your goals written down very good very good okay
					that means that you are in the one percent awesome awesome but if you do not have your goals written
					down I want you to go and grab go and grab some paper and a pen or a pencil okay we're gonna do it
					together because here in this channel we work together to achieve our goals okay so what are we
					going to do we're going to take our pen and our paper and we're going to write goals okay now if you
					want to write methus you want to write your list in Spanish do it okay this is not about English
					okay you're listening to English right now and that's good but this you need to understand it well
					okay because this is your plans for the future this is how you're going to grow as a person and how
					you're going to become more successful in your life okay and I'm doing the same thing I'm with you
					we're doing it together okay because here we all want to achieve our goals so what we're going to do
					today we're going to focus so Focus Simple Car focus on three goals okay so we're gonna write on the
					paper one two three uno dos tres okay with space in between it's last year okay so now I want you to
					think I want you to think what is the most important goal that you want to achieve in your life
					right now okay what is the goal that you want to focus on the most is it to make more money at your
					job are you really really really trying to learn your English right now okay do you want to go to
					the gym and get fit okay what's your number one goal because we're going to start with the most
					important okay so for me my first goal is to grow the YouTube channel okay grow the YouTube channel
					I've been working on pensando English I've been working on it working on it working on it okay
					that's my number one goal right now okay let's think let's think of a second goal okay so my second
					goal right now that I really want to work on is to improve my French okay so my second goal is to
					improve my French I want to work on my French to where my French is as good as my Spanish okay I
					want to speak Spanish and French both very well okay I want my French to be so good that if somebody
					from France speaks to me and I'm speaking French they say wow you speak very good french okay my
					Spanish is isn't perfect but I'm very happy with it okay because if I meet you we could speak in
					Spanish we could speak in English no problems okay but my French there's a lot of times where it's
					hard to say what I want to say so I want to work on my French to where I'm comfortable speaking in
					French now my third goal my third goal is I want to save some money okay I want to save some money
					okay so now we have our three goals written down now what's the next step we're going to think we're
					going to think of what we can do to start working on these goals okay what are some steps that we
					can take steps puzzles that we can take to start putting these plans into action now action action
					action is very important okay the best plan in the world del Mundo is no good it means nothing means
					nothing if you don't put it into action okay you can think all day long but if you're not doing if
					you're not trying to improve and work nothing's gonna happen okay and I learned this in the past
					okay I dreamed and I dreamed and I dreamed but I didn't do enough work on those goals okay so I
					didn't achieve them but now it's different it's different because I think and I do right now it's
					six o'clock in the morning in Indiana six o'clock in the morning the sun the sun is not even up yet
					okay the sun's not up but I'm up I'm up and I'm working on my goals so my first goal is to grow my
					YouTube channel okay so now I have to think Hmm have to think what can I do to grow my YouTube
					channel okay so this is a step that I already started taking a couple weeks ago I decided I'm going
					to make three videos each week okay sometimes in the past I made one video every 10 days or
					something but now I have it structured okay I have it scheduled I'm making three videos each week so
					I'm gonna write down my first step three videos each week I put out a video on Monday on Wednesday
					and on Friday okay three videos each week Monday Wednesday Friday and uh that has been a very good
					and successful step for me that's helped me to start growing and it's funny because when you start
					to work on your goals and focus on them good things start happening to you now this is a little bit
					crazy okay it's Loco pero es la verdad two days two days after I started after I decided that I was
					going to start working really hard on my channel two days Mr Salas posted a video about YouTubers
					that deserve more subscribers and he posted my channel and said that my channel Valero okay two days
					two days after I decided I was going to do this when you start working on your goals good things
					start to happen for you okay so I'm gonna keep on going with this so my first goal grow my YouTube
					channel and the first step is to make three videos each week okay every week no matter what no
					matter what you can count on it there will be a new video Monday Wednesday Friday okay okay so think
					what was your first goal okay think about what your first goal was now think what can you do to
					start right now right now to start to achieve it okay so for example say your goal is to learn
					English okay you write down I am going to spend one hour at least no matter what one hour every day
					with English okay maybe you watch one of my videos 10 15 minutes maybe you'll read 20 minutes and
					then maybe you'll watch a show on Netflix okay A little show for 30 minutes that's an hour okay but
					you have to do it every day c-o-c second goal improve my French so how can I improve my French well
					like I just said about your English I have to pass the time in the language [Music] so what am I
					going to do I'm going to commit to taking at least one class a week one class a week on italki with
					a French speaker and every day I will read I will read in French and I will watch or listen to at
					least one thing in French okay my third goal my third goal is to save money okay is to save money
					how how can I save money okay so I'm going to start to save 10 okay every time that I get paid every
					time I get my paycheck I'm going to take 10 of that and put it away so my friends if you wrote down
					your goals and the next steps to work on them you are part of the one percent of people the one
					percent of people who achieve their goals I hope that this video was useful for you guys you got to
					listen listen to some English okay and I hope that you started to think you started thinking about
					how you're going to work on your goals okay because a plan without action means nothing my friends
