				<p id="1cf468a0-53d4-816d-a6fd-d800b1e30a40" class="">SPEAKER: So during the initiation phase, it’s
					important to ask yourself, what are the things we still need to acquire in order to complete our
					project?<br />Project resources usually include budget, people, and materials.<br />You’ll use tools
					to
					manage all those resources.<br />As you think about the goals and the scope of the project, you
					figure
					out the different resources you’ll need to meet those goals.<br />It’s important to figure out your
					resources before the project gets rolling.<br />This makes it easy for everyone on your team to get
					their work done.<br />And that’s your job as a project manager.<br />You won’t be doing the work
					directly, but you’ll support the people who do.<br />Figuring out resources early on also helps you
					avoid accidentally understaffing your project, which can seriously slow down team progress and eat
					away
					at the overall timeline.<br />Even worse, if you’re not careful with your resource planning, you
					could
					wind up underestimating the budget– meaning you might not have enough money to purchase necessary
					materials, higher vendors, or support overtime requests.<br />Planning your resources early is a
					great
					way to set your team up for success.<br />Because when your teammates have what they need to do
					their
					work on time and on budget, they’re better set up to meet the project’s goals.<br />Now let’s break
					down
					some of the resources that project managers typically work with.<br />First, let’s talk about
					budgets.<br />A budget is an estimate of the amount of money a project will cost to
					complete.<br />Almost all projects have budgets, because they need funding for expenses– like buying
					the
					right materials or software, hiring vendors to complete jobs, or doing marketing once the project is
					done.<br />During the initiation phase, you’ll talk to the stakeholders and the people working on
					the
					project to figure out the tasks needed to get the project done.<br />Here, you might ask questions
					to
					help uncover hidden costs.<br />For example, are there any taxes on products that you need to
					account
					for?<br />What about extra fees?<br />All this information will help you create a budget, which you
					can
					use to source and compare proposals from vendors, figure out upcoming costs, and track all the money
					moving in and out of your project.<br />You often include the budget and the project charter, and
					the
					stakeholders review it for approval.<br />We’ll talk more about what goes into creating a project
					budget
					and creating a project charter later on.<br />When we talk about resources, we’re also talking about
					the
					team of people who help execute the tasks of a project.<br />For example, you as the project manager
					are
					a resource.<br />So is the marketing manager, who might create advertisements for this new
					product.<br />Other resources can include people outside of your company, who have unique skills and
					can
					do certain tasks that people in your organization can’t do personally.<br />Then, you have
					materials.<br />These are items you need to help get the project done.<br />For example, project
					materials might include the lumber needed to complete a construction project.<br />So you know that
					project resources include budget, people, and materials.<br />How do you organize these
					resources?<br />That’s actually a nice transition into our next topic, which is tools.<br />Tools
					are
					aids that make it easier for a project manager or team to manage resources and organize
					work.<br />They
					help you do things like track tasks, manage budgets, and collaborate with teammates.<br />There are
					all
					kinds of tools out there, including productivity tools like Google Docs and work management software
					like Asana.<br />We’ll talk more about these tools later in this program.<br />Tools are essential
					for
					tracking progress, so you want to keep them top of mind at all phases of your project.<br />Let’s
					talk
					about how you might determine your resources during the initiation phase of your project at Office
					Green.<br />As a reminder, the Plant Pal service offers customers small, low-maintenance plants,
					like
					cacti and leafy ferns, that they can place on their desks.<br />Customers can order them online or
					from
					a print catalog, and Office Green will ship the plant straight to the customer’s work
					address.<br />The
					project goal is to increase revenue by 5%.<br />So how do you get started?<br />Well, you might do
					some
					research, to figure out the costs of launching the new plant service.<br />That might include the
					estimated prices of developing a new website and new promotional materials, as well as shipping and
					delivery costs.<br />You also might want to budget for specific tools, like a project management
					software that will help you track progress on this complex project.<br />With that information, you
					can
					start to build a realistic budget.<br />And you’ll also need to figure out who’s working on this
					project
					with you.<br />To do this, you might make a list of people and external vendors who will help
					complete
					all the project’s tasks.<br />For example, the person who manages client communications with
					customers,
					or a new plant supplier that can provide you with your product.<br />[MUSIC PLAYING] By now, you’ve
					probably noticed that a big part of project management is guiding decision making.<br />Even if
					you’re
					not the one making final decisions on major aspects of the project, it’s still your job to keep
					track of
					every new decision and use those decisions to create a plan.<br />And as you’ve learned, there are a
					lot
					of important decisions to keep track of.<br />That includes everything from identifying project
					goals
					and deliverables to choosing the right people to add to a team.<br />It’s way too much for any one
					person to mentally keep track of.<br />It’s also important information for everyone on the team to
					be
					aware of, not just a project manager.<br />If a decision affects a member of the team’s tasks,
					they’ll
					need to know about it, right?<br />That’s why documentation is such an important part of a project
					manager’s role.<br />While your team may work deeply on specific areas of the project, you might be
					the
					only person on the team who is aware of and communicating across all the different areas of the
					project.<br />Clear and consistent documentation can ensure transparency and clear
					communication.<br />Documentation helps set the stage for the project.<br />It communicates the
					answers
					to key questions.<br />For example, what problem are you trying to solve?<br />What are the project
					goals?<br />What are the scope and deliverables, and who are the project stakeholders?<br />And
					lastly,
					what resources does a team need to complete their work?<br />This is all crucial information for
					anyone
					who’s working on a project, regardless of their role.<br />Documentation also helps preserve
					decisions
					made early on in the project and can serve as a reference point for team members who might join
					later in
					the project lifecycle.<br />It’s your job to ensure that this information is easily accessible,
					through
					some kind of formal documentation, like an email, a presentation, or a digital document.<br />Also,
					documenting decisions can help you uncover tasks– timelines or costs you hadn’t previously
					considered.<br />And lastly, this process provides a historical record that can be reviewed at the
					end
					of your project.<br />You can apply the lessons you’ve learned in the future.<br />OK, let’s get
					into
					different types of documentation.<br />Up next, we’ll look at project proposals and project
					charters–
					two types of documents that can set you up for success early on.<br />[MUSIC PLAYING] Now let’s talk
					about two common types of documentation you could use to keep track of details and keep your
					stakeholders informed.<br />These are the project proposal, and the project charter.<br />A project
					proposal is a form of documentation that comes at the very beginning of the project.<br />This
					document’s purpose is to persuade stakeholders that a project should begin.<br />And typically, a
					senior
					organizational leader creates the proposal.<br />So you might not need to worry about creating the
					proposal, but you will have to keep track of the proposal’s progress.<br />The project proposal is a
					great starting point to help you understand the desired goals and impact.<br />A proposal may be a
					formal document, a presentation, or even a simple email to get others on board with the
					idea.<br />Then,
					we have the project charter– a formal document that clearly defines the project and outlines the
					necessary details to reach its goals.<br />A project charter helps you get organized, set up a
					framework
					for what needs to be done, and communicate those details to others.<br />So how do these documents
					differ?<br />A project proposal is created earlier in the project lifecycle than the project
					charter.<br />The proposal kicks off the initiation phase by influencing and persuading the company
					to
					move forward with the project.<br />The project charter serves a similar purpose, and often comes at
					the
					end of the initiation phase.<br />However, its goal is to more clearly define the key details of the
					project.<br />Another difference between these two documents is that a charter will often serve as a
					point of reference throughout the life of a project.<br />The proposal is only used at the earliest
					stages.<br />Now that the difference between these two documents, let’s take a closer look at the
					project charter, which you’ll learn more about in this module.<br />The project charter makes clear
					that
					the benefits of a project outweigh the costs.<br />As you learned earlier in this course, there are
					a
					few questions you might ask yourself when performing a cost-benefit analysis.<br />That includes
					questions like, what value will this project create?<br />How much money could this project save my
					organization?<br />And how much time will people have to spend on this project?<br />You include the
					answers to these questions in your charter.<br />Including this type of information ensures that you
					and
					your stakeholders agree on the project value.<br />The charter also helps ensure that you and your
					stakeholders agree on the details of the project.<br />Project charter approval means that
					management is
					supportive, and is also a key step to ensure that the project matches the needs of the
					organization.<br />After the stakeholders and project sponsor has reviewed and approved the project
					charter, you now have the authority to move forward with the project.<br />Project charters can be
					formatted in a few ways and can contain different information, depending on the project and the
					organization.<br />The information in a charter might also be tailored to this audience, or the
					needs of
					specific stakeholders.<br />For example, if you’re writing a project charter for a stakeholder who
					is a
					marketing executive, the charter might include information about how the project will impact the
					organization’s brand.<br />Or if the stakeholder’s a chief technology officer, the charter might
					include
					information on the costs of engineering resources needed to maintain the project.<br />Regardless of
					the
					format or the audience, creating a project charter is a best practice for ensuring that everyone
					agrees
					on how to move forward before entering the planning phase.<br />The project charter is a living
					document.<br />This means that it can evolve as the project progresses.<br />As the project manager,
					you’ll review and refine the charter throughout the process.<br />Now that more about the value of a
					project charter, it’s time to learn how to create one.<br />[MUSIC PLAYING] Project charters are key
					for
					securing approval from stakeholders and moving forward.<br />Project charters can also be formatted
					in
					many different ways, and there are many different templates available online for you to choose
					from.<br />Here, we’ll use a template that’s similar to one that program managers often use at
					Google.<br />And to fill in each section, we’ll use details from your project at Office
					Green.<br />Ready?<br />Let’s take a look.<br />At the top of your charter, you want to add in the
					name
					of your project.<br />Let’s add in the name of your project at Office Green.<br />It’s called,
					Project
					Plant Pals.<br />You’ll also want to add in a brief summary.<br />Let’s type that in.<br />Our plan
					is
					to offer high-volume customers small, low-maintenance plants that can thrive in an office
					environment.<br />Next up, let’s fill in the section labeled project goals.<br />Remember that goals
					should be smart, which means that they are specific, measurable, actionable, relevant, and time
					bound.<br />Let’s add in the goal for Project Plant Pals, which is to increase revenue by 5%, by
					rolling
					out a new service that provides office plants to top clients by the end of the
					year.<br />Great.<br />Now let’s add in the project deliverable.<br />Remember that a deliverable is
					a
					tangible outcome from a project.<br />As you learned earlier, our deliverables for this project are
					to
					send 1,000 plants to 100 customers and to launch a new website for orders and customer
					support.<br />Now
					let’s add in the business case, which captures the reasoning for initiating this project.<br />Let’s
					type in, this is a top-requested service from our customers, and it will also improve customer
					satisfaction and retention.<br />The business case is supported by the cost-benefit analysis, and
					we’ll
					add that in now.<br />Let’s start with the benefits.<br />The benefits, or expected gains of the
					project, include improving customer satisfaction and an increase in revenue.<br />Now, we’ll move on
					to
					the costs.<br />The costs include the price of the sourcing products, developing a website, and
					marketing materials.<br />Let’s type in $250,000, for the estimated budget.<br />Nice.<br />We’ve
					now
					outlined some of the benefits and costs of this project.<br />Keep in mind that these are simple
					examples, to teach you the basics of filling out a charter.<br />When running a real project, you
					perform a more-detailed analysis to determine the benefits and costs.<br />The key takeaway here is
					that
					benefits should always outweigh the costs.<br />Fantastic.<br />Let’s keep going.<br />Next, we’re
					going
					to add in the project scope, as well as what’s considered out of scope for this
					project.<br />Remember,
					scope is an agreed-upon understanding of what is included or excluded from a project.<br />An item
					that
					is in scope includes creating a service to deliver small plants to last year’s top clients.<br />An
					item
					that is out of scope, and therefore not available to customers, includes plant care after they’re
					delivered.<br />Amazing.<br />Hopefully, you can see how stating what’s in scope and what’s out of
					scope
					helps everyone working on the project understand where they should focus their
					efforts.<br />Great.<br />Now let’s add in your project team.<br />Let’s see here.<br />The project
					sponsor is Office Green’s director of product.<br />So let’s add that in.<br />Who is the project
					lead?<br />Well, that’s the you.<br />The project team may include marketing associates, website
					developers, and external plant vendors, and more.<br />So we can add in a few important project team
					members here.<br />Awesome.<br />Let’s move on to additional stakeholders.<br />Additional
					stakeholders
					may include the vice president of customer success, who is accountable for customer feedback and
					corresponding product requests.<br />We can also add in the account manager, who will leverage their
					existing relationships with top clients.<br />And let’s also add in the fulfillment manager, who
					will
					help acquire the plants needed to launch the service.<br />We’re almost done.<br />Let’s add in how
					we’ll measure success.<br />Here, we’ll type in that we want to see a 5% increase in revenue by the
					end
					of the year.<br />Let’s also type in that we want to hit a customer satisfaction rate of 95% three
					months after launch.<br />That’s it, the project charter is filled in, and now it’s ready to be
					reviewed
					by your stakeholders.<br />Now you’re done.<br />You’ve seen how documentation helps form the roots
					of a
					project and how it contributes to the project’s ultimate success.<br />Like nurturing a plan, you’re
					learning to nurture a project, to ensure it’s the best it can be.<br />[MUSIC PLAYING] As a project
					manager, tools are some of the most helpful resources you have at your disposal.<br />They’re
					essential
					for tracking progress, so it’s important to keep them top of mind throughout the entire
					project.<br />Let’s talk more about why tools are so useful and why it’s important to choose the
					right
					ones for your needs.<br />There are lots of different tools out there, and you’ll learn more about
					them
					later.<br />As a reminder, tools are aids that make it easier for a project manager or team to
					manage
					resources and organize work.<br />They are useful because they can help you track detailed
					information
					about all kinds of tasks, and they make it easy to communicate with lots of different
					people.<br />And
					remember, effective communication and tracking are huge parts of a project manager’s day-to-day
					responsibilities.<br />Just think about how much tougher your job would be without help from
					collaboration tools like email, or digital documents created in Google Docs or Microsoft
					Word.<br />Let’s imagine this in the context of our project at Office Green.<br />As lead project
					manager, you have tons of information about the company’s plan to provide office-friendly plants to
					top
					clients.<br />But what would happen if you wrote every project detail on a whiteboard instead of
					shared
					online document?<br />Well, every member of your team will have to stop by your desk to get the
					latest
					information.<br />And that’s definitely not the most efficient use of anyone’s time.<br />But if you
					store this information in easily accessible online documents, you save everyone on the team time,
					energy, and a major headache.<br />Today’s tools have made us so much easier to share information
					with
					teammates.<br />Even better, with project management tools, information sharing goes both
					ways.<br />That means team members can also easily update you on their progress, without the need
					for
					extra meetings or phone calls.<br />How great is that?<br />When you choose the right tool for a
					project, you make it easy for teammates to let if a task is on schedule, or if it’s delayed, which
					lets
					you quickly see how any changes might affect the rest of the project.<br />Management tools
					increases
					visibility and transparency for everyone, including stakeholders.<br />You can use a variety of
					tools to
					accomplish many different things, like tracking progress on tasks, deliverables, and
					milestones.<br />Tools can also help you manage a budget, build helpful charts and diagrams, manage
					contracts and licenses, and keep stakeholders informed.<br />Tools can be straightforward, like
					digital
					spreadsheets or documents, or they can be more sophisticated, like scheduling and work-management
					software.<br />It’s important to think about the needs of the project when choosing which to
					use.<br />One thing to keep in mind is that if you choose a more sophisticated tool, your teammates
					and
					stakeholders will need some time to get familiar with it.<br />For small projects, that might be
					more
					trouble than it’s worth.<br />So for small projects, a straightforward tool might be more
					effective.<br />But if a project has a big scope, then it might be worth the team’s time to learn
					and
					ultimately work with a more sophisticated project management tool.<br />You should also keep in mind
					that sometimes you won’t have a choice about the types of tools you use.<br />If an organization has
					already decided to use a specific tool, then you’ll need to work with what they give you.<br />It’s
					all
					about remaining flexible.<br />Are you starting to see how you can use tools to keep projects on
					track?<br />Whether they’re straightforward or sophisticated, tools have the power to help you
					communicate and manage more effectively.<br />[MUSIC PLAYING] One common tool type is scheduling and
					work-management software.<br />There are lots of different types of work-management software on the
					market, including popular tools like these.<br />Certain tools may work better for your project,
					depending on a bunch of things– for example, the project methodology you’re running, or the number
					of
					tasks and people involved.<br />So why would you choose to use scheduling and work-management
					software?<br />Well, it can be really useful for assigning tasks to multiple teammates and for
					tracking
					progress on that work.<br />It can also help you visualize your team’s progress.<br />For example,
					if
					you’re using work-management software to assign and track tasks, you’re more likely to notice if
					your
					team completes 50 tasks one week and just three tasks the following week.<br />That’s a clear sign
					that
					you need to check in to see if there’s a problem that’s blocking progress.<br />If you hadn’t been
					tracking their tasks, you might not have noticed the issue.<br />That’s part of the reason why
					work-management software is so useful.<br />It provides an overview of how the project is going, so
					you
					know when you need to check in with your teams to get tasks back on track.<br />Another type of
					project
					management tool we’ll discuss is tools for productivity.<br />Productivity tools can be very helpful
					for
					you and your team.<br />This includes word-processing tools like Microsoft Word or Google
					Docs.<br />You
					can use these to create shared documents with the team, like the project charter, we taught you how
					to
					fill out earlier.<br />You can also use these tools to build documents, like meeting agendas and
					status
					updates.<br />And we’ll talk more about these in a later course.<br />Spreadsheets are another
					useful
					productivity tool.<br />They’re versatile, and you can use them to make documents like RACI charts
					and
					project plans, as well as other helpful charts, you’ll learn more about in the later
					course.<br />And
					presentations created in tools like Microsoft PowerPoint, Keynote, or Google Slides can be a great
					way
					to package your project in a visual, easily digestible way.<br />Now let’s discuss collaboration
					tools,
					which you probably rely on to work closely with your teammates.<br />These include tools you’re
					probably
					familiar with, like email and chat.<br />Tools like this can help you quickly and efficiently check
					in
					with each other on questions, comments, and other topics related to the project.<br />Productivity
					tools
					like documents and spreadsheets, and collaboration tools like email and chat are all pretty simple,
					which means they’re great for smaller projects with fewer tasks and teammates to keep track
					of.<br />Scheduling and work-management software is better for bigger projects with a larger number
					of
					tasks and a bigger team of people to manage.<br />Cool.<br />You’ve learned more about the types of
					tools available to you, including scheduling and work-management software, productivity tools, and
					collaboration tools.<br />We’ll spend the next video diving a bit deeper on some of the most popular
					project management tools out there.<br />[MUSIC PLAYING] Earlier, you learned about different types
					of
					project management tools, from scheduling and work-management software to tools for productivity and
					collaboration.<br />Now let’s discuss a few popular tools, you might be expected to use, or at least
					be
					familiar with.<br />There are many different types of work-management software, that automatically
					make
					project planning and tracking a lot easier and that are much more efficient than manual project
					tracking.<br />One tool that will focus on in this program is Asana.<br />Asana is a work-management
					platform, that helps teams plan and coordinate their work, from daily tasks to strategic
					initiatives.<br />Asana provides a living system and a source of truth where everyone’s work
					lives.<br />With Asana, everyone can see, discuss, and manage team priorities, giving teams clarity
					on
					who is doing what by when.<br />It’s great for building project plans, assigning tasks, automating
					workflows, tracking progress, and communicating with stakeholders.<br />As a project manager, you
					can
					use Asana to create a log of tasks, like gathering cost estimates from external vendors, and assign
					a
					task to people on the team.<br />All tasks are visible and organized in the format of the project
					manager’s choice, like in a list or on a calendar, and designed to drive transparency and connection
					with all the tasks related to the overall goal.<br />It’s easy to use with external stakeholders, as
					well, because within Asana, you can share status updates and other communications with people
					outside
					your company.<br />Another great tool we’ll focus on throughout this program is the
					spreadsheet.<br />Spreadsheets are extremely versatile, and you can use them for a wide range of
					tasks,
					from creating timelines and building charts to managing budgets and tracking tasks.<br />You can add
					and
					view project information in a variety of formats depending on what you need in the moment.<br />For
					example, let’s say you enter a list of tasks, due dates, completion statuses, and task owners into a
					spreadsheet.<br />From there it’s very simple to sort the list by due date, to see what’s due
					next.<br />You can then filter the list of tasks by task owner, so that you’ll only see the things
					you’re responsible for.<br />You can also highlight the rows of the sheet in different colors, to
					visually illustrate the tasks with the least progress.<br />With spreadsheets, you can easily
					transform,
					visualize, and manipulate information.<br />Spreadsheets and more comprehensive tools like Asana are
					just two options for effective project management, and it’s a good idea to get a basic understanding
					of
					a variety of software options out there.<br />Then, if your company doesn’t have a standard software
					tool, you can choose the right one for the project needs.<br />Being able to recommend the right
					tool
					for the job can be a great way to add value to your team at the beginning of a project.<br />Keep in
					mind, however, that software options are constantly changing.<br />From the addition of new features
					to
					the launch of new tools, there’s no way for you to know every software available– and no company
					would
					expect that of you.<br />Many of these tools have similar functionality, like task tracking and task
					assignment.<br />So if you understand one tool deeply, you should be able to easily adapt to a new
					tool
					on the job.<br />ROWENA: Congratulations on finishing this video in the Google Project Management
