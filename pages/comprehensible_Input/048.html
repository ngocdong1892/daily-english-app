					Italian okay okay Miguel can you can you tell me a little bit about yourself well my name is Miguel
					I am 24. I'm from regime Colombia in this moment I am a student in English in an academy  um
					okay and how long have you been learning English Well India in this Academy I started in in February
					but that is stored in English um from  two three years ago okay okay and why do you want to
					learn English basically because I like it and like a story in English I feel that I that I'm good in
					that and you said you live in Medellin right yeah okay what tell me a little bit about your city do
					you do you like to live there what do you think about your city this city have a lot of things what
					I like to to went out with fans I like the the night the night City the one thing that I don't like
					it about this city is the the weather is very hot here sometimes so it's very hot there it could be
					very hot yeah okay so what do you like to do for fun you said you like to stay at home what do you
					like to do to entertain yourself at home when watch videos watch series movies  read
					sometimes I like to play video games okay okay and do you usually watch shows in English or in
					Spanish I usually seen this in in English with subtitles very good well I I think you you understand
					pretty well English I think you're you're doing very well okay um Miguel is there is there anybody
					else in your family who speaks English or just you and I my sister uh nakos nobody else in my family
					speaks Spanish at all so it can be difficult when you don't have anybody to practice with right um
					well I don't practice with them because I feel this is strange but I feel very ashamed with them but
					we're not with strangers mm-hmm okay I understand yeah I understand sometimes it's it's harder with
					people that we know very well right yeah all right so you you watch the the video I made with the
					girl from Mexico America right yeah so you saw that I asked her some some questions that were a
					little bit deeper practical swing lessons yeah okay so I I have some questions uh what are some
					things that you are very grateful for in your life I think that I'm grateful with grateful right
					family because they support me foreign mm-hmm  something like that I'm very grateful with my
					grandma my sister my father I think it's great that you you could be grateful for your family and
					that they help you and not everybody has that so you I think you could definitely be grateful for
					that all right here here's a good question what is what is your biggest fear definitely loneliness
					loneliness yeah in my biggest in my big fear well I'm usually stay along with me come on like an
					introvert person but sometimes I need to to run out and see and hear what other people say is when a
					person says of people's anyway the human being is a very sociable animal definitely so is this this
					is my biggest fear okay to be completely alone loneliness yeah okay that that's a that's a deep one
					and that's uh I think a lot of people feel that way sometimes um sometimes it's hard to connect with
					people but English can help if you speak English that's a whole lot of other people who you could
					talk to so so in Medellin if you leave your house and you're walking to a store or wherever to go
					see a friend do you feel safe walking around um no maybe yeah um but actually I work in the night
					alone to meet with my friends so came back to my home I usually Walk Alone in the night but I
					usually went out in the night so maybe in that moment I don't feel very secure boom Boom the rest of
					the day I feel secure maybe because I I usually when I don't usually went to to complicated songs
					right right okay so you know where the the safe places are and where the dangerous places are no I'm
					just over there what is something that you would like to do in your future that you have never done
					before some try something new my new experience um I would like and to try to develop my own video
					game oh okay I like it um Maybe I would like to write a book a novel if you were going to make your
					your own video game well with this video game be about um basically is about action you have to to
					kill monster to drive up to to level up okay that's cool so how about a book what would you like to
					write a book about um maybe about science fiction you said you might write a science fiction book
					what do you think about aliens do you think there are other creatures on different planets is there
					other life in the universe I want to believe in in that possibility right um because they feel their
					loneliness right so it's complicated because see what is the the alien really exists uh what kind of
					technologists are right so maybe they are they have a advanced technology or maybe they in the
					foreign with a possibility the the sister other societies right it's complicated but I want to do
					they were they they will be real right so you hope that they are real and you would want to know
					about them if they are yeah I want to know then maybe no hope different we are um how how is his or
					is its language is technology uh what those the aliens like for example right  maybe they
					were very different or maybe the the science fiction is right and they have a they are very
					conflictive per um societies um right who knows yeah it's it's interesting really but it is an
					interesting topic um Okay so do you think that people I know you said you have a bit of a
					pessimistic view but do you think that humans people are more good or evil in general in general
					well um  they are indifferent right but we were talking about the most close persons to one
					we are usually good person right right um with the stranger we are very I'm free every different
					different with the strength but sometimes um some people very they will be very bad persons so to me
					is complicated to classify to the strength is good or bad I usually think that the the human brain
					is very very different to others to other person okay and I have I have one more question for you
					Miguel um what what would it mean for you to be successful what would you want in your life before
					you could feel like you are successful man um I don't think the necess for is related to to avoid I
					think is most related to to a small things the that you enjoyed okay  um  foreign
					foreign  okay okay yeah I agree that um helping the people we love and enjoying the little
					things the time with the people who we care about those are very important and uh I agree as well
					that it's not all about your goals met us it's uh important that you enjoy your life is to be
					successful yeah okay well I'm very impressed with your your English model really very good excellent
					excellent really you you understood every question I asked you you were able to to respond to these
					deeper questions and really express yourself I think that's awesome and uh I really think you should
					be you should be proud of yourself for that thank you so super cool I was uh I'm really happy to to
					speak with you I'll go ahead and stop recording now okay
